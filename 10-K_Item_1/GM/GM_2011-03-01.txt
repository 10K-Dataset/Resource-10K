Item 1. Business

Launch of the New General Motors

General Motors Company was formed by the UST in 2009, and prior to July 10, 2009, our business was operated by Old GM. On June 1, 2009, Old GM and three of its domestic direct and indirect
subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 (the Chapter 11 Proceedings) of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court). On July 10, 2009, we, through
certain of our subsidiaries, acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Old GM in connection with the 363 Sale closing.

Through our purchase of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Old GM in connection with the 363 Sale, we have launched a new company with a strong balance sheet, a
competitive cost structure, and a strong cash position, which we believe will enable us to compete more effectively with our U.S. and foreign-based competitors in the U.S. and to continue our strong presence in growing global markets. In particular,
we acquired assets that included Old GM’s strongest operations, and we believe we have a competitive operating cost structure, partly as a result of recent agreements with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture
Implement Workers of America (UAW) and Canadian Auto Workers Union (CAW).

We have a vision to design, build and sell the
world’s best vehicles. Our executive leadership and our employees are committed to:



•Building our market share, revenue, earnings and cash flow;



•Improving the quality of our cars and trucks, while increasing customer satisfaction and overall perception of our products; and



•Continuing to take a leadership role in the development of advanced energy saving technologies, including advanced combustion engines, biofuels,
fuel cells, hybrid vehicles, extended-range-electric vehicles, and advanced battery development.

Public Offering

In November and December 2010 we consummated a public offering of 550 million shares of our common stock and 100 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and listed our common stock on the
New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange and listed our Series B Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. We received net proceeds of $4.9 billion from the offering of the Series B Preferred Stock.

General

We develop, produce and market cars, trucks and parts worldwide. We also provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial).

Automotive

Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our four automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA), GM Europe (GME), GM International Operations (GMIO) and GM South America (GMSA).

In the year ended December 31, 2009 we combined our vehicle sales data, market share data and production volume data in
the period July 10, 2009 through December 31, 2009 with Old GM’s data in the period January 1, 2009 through July 9, 2009 for comparative purposes.

Our total worldwide vehicle sales were 8.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2010. Total combined GM and Old GM worldwide vehicle sales in the year ended December 31, 2009 were 7.5
million. Old GM’s total worldwide vehicle sales were 8.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2008. Substantially all of the cars, trucks and parts are marketed through retail dealers in North America, and through distributors and
dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned.

In the year ended
December 31, 2010 we completed the sale of Saab Automobile AB (Saab) in February 2010 and the sale of Saab Automobile GB (Saab GB) in May 2010 and have completed the wind down of our Pontiac, Saturn and HUMMER brands.

GMNA primarily meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the following
four brands:



•     Buick•     Cadillac•     Chevrolet•     GMC

The demands of customers outside North America are primarily met with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the
following brands:



•     Buick•     Daewoo•     Holden•     Opel•     Cadillac•     GMC•     Isuzu•     Vauxhall•     Chevrolet

At December 31, 2010 we had equity ownership stakes directly or indirectly in entities
through various regional subsidiaries, including GM Daewoo Auto & Technology Co. (GM Daewoo), Shanghai General Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM), SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SGMW), FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (FAW-GM) and
SAIC GM Investment Limited (HKJV). In 2011 SGMW plans to commence sales under the Baojun brand. In January 2011 GM Daewoo announced it will be changing its name to GM Korea and will sell most of its cars under the Chevrolet brand. These companies
design, manufacture and market vehicles under the following brands:



•     Buick•     Daewoo•     GMC•     Jiefang•     Cadillac•     FAW•     Holden•     Wuling•     Chevrolet

In addition to the products we sell to our dealers for consumer retail sales, we also sell cars
and trucks to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. We sell vehicles to fleet customers directly or through our network of dealers. Our retail and fleet customers can
obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.

Automotive Financing

On October 1, 2010 we completed the acquisition of AmeriCredit Corp. (AmeriCredit) for cash of approximately $3.5 billion and
changed its name to General Motors Financial Company, Inc.

GM Financial is a leading automotive finance company that has been
operating since 1992. GM Financial purchases automobile finance contracts for new and used vehicles purchased by consumers primarily from franchised and select independent dealerships. GM Financial predominantly offers financing to consumers who are
typically unable to obtain financing from more traditional sources. The typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700. GM Financial
services its loan portfolio at regional centers using automated loan servicing and collection systems. Since GM Financial provides financing in a relatively high-risk market, it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more
traditional sources of financing.

GM Financial finances its loan origination volume through the use of credit facilities and
securitization trusts that issue asset-backed securities to investors. GM Financial retains an interest in these securitization trusts that are over collateralized, whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the
amount of asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts, as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by GM Financial over the life of the securitization. Excess cash flows result from the difference
between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset-backed securities, net of credit losses and expenses.

Excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset-backed securities issued by the
securitization trusts. Once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained, excess cash flows are distributed to GM Financial or, in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure, may be used to accelerate the
repayment of certain subordinated securities. In addition to excess cash flows, GM Financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees, such as late charges, as servicer for securitization trusts.

In December 2010 GM Financial began offering a lease product in certain geographic areas through our franchised dealerships that targets
consumers with prime credit bureau scores leasing new GM vehicles. GM Financial expects to begin offering a nationwide lease product targeting consumers with prime and sub-prime credit scores in 2011.

Competitive Position

Information in this 2010 10-K relating to our relative position in the global automotive industry is based upon the good faith estimates
of management, and includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Market share information in this 2010 10-K is based on vehicle sales volume.

The global automotive industry is highly competitive. The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in
which we operate include price, quality, available options, style, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.

In the year ended December 31, 2010 our worldwide market share was 11.4%. Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended
December 31, 2010 are consistent with a gradual U.S. vehicle sales recovery from the negative economic effects of the U.S. recession first experienced by Old GM in the second half of 2008.

In the year ended December 31, 2009 combined GM and Old GM worldwide market share was 11.6%. In 2009 the U.S. continued to be
negatively affected by the economic factors experienced in 2008 as U.S. automotive industry sales declined 21.4% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008.

In the year ended December 31, 2008 Old GM’s worldwide market share was 12.3%. In 2008 worldwide market share was severely affected by the recession in Old GM’s largest market, the U.S.,
and the recession in Western Europe. Tightening of the credit markets, increases in the unemployment rate, declining consumer confidence as a result of declining household incomes and escalating public

speculation related to Old GM’s potential bankruptcy contributed to significantly lower vehicle sales in the U.S. These economic factors had a negative effect on the U.S. automotive industry
and the principal factors that determine consumers’ vehicle buying decisions. As a result, consumers delayed purchasing or leasing new vehicles which caused a decline in U.S. vehicle sales.

The following table summarizes the respective U.S. market shares in passenger cars and trucks:

Fleet Sales and Deliveries

The sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales. Fleet sales are
comprised of vehicle sales to daily rental car companies, as well as leasing companies and commercial fleet and government customers. Certain fleet transactions, particularly daily rental, are generally less profitable than retail sales. As part of
our pricing strategy, particularly in the U.S., we have improved our mix of sales to specific customers. In the accompanying tables fleet sales are presented as vehicle sales. A significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are
recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery.

Product Pricing

A number of methods are used to promote our products,
including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand
for our products. In 2011 we will continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required. We believe this strategy, coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen the
reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices.

Cyclical Nature of Business

In the automotive industry, retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur
throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles is cyclical and depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. In 2010 the global automotive industry, particularly in the U.S., had
not yet fully recovered from the negative economic factors experienced in 2008.

Relationship with Dealers

We market vehicles worldwide through a network of independent retail dealers and distributors. At December 31, 2010 there were 4,458
vehicle dealers in the U.S., 465 in Canada and 244 in Mexico and other Central American locations. Additionally, there were a total of 15,048 distribution outlets throughout the rest of the world. These outlets include distributors, dealers and
authorized sales, service and parts outlets.

The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



As part of achieving and sustaining long-term viability and the viability of our dealer
network, we determined that a reduction in the number of GMNA dealerships was necessary. In determining which dealerships would remain in our network we performed analyses of volumes and consumer satisfaction indexes, among other criteria. Refer to
the section of this report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Specific Management Initiatives — U.S. Dealer Reduction” for a further discussion on our U.S.
dealer reduction.

We enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified
product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from a GM approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand of vehicle at a single dealership. In fact, we actively
promote this for several of our brands in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized GM dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell, using genuine GM
parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program, and those repairs are to be made only with genuine GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease
financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial, Ally Financial, Inc., formerly GMAC, Inc. (Ally Financial) and other financial institutions.

Because dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the ultimate consumer of our products, the quality of GM
dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those
contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

Costs for research,
manufacturing engineering, product engineering, and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to vehicle emissions control,
improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers.

Research

Overview

Our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy, as energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business
strategy. Our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption. To meet this objective we focus on five specific areas:



•Continue to increase the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks;



•Develop alternative fuel vehicles;



•Invest significantly in our hybrid and electric technologies;



•Invest significantly in plug-in electric vehicle technology; and



•Continue development of hydrogen fuel cell technology.

Fuel Efficiency

We and Old GM have complied with federal fuel economy requirements since their inception in 1978, and we are fully committed to meeting
the requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and compliance with other regulatory schemes, including the California vehicle greenhouse gas emissions program. We anticipate steadily improving fuel economy for both our
car and truck fleets. We are committed to meeting or exceeding all federal fuel economy standards in the 2011 through 2016 model years. We plan to achieve compliance through a combination of strategies, including: (1) extensive technology
improvements to conventional powertrains; (2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and six speed automatic transmissions; (3) vehicle improvements, including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures;
(4) increased hybrid and electric vehicle offerings; and (5) portfolio changes, including increasing car/crossover mix and dropping select larger vehicles in favor of smaller, more fuel efficient offerings.

We are committed to lead in the development of technologies to increase the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engines such as
cylinder deactivation, direct injection, turbo-charging with engine downsizing, six speed transmissions and variable valve timing. As a full-line manufacturer that produces a wide variety of cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles, we currently
offer 13 models (2011 model year) obtaining 30 mpg or more in highway driving.

Alternative Fuel Vehicles

We have been in the forefront in the development of alternative fuel vehicles, leveraging experience and capability developed around
these technologies in our operations in Brazil. Alternative fuels offer the greatest near-term potential to reduce petroleum consumption in the transportation sector, especially as cellulosic sources of ethanol become more affordable and readily
available in the U.S.

We currently offer 19 FlexFuel vehicles for the 2011 model year, estimated to be 40% of our U.S.
vehicle sales, capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. As part of an overall energy diversity strategy, we remain committed to making at least 50% of the vehicles we produce for the U.S. capable of operating on
biofuels, specifically E85 ethanol, by 2012, assuming the appropriate infrastructure growth materializes. However, recent regulatory developments occurring in the fourth quarter of 2010 have altered our previous FlexFuel vehicle production goals
beyond 2012. We are currently evaluating the effects of these regulatory developments.

We are focused on promoting
sustainable biofuels derived from non-food sources, such as agricultural, forestry and municipal waste. We are continuing to work with our two strategic alliances with cellulosic ethanol makers: Coskata, Inc., of Warrenville, Illinois, and New
Hampshire based Mascoma Corp. In October 2009, Coskata, Inc. opened its semi-commercial facility for manufacturing cellulosic ethanol and Mascoma Corp. has been making cellulosic ethanol at its Rome, New York, demonstration plant since late 2008.

We are supporting the development of biodiesel, a clean-burning alternative diesel fuel that is produced from renewable
sources. In 2011 model year full-size pickups and vans, B20 capability is standard on our Duramax 6.6L turbo diesel engine. The Duramax diesel engine is available in the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pickups and Chevrolet Express and
GMC Savana full-size vans.

We have announced that Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) powered
versions of the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans will be offered to fleet and commercial customers. We are currently accepting orders for the CNG cargo vans, and the LPG van cutaway models will begin production by the second quarter
of 2011. The vans have specially designed engines for the gaseous fuels and come direct to the customer with the fully integrated and warranted dedicated gaseous fuel system in place.

Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles

We are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles with extended-range technology. We
currently offer seven hybrid models. We continue to develop plug-in

hybrid electric vehicle technology (PHEV) which includes the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera electric vehicles with extended range capabilities. We plan to invest heavily between 2011 and 2012 to
support the expansion of our electrified vehicle offerings and in-house development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries, electric motors and power control systems.

The GM Two-mode Hybrid system is offered with the automotive industry’s only hybrid full-size trucks and sport utility vehicles:
Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Yukon and Yukon Denali, GMC Sierra, Cadillac Escalade and Escalade Platinum.

PHEV, using a modified version of our Two-Mode Hybrid system and advanced lithium-ion battery technology, is scheduled to launch in 2012. The PHEV will provide low-speed electric-only propulsion, and blend engine and battery power to significantly
improve fuel efficiency.

The Chevrolet Volt is an electric vehicle with extended range capability. For the first 25 to 50
miles, depending on terrain, driving technique, temperature and battery age, the Chevrolet Volt operates as a full-performance battery electric vehicle powered only by electricity. Once the battery is depleted, the Chevrolet Volt’s onboard
engine generates the energy needed to power the vehicle over 300 additional miles on a full tank of premium fuel. Production of the 2011 Chevrolet Volt began in November 2010. The Chevrolet Volt arrived in dealerships in select U.S. geographic
markets in December 2010, and we plan to have Chevrolet Volts available in all participating dealerships in the U.S. by the end of 2011. A second electric vehicle with extended range, the Opel Ampera, is scheduled to launch in Europe in late 2011.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology

OnStar

Advancements in telematics (wireless voice and data) technology are demonstrated through our OnStar service. OnStar’s in-vehicle safety, security and communications service is available on more than
40 of our 2011 model year vehicles and currently serves 6 million subscribers in the U.S., Canada and China. In China, OnStar increased in-vehicle telematics services to more than 170,000 subscribers. OnStar’s key services include:
Automatic Crash Response, Stolen Vehicle Assistance, Turn-by-Turn Navigation, OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics and Hands-Free Calling. In 2010 we offered OnStar eNav, a feature of Turn-by-Turn Navigation, available through Google Maps. OnStar subscribers
are able to search for and identify destinations using Google Maps and send those destinations to their vehicles. They can then access the destinations whenever they choose and receive OnStar Turn-by-Turn directions to the destination from wherever
they are. Also in 2010, Chevrolet and OnStar unveiled the automotive industry’s first

working smartphone application, which will allow Chevrolet Volt owners 24/7 connection and remote control of vehicle functions and OnStar features. OnStar’s Mobile Application allows drivers
to communicate with their Chevrolet Volt from Motorola Droid, Apple iPhone and Blackberry Storm smartphones. It uses a real-time data connection to perform tasks from setting the charge time to unlocking the doors.

In 2009 OnStar developed an Injury Severity Prediction system based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert
panel which allows OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. Data from OnStar’s Automatic Crash Response system will be used to automatically calculate the Injury
Severity Prediction which can assist responders in determining the level of care required and the transport destination for patients. OnStar has also expanded its Stolen Vehicle Assistance services with the announcement of Remote Ignition Block.
This will allow an OnStar Advisor to send a remote signal to a subscriber’s stolen vehicle to prevent the vehicle from restarting once the ignition is turned off. We believe that this capability will not only help authorities recover stolen
vehicles, but can also prevent or shorten dangerous high speed pursuits.

Other Technologies

Other safety systems include the third generation of our StabiliTrak electronic stability control system. The system maximizes handling
and braking by using a combination of systems and sensors including anti-lock braking systems (ABS), traction control, suspension and steering. Our Lane Departure Warning System and Side Blind Zone Alert Systems extend and enhance driver awareness
and vision.

Product Development

Our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization. This strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development.

Under our global vehicle architecture strategy and for each of our ten global architectures, we define a global architecture as a
specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces.

A centralized organization is responsible for many of the non-visible parts of the vehicle such as steering, suspension, the brake system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and the
electrical system. This team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world, who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand, such as exterior and interior design, tuning of the vehicle to meet
the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements.

We currently have ten
different global architectures that are assigned to regional centers around the world. The allocation of the architectures to specific regions is based on where the expertise for the vehicle segment resides, e.g., mini and small vehicles in Asia
Pacific, compact vehicles in Europe and midsize, crossover, and rear-wheel drive vehicles in North America. We are engineering most of these global architectures to enable various electric propulsion systems, rather than having unique architectures
for hybrids, plug-in hybrids, extended-range electric and electric vehicles.

The ten global architectures are:



•      Mini•      Midsize Truck•      Small•      Small Sport Utility Vehicle•      Compact•      Compact Sport Utility Vehicle•      Midsize•      Small Rear-Wheel Drive•      Midsize Crossover•      Large Rear-Wheel Drive

We plan to increase the volume of vehicles produced from common global architectures to more than 50% of our total volumes in 2015 from
less than 17% today.

Intellectual Property

We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While
none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our
identity and recognition in the marketplace.

Raw Materials, Services and Supplies

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers
for use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials are primarily composed of steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry
substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements. In 2009 the weakening of commodity prices experienced in the latter part of 2008 was generally reversed with prices returning
to more historical levels by year end. In early 2010, our costs increased further as commodity prices increased faster than expected due to economic growth in China and speculative activity in the commodity markets. During the middle part of 2010
there was a slight leveling of commodity prices due to European sovereign debt issues and concerns over a slowdown in China, but commodity prices have returned to steady price increases during the last few months of 2010.

In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply
disruptions. Based on our standard payment terms with our systems, components and parts suppliers, we are generally required to pay most of these suppliers on average 47 days following receipt with weekly disbursements.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Automotive Emissions Control

We are subject to laws and
regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic system (OBD) requirements, in the regions throughout the world in which we sell
cars, trucks and heavy-duty engines.

North America

The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S., and additional requirements are
imposed by various state governments, most notably California. These requirements include pre-production testing of vehicles, testing of vehicles after assembly, the imposition of emission defect and performance warranties and the obligation to
recall and repair customer owned vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements. We must obtain certification that the vehicles will meet emission requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in
the U.S. and Canada and from the CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements.

The EPA and the CARB continue to emphasize testing on vehicles sold in the U.S. for compliance with these emissions requirements. We believe that our vehicles meet the current EPA and CARB requirements.
If our vehicles do not comply with the emission standards or if defective emission control systems or components are discovered in such testing, or as part of government required defect reporting, we could incur substantial costs related to
emissions recalls and possible fines. We expect that new CARB and federal requirements will increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle’s emission performance.

The current EPA and the CARB emission requirements are referred to as Tier 2 and Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) II. Fleet-wide compliance
with the Tier 2 and LEV II standards must be achieved based on a sales-weighted fleet average. President Obama has







CONFIDENTIAL

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



directed the EPA to review its vehicle emission standards, and if the EPA finds that more stringent emission regulations are necessary, to promulgate such regulations. The CARB is developing its
next generation emission standards, LEV III, which will further increase the stringency of its emission standards. We expect the LEV III requirements to be adopted as early as the fourth quarter of 2011 and to be phased in beginning with the 2014
model year. Both the EPA and the CARB have enacted regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases. Since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of fuel economy requirement, they are discussed under “Automotive Fuel
Economy.”

California law requires that 11% of 2011 model year cars and certain light-duty trucks sold in the state must
be zero emission vehicles (ZEV), such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year. Manufacturers have the option of meeting a
portion of this requirement with partial ZEV credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission system warranties. An additional portion of the ZEV requirement can be met with vehicles
that meet these partial ZEV requirements and incorporate advanced technology, such as a hybrid electric propulsion system meeting specified criteria. Beginning in 2012, an additional portion of the ZEV requirement can be met with PHEVs that meet the
partial ZEV requirements and certain other criteria. We are complying with the ZEV requirements using a variety of means, including producing vehicles certified to the partial ZEV requirements. CARB has also announced plans to adopt, as early as the
fourth quarter of 2011, 2018 model year and later requirements for ZEVs and PHEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state’s long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals.

The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck
emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Twelve states, including New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Oregon, Washington, Maryland and New Mexico, as well as the Province of
Quebec, currently have these standards in effect, although New Mexico has waived its requirements through 2016 effective January 2011. Arizona has adopted the California standards effective beginning in the 2012 model year and Delaware has adopted
those standards beginning in the 2014 model year. Additional states could also adopt the California standards in the future.

Advanced OBD systems, used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems, are required under U.S. federal, Canadian
federal and California law. Problems detected by the OBD system have the potential of increasing warranty costs and the chance for recall. OBD requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new
diagnostics are required. California has adopted more stringent and technically challenging OBD requirements that take effect from the 2008 through 2013 model years, including new design requirements and corresponding enforcement procedures. We have
implemented hardware and software changes to comply with these more stringent requirements.

The federal Tier 2 requirements
for evaporative emissions are being harmonized with the California evaporative emission requirements beginning with a 2009 model year phase-in. California plans to further increase the stringency of its evaporative emission requirements as part of
its LEV III rulemaking.

Vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements, and
could be recalled, or fines could be imposed against us, should testing or defect reporting identify a noncompliance with these emission requirements. For the 2011 model year, certain gasoline and diesel-powered Chevrolet Silverados, GMC Sierra
Pickups, Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana Vans are classified as heavy-duty and subject to these requirements. We also certify heavy-duty engines for installation in other manufacturers’ products. The heavy-duty exhaust standards became more
stringent in the 2010 model year. As permitted by EPA and CARB regulations, we are using a system of credits, referred to as Averaging Banking and Trading, to help meet these stringent standards. OBD requirements were first applied to heavy-duty
vehicles beginning with the 2010 model year, which we are meeting with certain hardware and software changes.

Europe

In Europe, emissions are regulated by two different entities: the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations
Economic Commission for Europe (UN ECE). The EC imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 European







CONFIDENTIAL

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



Union (EU) Member States, and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the UN ECE. EU Member States can give tax incentives to automobile manufacturers for vehicles which meet
emission standards earlier than the compliance date. This can result in specific market requirements for automobile manufacturers to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the EC emission standards. The current EC
requirements include type approval of preproduction testing of vehicles, testing of vehicles after assembly and the obligation to recall and repair vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements. EC and UN ECE requirements are equivalent in
terms of stringency and implementation. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and obtain type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the EU Member States.

Emission requirements in Europe will become even more stringent in the future. A new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and
light-duty trucks, Euro 5 standards, was applied in 2009, while stricter Euro 6 standards will apply beginning in 2014. The OBD requirements associated with these new standards will become more challenging as well. The new European emission
standards focus particularly on reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. Diesel vehicles have become important in the European marketplace, where they encompass 50% of the market share. The new requirements will require additional technologies and
further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines. To comply with Euro 6, we expect that we will need to implement technologies which are identical to those being developed to meet U.S. emission standards.
The technologies available today are not cost effective and would therefore not be suitable for the European market for small- and mid-size diesel vehicles, which typically are under high cost pressure. Certain measures to reduce exhaust pollutant
emissions have detrimental effects on vehicle fuel economy, which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy.

In the long-term, notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in Europe, regulatory discussions in Europe are expected to continue.
Regulators will continue to refine the testing requirements addressing issues such as test cycle, durability, OBD, in-service conformity and off-cycle emissions.

South America

In South America, some countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and some follow the EU test procedures,
standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. Brazil implemented national LEV standards, L5, which preceded Tier 2 standards in the U.S., for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2009. L6 standards for light diesel
vehicles are to be implemented in 2012, which mandate OBD requirements for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in 2014 for new vehicles and 2015 for all models. Argentina implemented Euro 4
standards starting with new vehicle registrations in 2009 and is moving to Euro 5 standards in 2012 for new vehicles and 2014 for all models. Chile currently requires U.S. Tier 1 or Euro 3 standards for gasoline vehicles and U.S.
Tier 2 Bin 8 or Euro 4 standards for diesel vehicles and has approved U.S. Tier 2 Bin 8 or Euro 4 standards for gasoline vehicles beginning in April 2011 and U.S. Tier 2 Bin 5 or Euro 5 standards for diesel
vehicles beginning in September 2011. Other countries in the South America region either have adopted some level of U.S. or EU standards or no standards at all.

Industrial Environmental Control

Our operations are subject to a
wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental cleanup. In connection with the 363 Sale we have assumed various stages of investigation for sites where
contamination has been alleged and a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault,
legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability, as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.

The future effect of environmental matters, including potential liabilities, is often difficult to estimate. Environmental reserves are
recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. This practice is followed whether the claims are asserted or unasserted. At December 31, 2010 our reserves for
environmental liabilities were $195 million. The amount of current reserves is expected to be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which typically range from five to 30 years.

The following table summarizes the expenditures for site-remediation actions, including ongoing operations and maintenance (dollars in
millions):



SuccessorPredecessorYear EndedDecember 31, 2010July 10,
2009ThroughDecember 31, 2009January 1, 
2009ThroughJuly 9, 2009Year EndedDecember 31, 2008Site remediation expenses$19$3$34$94

It is possible that
such remediation actions could require average annual expenditures of $30 million over the next five years.

Certain
remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible are not reasonably estimable because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials located at the site, the involvement of
other potentially responsible parties, the application of laws and other standards or regulations, site conditions and the nature and scope of investigations, studies and remediation to be undertaken (including the technologies to be required and
the extent, duration and success of remediation). As a result, we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the total amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with all sites, although that total
could be substantial.

To mitigate the effects our worldwide facilities have on the environment, we are committed to convert
as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfill-free facilities. Landfill-free facilities send no manufacturing waste to landfills, by either recycling or creating energy from the waste. As part of our commitment to reduce the
environmental effect resulting from our worldwide facilities, our goal was to convert half of our major global manufacturing operations to landfill-free facilities by 2010. In 2010 we achieved this







CONFIDENTIAL

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



goal with 76 landfill-free facilities, which is 52% of our worldwide facilities. At our landfill-free facilities, over 96% of waste materials are recycled or reused and 3% is converted to energy
at waste-to-energy facilities. We estimate that we recycled or reused over 1.9 million tons of waste materials and estimate that we converted 38,800 tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities in the year ended
December 31, 2010. These numbers will increase as additional manufacturing sites reach landfill-free status.

We are continuing to implement our global energy strategy with a goal to increase our green power purchases. Our web-based data collection and management system is an integrated application designed to
monitor and measure energy use as well as calculate the related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, including collecting and verifying energy, water, and other environmental data from facilities around the globe. We manage our greenhouse gas emissions using an integrated systems approach.
This integrated systems approach includes a greenhouse gas reporting policy, global process to collect accurate data, internal and external targets and reporting progress against the established targets.

Automotive Fuel Economy

North America

The 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) provided
for average fuel economy requirements for fleets of passenger cars built for the 1978 model year and thereafter. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) reporting is required for three separate fleets, domestically produced cars, imported cars and
light-duty trucks. In 2010 car standards were fixed at 27.5 mpg while the light duty trucks standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes. The following table summarizes our estimated CAFE
compliance standards and our projected compliance (in mpg):

(b)Reported in our Official 2011 Pre-Model Year Automotive Fuel Economy Report to NHTSA.



(c)Beginning in 2011 all three fleet’s standards are reformed (i.e., based on vehicle size and vehicle model sales volumes).

In response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, the EPA was directed to establish a new program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions for
vehicles under the Clean Air Act. In April 2010 the EPA and the NHTSA issued a joint final rule to implement a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for model year 2012 through 2016 light-duty vehicles that will reduce
greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act and improve fuel economy pursuant to the CAFE standards under the EPCA. These reform-based standards apply to 2012 through 2016 model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger
vehicles (collectively, light-duty vehicles) and will require an industry wide standard of 35.5 mpg by 2016. Our current product plan projects compliance with the federal programs through 2016.

Environment Canada, an agency established to preserve and enhance the quality of the natural environment and coordinate environmental
policies and programs for the Canadian federal government, implemented vehicle greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with the mandatory standards of the U.S. beginning with the 2011 model year. The Province of Quebec has indicated that it
will align its vehicle greenhouse gas regulation to the Canadian federal government requirements once they are finalized.

California has passed legislation (AB 1493) requiring the CARB to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles (which is the same as
regulating fuel economy). This California program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years. California needed a federal waiver to implement this program and was granted this waiver in June 2009.







CONFIDENTIAL

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed
to be compliance with the California program for 2012 through 2016 model years. California’s program to regulate vehicle greenhouse gases is separately in effect for the 2009 through 2011 model years. The following table summarizes
California’s program compliance standards and our projected compliance (in grams per mile CO2-equivalent):

(a)Our performance projections for the 2011 model year for passenger cars is projected to be more than the standard. We are still projecting compliance in 2011 due to the
allowed use of credits earned in previous years.

Europe

In Europe, legislation was passed in 2009 to regulate vehicle CO


emissions beginning in 2012. Based on a target function of CO


to vehicle weight, each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific
sales weighted fleet average target. This fleet average requirement will be phased in with 65% of vehicles sold in 2012 required to meet this target, 75% in 2013, 80% in 2014 and 100% in 2015 and beyond. Automobile manufacturers can earn
super-credits under this legislation for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific CO


value of less than 50 grams CO


. This is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultra-low
CO


vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera by
providing an additional incentive to reduce the CO


fleet
average. Automobile manufacturers may gain credit of up to seven grams for eco-innovations for those technologies which improve real-world fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle, such as solar panels on vehicles. There is also a 5% credit
for E85 FlexFuel vehicles if more than 30% of refueling stations in an EU Member State sell E85. Further regulatory detail is being developed in the comitology process, which develops the detail of the regulatory requirements through a process
involving the EC and EU Member States. The legislation sets a target of 95 grams per kilometer CO


for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement. We have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational CO


targets for each market entry in Europe.

In 2009 the European Commission adopted a proposal to regulate CO2emissions from light commercial vehicles. The proposal is modeled after
the CO2regulation for passenger cars. It proposes that new
light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average CO2target of
175 grams per kilometer CO2with a phase-in of compliance
beginning with 75% of new light commercial vehicles by 2014, 80% by 2015 and 100% compliance by 2016. The manufacturer-specific CO2compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel
(vehicle curb weight). Flexibilities, such as eco-innovations and super credits, are part of the regulatory proposal as well. A long-term target for 2020 of 135g/km has been also proposed, to be confirmed in 2013 after an impact assessment. We are
currently performing an assessment of the effect of the proposal on our fleet of light commercial vehicles. The proposal will now go through the legislative process with the European Parliament and European Council, during which we expect some
modifications to be adopted.

An EC regulation has been adopted that will require low-rolling resistance tires, tire pressure
monitoring systems and gear shift indicators by 2012. An additional EC regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise, fuel efficiency and rolling resistance, affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of
tires in the aftermarket.

Seventeen EU Member States have introduced fuel consumption or CO2based vehicle taxation schemes. Tax measures are within the jurisdiction
of the EU Member States. We are faced with significant challenges relative to the predictability of future tax laws and differences in the tax schemes and thresholds.

International Operations

In our international operations, we face new or
increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards. In China, Phase 3 fuel economy standards are under development and will move from a vehicle pass-fail system to a curb-weight based, corporate fleet







CONFIDENTIAL

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



average scheme. Phase 3 fuel economy standards are expected to increase by 15% or more from the current Phase 2 targets and implementation is expected to be phased in from 2012 with full
compliance required by 2015. Some relief for certain vehicle types and vehicles with automatic transmissions will be applied through 2015. In 2016 there will be one common standard for vehicles with either a manual or automatic transmission. China
is also considering proposals to increase annual vehicle taxes, and to scale the tax rates to more heavily tax larger displacement engines beginning in 2012. In Korea, new preliminary fuel economy/CO


targets for 2012 through 2015 and beyond were announced in September
2010 as part of the government’s low carbon/green growth strategy. These targets are based on each vehicle’s curb weight, but in general are set at levels more stringent than fuel economy/CO


targets in the U.S., but less stringent than fuel economy/CO


targets in Europe. The proposed standards will be phased-in beginning in
2012 and finishing in 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify either on a fuel consumption basis or a
CO


emissions basis. Each manufacturer will be given a
corporate target to meet based on an overall industry fleet fuel economy/CO


average. Other aspects of the program being considered include credits, incentives, and penalties. In January 2011 Korea announced the exemption level for compliance by small volume manufacturers as
discussed in the Korea-U.S. and Korea-EU free trade agreement negotiations. Manufacturers with sales volumes of less than 4,500 units in 2009 will meet the small volume manufacturer’s exemption and will be subject to less stringent
requirements. Korea is expected to finalize and promulgate the new fuel economy/CO


regulation in the first quarter of 2011. In Australia, the government is conducting an assessment of possible vehicle fuel efficiency measures including shifting from voluntary to mandatory standards and
how any such move would align with the government’s policy response to climate change. Before the government makes any decisions on additional fuel efficiency measures, it will conduct an industry consultation. India is expected to establish
fuel economy norms based on weight and measured in CO


emissions that will become mandatory in 2015. The Indian government is considering establishing voluntary limits in 2012, mandatory limits in 2015 with a 12.4% decrease from 2012 values and a 13.0% drop from 2015 limits by 2020. In 2009 automobile
manufacturers in India began to voluntarily declare the fuel economy of each vehicle at the point of sale. In South Africa,
CO


emissions are not regulated, but a new CO


emission tax went into effect for all new passenger cars in September
2010 with the exception of double cabbed light commercial vehicles, for which implementation is delayed until March 2011.

South America

In Brazil, governmental bodies and the Brazilian automobile manufacturers association established a national voluntary program for evaluation and labeling of light passenger and commercial vehicles
equipped with internal combustion engines. This voluntary program aims to increase vehicle energy efficiency by labeling vehicles with fuel consumption measurements for urban, extra-urban and combined (equivalent to city and highway mpg measurements
in the U.S.) driving conditions.

Chemical Regulations

North America

In the U.S., the EPA and several states have introduced regulations or legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives, green chemistry and product stewardship initiatives as
have several provinces in Canada. These initiatives will give broad regulatory authority over the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers’ responsibilities for vehicle life-cycle, including chemical
substance selection for product development and manufacturing. Although vehicles may not specifically be included in the regulations currently being developed, automotive sector effects are expected because substances that comprise components may be
included. These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in cost and supply chain complexity. California’s “Safer Alternatives for Consumer Products” was the first of these regulations although implementation
requirements have been delayed beyond 2010.

Europe

In 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances
(REACH). This regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU in quantities of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency before 2018. During REACH’s pre-registration
phase, Old GM







CONFIDENTIAL

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



and our suppliers registered those substances identified by the regulation. REACH is to be phased in over a 10 year period. During the implementation phase, REACH will require ongoing action from
manufacturers and importers of pure chemical substances, chemical preparations (mixtures), and articles. This will affect us, as an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), as well as our suppliers and other suppliers in the supply chain. Under REACH,
substances of very high concern may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future. This could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result
in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines. Our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future REACH requirements. In order to maintain compliance, we are continually
monitoring the implementation of REACH and its effect on our suppliers and the automotive industry.

Safety

New motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment sold in the U.S. are required to meet certain safety standards
promulgated by the NHTSA. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 authorized the NHTSA to determine these standards and the schedule for implementing them. In the case of a vehicle defect that creates an unreasonable risk to motor
vehicle safety or if a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer
complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S., as well as information concerning safety recalls and other safety
campaigns outside the U.S.

We are subject to certain safety standards and recall regulations in the markets outside the U.S.
These standards often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards, but may differ in their requirements and test procedures. From time to time, other countries pass regulations which are more stringent than U.S. standards. Many countries require
type approval while the U.S. and Canada require self-certification.

Vehicular Noise Control

Vehicles we manufacture and sell may be subject to noise emission regulations.

In the U.S., passenger cars and light-duty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations. We are committed to
designing and developing our products to meet these noise regulations. Since addressing different vehicle noise regulations established in numerous state and local jurisdictions is not practical, we attempt to identify the most stringent
requirements and validate to those requirements. In the rare instances where a state or local noise regulation is not covered by the composite requirement, a waiver of the requirement is requested and to date the resolution of these matters has not
resulted in significant cost or other material adverse effects to us. Medium to heavy-duty trucks are regulated at the federal level. Federal truck regulations preempt all United States state or local noise regulations for trucks over 10,000 lbs.
gross vehicle weight rating.

Outside the U.S., noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and
supranational level (e.g., EC or UN ECE for Europe). We believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold.

While current noise emission regulations serve to regulate maximum allowable noise levels, proposals have been made to regulate minimum noise levels. These proposals stem from concern that vehicles that
are relatively quiet, specifically hybrids, may not be heard by the sight-impaired. In the U.S., the Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act was signed into law in January 2011 which requires NHTSA to study and then issue rulemaking on the minimum safe
level of sound for hybrid and electrical vehicles. In Japan, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport has issued guidelines on the performance and nature of any external audible pedestrian alert system, if fitted to a vehicle. The UN ECE
is evaluating the use of a version of the Japanese guideline as an interim measure, pending further study. We are committed to design and manufacture vehicles to comply with potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals.

Potential Effect of Regulations

We are actively working on aggressive near-term and long-term plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions, mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental
liabilities, improve fuel efficiency, monitor and

enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers. This is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles, our accelerated
commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles, our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of FlexFuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our
vehicles. The conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfill-free status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability. We believe that the development and global implementation of new, cost-effective energy
technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities.

Despite these advanced technology efforts, our ability to satisfy fuel economy,
CO2and other emissions requirements is contingent on various
future economic, consumer, legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control and cannot predict with certainty. If we are not able to comply with specific new requirements, which include higher CAFE standards and state CO2requirements such as those imposed by the AB 1493 Rules, then we could
be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. Environmental liabilities, for which we may be responsible, are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. Violations of safety
or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products. In turn, any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations, including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of
revenue.

Pension Legislation

We are subject to a variety of federal rules and regulations, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA), which govern
the manner in which we fund and administer our pensions for our retired employees and their spouses. The PPA is designed, among other things, to more appropriately reflect the fair value of pension assets and liabilities in order to determine
funding requirements. The Pension Relief Act of 2010 provides us with additional options to amortize any shortfall amortization base for U.S. hourly and salaried qualified pension plans over seven years with amortization starting two years after the
election of this relief or 15 years. While we do not need to make an election at this time, we expect to evaluate these options for the 2010 and 2011 plan years in the future. We do not have any required contributions in 2011. If we decide to elect
one of these options, it could provide us with the flexibility to defer and potentially reduce the size of any minimum funding requirements for future years. We also maintain pension plans for employees in a number of countries outside the U.S.,
which are subject to local laws and regulations.

Export Control

We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce, and
Treasury. Most countries in which we do business have applicable export controls. Our Office of Export Compliance and global Export Compliance Officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and
regulations. Non-U.S. export controls are likely to become increasingly significant to our business as we develop our research and development operations on a global basis. If we fail to comply with applicable export compliance regulations, we and
our employees could be subject to criminal and civil penalties and, under certain circumstances, loss of export privileges and debarment from doing business with the U.S. government and the governments of other countries.

Significant Transactions

Public Offering

In November and December 2010 we consummated a public offering of 550 million shares of our common stock and 100 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and listed our common stock on the
New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange and listed our Series B Preferred Stock on the New York Stock Exchange. We received net proceeds of $4.9 billion from the offering of the Series B Preferred Stock.

Purchase of Series A Preferred Stock and Contributions to Pension Plans

In December 2010 we used proceeds received from our Series B Preferred Stock offering along with $1.2 billion cash on
hand to purchase 84 million shares of our Series A Preferred Stock from the UST for a purchase price of $2.1 billion and make a $4.0 billion cash contribution to our U.S. hourly and salaried pension plans. In January 2011 we contributed
61 million shares of our common stock to our U.S. hourly and salaried pension plans valued at $2.2 billion for funding purposes. Refer to the section of this report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
— Specific Management Initiatives” for additional information about the purchase of Series A Preferred Stock and contributions to U.S. hourly and salaried pension plans.

Secured Revolving Credit Facility

In October 2010 we entered into a five year, $5.0 billion secured revolving credit facility. While we do not believe that we will be required to draw on the secured revolving credit facility to fund
operating activities, the facility is expected to provide additional liquidity and financing flexibility. Refer to the section of this report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition — Liquidity and
Capital Resources — Secured Revolving Credit Facility” for additional information about the secured revolving credit facility.

Acquisition of AmeriCredit

On October 1, 2010 we completed
the acquisition of AmeriCredit for cash of approximately $3.5 billion.

363 Sale

On July 10, 2009, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Old GM and
three of its domestic direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Sellers). The 363 Sale was consummated in accordance with the Purchase Agreement, between us and the Sellers, and pursuant to the Bankruptcy Court’s sale order dated
July 5, 2009 (Purchase Agreement). Refer to the section of this report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Chapter 11 Proceedings and the 363 Sale” for additional
information about the 363 Sale.

In connection with the 363 Sale, we also entered into a secured note agreement, as amended
(VEBA Note Agreement) with the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (New VEBA) and issued the notes thereunder (VEBA Notes) to the New VEBA in the principal amount of $2.5 billion on July 10, 2009. The VEBA Notes had an implied interest rate of
9.0% per annum and were scheduled to be repaid in three equal installments of $1.4 billion on July 15 of 2013, 2015 and 2017. In October 2010, we repaid in full the outstanding amount (together with accreted interest thereon) of the VEBA
Notes of $2.8 billion.

Agreements with UST and EDC

On July 10, 2009 we entered into a secured credit agreement with the UST (as amended, UST Credit Agreement) and assumed debt of $7.1
billion Old GM incurred under the DIP Facility (as subsequently defined). Through our wholly-owned subsidiary General Motors of Canada (GMCL), we entered into an amended and restated loan agreement (Canadian Loan Agreement) with Export Development
of Canada (EDC) and assumed a CAD $1.5 billion (equivalent to $1.3 billion when entered into) term loan maturing on July 10, 2015 (Canadian Loan). Proceeds of the DIP Facility of $16.4 billion were deposited in escrow, to be distributed to us
at our request if certain conditions were met and returned to us after the UST Loans and the Canadian Loan were repaid in full. Immediately after entering into the UST Credit Agreement, we made a partial pre-payment due to the termination of the
U.S. government sponsored warranty program, reducing the principal balance to $6.7 billion.

In April 2010 we used funds from
our escrow account to repay in full the outstanding amount of the UST Loans of $4.7 billion and GMCL repaid in full the then-outstanding amount of the Canadian Loan of $1.1 billion. Both loans were repaid prior to maturity. Following our repayment
of the UST Loans and the Canadian Loan, our remaining funds of $6.6 billion that were held in escrow

became unrestricted. Refer to the section of this report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital
Resources — UST Loans and Canadian Loan” for additional information about the UST Loans and Canadian Loan.

Agreement with Delphi Corporation

In July 2009, we entered into the Delphi Master Distribution Agreement (DMDA) with Delphi Corporation (Delphi) and other parties. Under the DMDA, we agreed to acquire Nexteer, which supplies us and other
OEMs with steering systems and columns, and four domestic facilities that manufacture a variety of automotive components, primarily sold to us. We and several third party investors agreed to acquire substantially all of Delphi’s remaining
assets through New Delphi and certain excluded assets and liabilities have been retained by a Delphi entity to be sold or liquidated. In October 2009, we consummated the transaction contemplated by the DMDA with Delphi, New Delphi, Old GM and other
sellers and other buyers that are party to the agreement, as more fully described in Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Refer to the section of this report entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations — Specific Management Initiatives — Resolution of Delphi Matters” for a description of the terms of the DMDA and related agreements.
