Item 1.Business

Launch of General Motors Company

Prior to July 10, 2009 Old GM
operated the business of the Company, and pursuant to the agreement with the SEC Staff, the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements and related information of Old GM as it is our predecessor entity solely for
accounting and financial reporting purposes. On June 1, 2009 Old GM and three of its domestic direct and indirect subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 (Chapter 11 Proceedings) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
(Bankruptcy Code) in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court). On July 10, 2009 in connection with the 363 Sale, we, through certain of our subsidiaries, acquired substantially all of the assets and
assumed certain liabilities of Old GM. MLC continues to exist as a distinct legal entity for the sole purpose of liquidating its remaining assets and liabilities.

Through our purchase of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of Old GM in connection with the 363 Sale, we have launched a new company with a strong balance sheet, a
competitive cost structure, and a strong cash position, which we believe will enable us to compete more effectively with our U.S. and foreign-based competitors in the U.S. and to continue our strong presence in growing global markets. In particular,
we acquired Old GM’s strongest operations and we believe we will have a competitive operating cost structure, partly as a result of recent agreements with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers
of America (UAW) and Canadian Auto Workers Union (CAW).

In addition the formation of General Motors Company comes with a
renewed vision to design, build and sell the world’s best vehicles. In order to implement this renewed vision, a majority of our Board of Directors is comprised of directors that did not serve on Old GM’s Board of Directors, and we have
recently appointed new executive leadership, including our CEO and CFO. We have also recently installed a smaller executive committee, which meets more frequently than prior leadership committees, resulting in faster decision making and increased
accountability.

Our executive leadership and our employees are committed to:



•Building our market share, revenue, earnings and cash flow with the goal of paying back in 2010 our loans from the UST and Export Development Canada
(EDC), a corporation wholly-owned by the government of Canada;



•Improving the quality of our cars and trucks, while increasing customer satisfaction and overall perception of our products; and



•Continuing to take a leadership role in the development of advanced energy saving technologies, including advanced combustion engines, biofuels, fuel
cells, hybrid vehicles, extended-range-electric vehicles, and advanced battery development.







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



General

We develop, produce and market cars, trucks and parts worldwide. We do so through our three segments: General Motors North America (GMNA),
General Motors Europe (GME) and General Motors International Operations (GMIO).

In the year ended 2009 vehicle sales, market
share data and production volume combine our data in the period July 10, 2009 through December 31, 2009 with Old GM’s data in the period January 1, 2009 through July 9, 2009 for comparative purposes.

Total combined GM and Old GM worldwide vehicle sales in the year ended 2009 were 7.5 million. Old GM’s total worldwide vehicle sales
were 8.4 million and 9.4 million in the years ended 2008 and 2007. Substantially all of the cars, trucks and parts are marketed through retail dealers in North America, and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the
substantial majority of which are independently owned. GMNA primarily meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the following core brands:



•    Buick•    Cadillac•    Chevrolet•    GMC

The demands of customers outside North America are primarily met with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the following brands:



•    Buick•    Daewoo•    Holden•    Opel•    Cadillac•    GMC•    Isuzu•    Vauxhall•    Chevrolet

At December 31, 2009 we had equity ownership stakes directly or indirectly through various
regional subsidiaries, including GM Daewoo Auto & Technology Co. (GM Daewoo), Shanghai General Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM), SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SGMW), and FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (FAW-GM). These companies
design, manufacture and market vehicles under the following brands:



•    Buick•    Daewoo•    GMC•    Jiefang•    Cadillac•    FAW•    Holden•    Wuling•    Chevrolet

In addition to the products we sell to our dealers for consumer retail sales, we also sell cars and
trucks to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Sales to fleet customers are completed through our network of dealers and in some cases directly by us. Our retail and
fleet customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.

Brand Rationalization

We
have focused our resources in the U.S. on four core brands: Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC. As a result, we have sold our Saab brand and announced plans to phase out our Pontiac, Saturn and HUMMER brands. In connection with the rationalization
of our brands, there is no planned investment for Pontiac, and the brand is expected to be phased out by the end of 2010.

Saturn

In September 2009 we decided to wind-down the Saturn brand and dealership network in accordance
with the deferred termination agreements that Saturn dealers have signed with us. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Brand Rationalization” for a further discussion
on the Saturn disposition.

HUMMER

In February 2010 we announced that Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Co., Ltd. (Tengzhong), was unable to complete the acquisition of
HUMMER and that we would proceed to wind down the HUMMER brand. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Brand Rationalization” for a further discussion on the HUMMER
disposition.

Saab

In February 2010 we completed the sale of Saab to Spyker Cars NV. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Brand
Rationalization” for a further discussion on the Saab disposition.

Opel/Vauxhall Restructuring Activities

In February 2010 we presented our plan for the long-term viability of our Opel/Vauxhall operations to the German government. Our plan
includes specific capital requirements, restructuring initiatives, estimated 12 product launches in the next two years and emphasis on alternative propulsion technologies. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations — Opel/Vauxhall Restructuring Activities” for a further discussion on the Opel/Vauxhall operations long-term viability plan.

Fleet Sales and Deliveries

The sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales. Fleet sales are comprised of vehicle sales
to daily rental car companies, as well as leasing companies and commercial fleet and government customers. Certain fleet transactions, particularly daily rental, are generally less profitable than retail sales. As part of our pricing strategy,
particularly in the U.S., we have improved our mix of sales to specific customers.

The following table summarizes estimated
fleet sales and the amount of those sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):

Competitive Position

The global automotive industry is highly competitive. The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences
in the markets in which we operate include price, quality, available options, style, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.

In the year ended 2009 combined GM and Old GM estimated worldwide market share was 11.6%. In 2009 the U.S. continued to be negatively
affected by the economic factors experienced in 2008 as U.S. automotive industry sales declined 21.4% when compared to 2008. Despite this U.S. industry sales decline and the fact that the market share decreased from Old GM 2008 levels of 22.1%,
combined GM and Old GM estimated U.S. market share of 19.6% was the highest among GM and Old GM’s principal competitors.

Old GM’s estimated worldwide market share was 12.4% and 13.2% in the years ended 2008 and 2007. In 2008 worldwide market share was severely affected by the recession in Old GM’s largest market, the U.S., and the recession in
Western Europe. Tightening of the credit markets, increases in the unemployment rate, declining consumer confidence as a result of declining household incomes and







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



escalating public speculation related to Old GM’s potential bankruptcy contributed to significantly lower vehicle sales in the U.S. These economic factors had a negative effect on the U.S.
automotive industry and the principal factors that determine consumers’ vehicle buying decisions. As a result, consumers delayed purchasing or leasing new vehicles which caused a decline in U.S. vehicle sales.

The following table summarizes the respective U.S. market shares in passenger cars and trucks:

data in the period January 1, 2009 through July 9, 2009 for comparative purposes. Market share data in the years ended 2008 and 2007 relate to Old GM.

Product Pricing

A number of methods are used to promote our products,
including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand
for our products. In 2010, we will continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required. We believe this strategy coupled with improved inventory management will continue to strengthen the
reputation of our brands and continue to improve our average transaction price.

Cyclical Nature of Business

In the automotive industry, retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout
the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles is cyclical and depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending. In 2009 the global automotive industry, particularly in the U.S., had not yet
recovered from the negative economic factors experienced in 2008 and has continued to experience decreases in the total number of new cars and trucks sold and decreased production volume.

Relationship with Dealers

Worldwide we market vehicles through a network of independent retail dealers and distributors. At December 31, 2009 there were 5,619 vehicle dealers in the U.S., 568 in Canada and 263 in Mexico. Additionally, there were a total of
14,317 distribution outlets throughout the rest of the world. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets.

The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



As part of achieving and sustaining long-term viability and the
viability of our dealer network, we determined that a reduction in the number of GMNA dealerships was necessary. In determining which dealerships would remain in our network we performed analyses of volumes and consumer satisfaction indexes, among
other criteria. Refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — U.S. Dealer Reduction” for a further discussion on our plan to reduce U.S. dealerships.

We enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices
and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from a GM approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand of vehicle at a single dealership. In fact, we actively promote this for several of our brands
in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized GM dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell, using genuine GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are
authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program, and those repairs are to be made only with genuine GM parts. In addition, our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and
extended service contracts provided by GMAC Inc. (GMAC) or its subsidiaries and other financial institutions.

Because dealers
maintain the primary sales and service interface with the ultimate consumer of our products, the quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success. In addition to the terms of our contracts
with our dealers, we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for
cause and other contractual matters.

Research, Development and Intellectual Property

Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering, and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new
products or services or improving existing products or services, including activities related to vehicle emissions control, improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers.

Research

Overview

Our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy, as energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business
strategy. Our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption. To meet this objective we focus on five specific areas:



•Continue to increase the fuel efficiency of our cars and trucks;



•Development of alternative fuel vehicles;



•Invest significantly in our hybrid and electric technologies;



•Invest significantly in plug-in electric vehicle technology; and



•Continued development of hydrogen fuel cell technology.







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



Fuel Efficiency

We and Old GM have complied with federal fuel economy requirements since their inception in 1978, and we are fully
committed to meeting the requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and compliance with other regulatory schemes, including the California CO2program. We anticipate steadily improving fuel economy for both our car and truck fleets. We are committed to meeting or
exceeding all federal fuel economy standards in the 2010 through 2015 model years. We plan to achieve compliance through a combination of strategies, including: (1) extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains;
(2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and six speed automatic transmissions; (3) vehicle improvements, including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures; (4) increased hybrid offerings and the launch of
the Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle with extended range in 2010; and (5) portfolio changes, including the increasing car/crossover mix and dropping select larger vehicles in favor of smaller, more fuel efficient offerings.

We are among the industry leaders in fuel efficiency and we are committed to lead in the development of technologies to increase the fuel
efficiency of internal combustion engines such as cylinder deactivation, direct injection, turbo-charging with engine downsizing, six speed transmissions and variable valve timing. As a full-line manufacturer that produces a wide variety of cars,
trucks and sport utility vehicles, we currently offer 20 models obtaining 30 mpg or more in highway driving, more than any other manufacturer.

Alternative Fuel Vehicles

We have also been in the forefront in the
development of alternative fuel vehicles, leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our operations in Brazil. Alternative fuels offer the greatest near-term potential to reduce petroleum consumption in the
transportation sector, especially as cellulosic sources of ethanol become more affordable and readily available in the U.S. An increasing percentage of our sales will be alternative fuel capable vehicles, estimated to increase from 17% in 2010 to
65% in 2014.

As part of an overall energy diversity strategy, we remain committed to making at least 50% of the vehicles we
produce for the U.S. capable of operating on biofuels, specifically E85 ethanol, by 2012. We currently offer 17 FlexFuel models capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two.

We are focused on promoting sustainable biofuels derived from non-food sources, such as agricultural, forestry and municipal waste. We are
continuing to work with our two strategic alliances with cellulosic ethanol makers Coskata, Inc., of Warrenville, Illinois, and New Hampshire based Mascoma Corp. In October 2009 Coskata, Inc. opened its semi-commercial facility for manufacturing
cellulosic ethanol and Mascoma Corp. has been making cellulosic ethanol at its Rome, New York, demonstration plant since late 2008.

We are also supporting the development of biodiesel, a clean-burning alternative diesel fuel that is produced from renewable sources. We currently approve the use of B5, which are certified biodiesel blends of up to 5%, in our Duramax
engine that we sell in the U.S. This engine is available on the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra heavy-duty pick-up trucks, Chevrolet Express and GMC Savanna fullsize vans and the Chevrolet Kodiak and GMC Top Kick commercial vehicles. B5 is also
approved for all GM diesels in Europe and Asia. We offer a special equipment option on the 6.6-liter Duramax for B20, a 20% biodiesel blend. The special equipment option is available on certain configurations of the GMC Savanna and Chevrolet Express
Vans and the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Heavy-Duty One-Ton Pick-ups. For the 2011 model year, B20 capability will be available on our 6.6L turbo diesel engine.

Hybrid and Plug-In Electric Vehicles

We are also investing significantly
in vehicle electrification including hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles with extended-range technology. We currently offer seven hybrid models. We are also developing plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology (PHEV) and the Chevrolet Volt
and Opel Ampera electric vehicles with extended range. We plan to invest heavily between 2010 and 2012 to support the expansion of our electrified vehicle offering and in-house development and manufacturing capabilities of the enabling
technologies-advanced batteries, electric motors and power control systems.







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



We have multiple technologies offering increasing levels of
vehicle electrification — hybrid, plug-in hybrid and electric vehicle with extended range.

The highly capable GM
Two-mode Hybrid system is offered with the automotive industry’s only hybrid fullsize trucks and sport utility vehicles: Chevrolet Tahoe, Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Yukon and Yukon Denali, GMC Sierra, Cadillac Escalade and Escalade Platinum.

A PHEV, using a modified version of GM’s Two-Mode Hybrid system and advanced lithium-ion battery technology, is
scheduled to launch in 2012. The PHEV will provide low-speed electric-only propulsion, and blend engine and battery power to significantly improve fuel efficiency.

We have also announced that we plan to launch the Chevrolet Volt electric vehicle with extended range in late 2010. The Chevrolet Volt is powered by electricity at all times and at all speeds. The
Chevrolet Volt is designed to operate on battery power alone for up to 40 miles, after which an engine-generator will provide the electricity to power the electric drive unit. Advanced lithium-ion battery technology is the key enabling technology
for the Chevrolet Volt. In January 2009 Old GM announced that it would assemble the battery packs for the Chevrolet Volt in the U.S. using cells supplied by LG Chem. Battery production began at our Brownstown Battery facility in January 2010. A
second electric vehicle with extended range, the Opel Ampera, is under development and scheduled to launch in Europe in late 2011.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology

OnStar

Advancements in telematics technology are demonstrated through our OnStar service. OnStar’s in-vehicle safety, security and communications service is the automotive industry’s leading telematics provider, available on more than 30
of our 2010 model year vehicles and currently serving approximately 5.5 million subscribers. OnStar’s key services include: Automatic Crash Response, Stolen Vehicle Assistance, Turn-by-Turn Navigation, OnStar Vehicle Diagnostics and
Hands-Free Calling. In May 2009 OnStar announced the development of an Injury Severity Prediction based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel. This will allow OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a
vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. Data from OnStar’s Automatic Crash Response system will be used to automatically calculate the Injury Severity Prediction which can assist responders in determining the
level of care required and the transport destination for patients. OnStar has







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



also expanded its Stolen Vehicle Assistance services with the announcement of Remote Ignition Block. This will allow an OnStar Advisor to send a remote signal to a subscriber’s stolen
vehicle to prevent the vehicle from restarting once the ignition is turned off. This capability will not only help authorities recover stolen vehicles, but can also prevent or shorten dangerous high speed pursuits.

Other Technologies

Other safety systems include the third generation of our StabiliTrak electronic stability control system. In addition to controlling brakes and reducing engine power, the latest iteration of the system combines active front steering to turn
the front wheels into the skid when the rear wheels lose traction. Our Lane Departure Warning System and Side Blind Zone Alert System extend and enhance driver awareness and vision.

Refer to “Environmental and Regulatory Matters” for a discussion of vehicle emissions requirements, vehicle noise requirements,
fuel economy requirements and safety requirements, which also affect our research and development activities.

Product
Development

Our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization. This strategy built
on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development.

For example, in the 1990s Old GM
merged 11 different engineering centers in the U.S. into a single organization. In 2005, GM Europe Engineering was created, following a similar consolidation from three separate engineering organizations. At the same time, we and Old GM have grown
our engineering operations in emerging markets in the Asia Pacific and Latin America/Africa/Middle East (LAAM) regions.

As a
result of this process, product development activities are fully integrated on a global basis under one budget and one decision-making group. Similar approaches have been in place for a number of years in other key functions, such as powertrain,
purchasing and manufacturing, to take full advantage of our global footprint and resources.

Under our global vehicle
architecture strategy and for each of our nine global architectures, we define a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces.

A centralized organization is responsible for many of the non-visible parts of the vehicle, referred to as the architecture, such as
steering, suspension, the brake system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system. This team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world, who are responsible for components
that are unique to each brand, such as exterior and interior design, tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements.

We currently have nine different global architectures that are assigned to regional centers around the world. The allocation of the
architectures to specific regions is based on where the expertise for the vehicle segment resides, e.g., mini and small vehicles in Asia Pacific, compact vehicles in Europe and fullsize pick-up trucks, sport utility vehicles, midsize vehicles and
crossover vehicles in North America.

The nine global architectures are:



•    Mini•    Rear-Wheel Drive and Performance•    Small•    Crossover•    Compact•    Midsize Truck•    Full and Midsize•    Electric•    Fullsize Truck

Intellectual Property

We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none
of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. In addition, we hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to
our identity and recognition in the marketplace.

Raw Materials, Services and Supplies

We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for
use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials are primarily comprised of steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry
substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements. In 2009 the weakening of commodity prices experienced in the latter part of 2008 was generally reversed, with prices returning
to more historical levels in the year ended 2009 and having the effect of increasing our costs. In a gradually recovering global economic climate, this shift is believed to be the result of speculative activity and the weakening of the
U.S. Dollar combined with increased confidence and mild improvements in underlying demand.

In some instances, we
purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source, and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Based on our standard payment terms with our systems, components and parts suppliers, we are generally required to pay
most of these suppliers on average 47 days following delivery with weekly disbursements.

Environmental and Regulatory Matters

Automotive Emissions Control

We are subject to laws and regulations, regarding vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic system (OBD) requirements, in the regions throughout the
world in which we sell cars, trucks and heavy-duty engines.

North America

The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S., and additional requirements are
imposed by various state governments, most notably California. These requirements include pre-production testing of vehicles, testing of vehicles after assembly, the imposition of emission defect and performance warranties and the obligation to
recall and repair customer owned vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements. We must obtain certification that the vehicles will meet emission requirements from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in
the U.S. and Canada and from the CARB before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements.

The EPA and the CARB continue to emphasize testing on vehicles sold in the U.S. for compliance. We believe that our vehicles meet currently applicable EPA and CARB requirements. If our vehicles do not
comply with the emission standards or if defective emission control systems or components are discovered in such testing, or as part of government required defect reporting, we could incur substantial costs related to emissions recalls. We expect
that new CARB and federal requirements will increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle’s emission performance.

The EPA and the CARB emission requirements currently in place are referred to as Tier 2 and Low Emission Vehicle (LEV) II. The Tier 2 requirements began in 2004 and were fully phased-in by the 2009 model
year, while the LEV II requirements began in 2004 and increase in stringency each year through the 2010 model year. Fleet-wide compliance with the Tier 2 and LEV II standards must be achieved based on a sales-weighted fleet average. CARB is
developing its next generation emission standards, LEV III,







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



which will further increase the stringency of its emission standards. Based on discussions with the CARB staff, we expect the LEV III requirements to be adopted in the second half of 2010 and to
apply beginning in the 2014 model year. California has also passed legislation and enacted a regulation to control the emissions of greenhouse gases. Since we believe this regulation is effectively a form of fuel economy requirement, it is discussed
under “Automotive Fuel Economy.” In addition, both the CARB and the EPA have adopted more stringent standards applicable to heavy-duty trucks.

California law requires that a specified percentage of cars and certain light-duty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles (ZEV), such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.
This requirement started at 10% for the 2005 model year and increased in subsequent years. Manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial ZEV credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative
emission standards and have extended emission system warranties. An additional portion of the ZEV requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial ZEV requirements and incorporate advanced technology, such as a hybrid electric propulsion
system meeting specified criteria. We are complying with the ZEV requirements using a variety of means, including producing vehicles certified to the partial ZEV requirements. California recently adopted changes applicable to the 2012 and later
model years that allow an additional portion of the ZEV requirements to be met with PHEVs, including E-REV’s such as the Chevrolet Volt, that meet partial ZEV requirements and other specified criteria. CARB has also announced plans to adopt, in
the second half of 2010, 2015 model year and later requirements for ZEVs and PHEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions.

The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Ten states, including New
York, Massachusetts, Maine, Vermont, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Oregon and Washington, currently have these standards in effect. Maryland and New Mexico have adopted the California standards effective beginning in the 2011
model year and Arizona’s standards are effective beginning in the 2012 model year. Additional states could also adopt the California standards in the future.

In addition to the exhaust emission programs previously discussed, advanced OBD systems, used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems, have been required under federal and
California law since the 1996 model year. Problems detected by the OBD system have the potential of increasing warranty costs and the chance for recall. OBD requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission
standards, and new diagnostics are required. Beginning with the 2004 model year, California adopted more stringent OBD requirements, including new design requirements and corresponding enforcement procedures, and we have implemented hardware and
software changes to comply with these more stringent requirements. In addition, California adopted technically challenging new OBD requirements that take effect from the 2008 through 2013 model years.

The federal Tier 2 and California evaporative emission LEV II requirements began phasing-in with the 2004 model year. The federal
requirements are being harmonized with the California requirements beginning with a 2009 model year phase-in. California plans to further increase the stringency of its requirements as part of its LEV III rulemaking.

Europe

In
Europe emissions are regulated by two different entities: the European Union (EU) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN ECE). The EU imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 EU Member States, and
other countries apply regulations under the framework of the UN ECE. EU member states can give tax incentives to automobile manufacturers for vehicles which meet emission standards earlier than the compliance date. This can result in specific market
requirements for automobile manufacturers to introduce technology earlier than is required for compliance with the EU emission standards. The current EU requirements include type approval of preproduction testing of vehicles, testing of vehicles
after assembly and the obligation to recall and repair customer owned vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements. EU and UN ECE requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation. We must demonstrate that vehicles
will meet emission requirements in witness tests and obtain type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the EU.

Emission requirements in Europe will become even more stringent in the future. A new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 5 standards, were applied in September 2009,
while stricter Euro 6 standards are expected to apply beginning in 2014. The OBD requirements associated with these new standards will become more challenging as well. The new







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



European emission standards focus particularly on reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. Diesel vehicles have become important in the European marketplace, where they encompass 50% of the
market share. The new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines. To comply with Euro 6, we expect that technologies need to be implemented which
are identical to those being developed to meet U.S. emission standards. The technologies available today are not cost effective and would therefore not be suitable for the European market for small and midsize diesel vehicles, which typically are
under high cost pressure. Further, measures to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions have detrimental effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy.

In the long-term, notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in Europe, regulatory discussions in Europe are expected to continue.
Regulators will continue to refine the testing requirements addressing issues such as test cycle, durability, OBD, in-service conformity and off-cycle emissions.

International Operations

Within the LAAM region, some countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and some follow the EU test procedures, standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. In terms of standards, Brazil
implemented national LEV standards, L5, which preceded Tier 2 standards in the U.S., for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in January 2009. Brazil has published new emission standards, L6, which are based on Euro 5 standards, for light
diesel and gasoline vehicles. L6 standards for light diesel vehicles are to be implemented in January 2013, which mandate OBD requirements for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in January
2014 for new types and January 2015 for all models. Argentina implemented Euro 4 standards starting with new vehicle registrations in January 2009 and is moving to Euro 5 standards in January 2012 for new vehicle types and January 2014 for all
models. Chile currently requires Euro 3 standards for gasoline vehicles and Euro 4 standards for diesel vehicles and has proposed Euro 4 standards for gasoline vehicles beginning in September 2010 and Euro 5 standards for diesel vehicles beginning
in September 2011. Other countries in the LAAM region either have some level of U.S. or EU standards or no standards at all.

Industrial Environmental Control

Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental
protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental cleanup. In connection with the 363 Sale we have assumed various stages of investigation for sites where contamination has been
alleged and a number of remediation actions to clean up hazardous wastes as required by federal and state laws. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original
disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability, as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



The future effect of environmental matters, including potential
liabilities, is often difficult to estimate. Environmental reserves are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. This practice is followed whether the claims are
asserted or unasserted. The amounts of current reserves are expected to be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, which typically range from two to 30 years.

The following table summarizes the expenses for site remediation actions, including ongoing operations and maintenance (dollars in
millions):



SuccessorPredecessorJuly 10, 2009ThroughDecember 31, 2009January 1, 2009ThroughJuly 9, 2009Year EndedDecember 31, 2008Year EndedDecember 31, 2007Site remediation expenses$3$34$94$104

It is possible that
such remediation actions could require average annual expenditures of $30 million over the next five years.

Remediation costs
and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible are not reasonably estimable because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials located at the site, the involvement of other potentially
responsible parties, the application of laws and other standards or regulations, site conditions and the nature and scope of investigations, studies and remediation to be undertaken (including the technologies to be required and the extent, duration
and success of remediation). As a result, we are unable to determine or reasonably estimate the amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with these sites, although that total could be substantial.

To mitigate the effects our worldwide facilities have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide
facilities as possible to landfill-free facilities. Landfill-free facilities send no waste to landfills, waste is either recycled or used to create energy. As part of Old GM’s commitment to reduce the effect its worldwide facilities had on the
environment, Old GM had committed to convert half of its major global manufacturing operations to landfill-free facilities by 2010. This landfill-free strategy translated, on an individual facility basis, to more than 70 of Old GM’s
manufacturing operations worldwide. At July 10, 2009 we had acquired, in connection with the 363 Sale, 56 landfill-free manufacturing facilities worldwide. At our landfill-free facilities, 97% of waste materials are recycled or reused and 3% is
converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. We estimate that over 2 million tons of waste materials were recycled or reused by us and Old GM in 2009 and estimate that 41,000 tons of waste materials from us and Old GM in 2009 were
converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. These numbers will increase as additional manufacturing sites reach landfill-free status.

We currently have not announced publicly any future targets to reduce CO2emission levels from our worldwide facilities; however, we are continuing to make significant progress in further reducing CO2emission levels. Seven of our facilities in Europe are included in and comply with the European Emissions Trading Scheme,
which is being implemented to meet the European Community’s greenhouse gas reduction commitments under the Kyoto Protocol. We and Old GM reported in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative, the Carbon Disclosure Project, the EPA Climate
Leaders Program and the Department of Energy (DOE) 1605(b) program since their inception. We are implementing and publicly reporting on various voluntary initiatives to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions from our worldwide
operations. In 2005 Old GM had a 2010 target of an 8% reduction in CO2emissions from its worldwide facilities compared to Old GM’s worldwide facilities 2005 emission levels. By 2008 Old GM had exceeded this target by reducing CO2emissions from its worldwide facilities by 20% compared to 2005 levels.

Automotive Fuel Economy

North America

The 1975 Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA) provided
for average fuel economy requirements for fleets of passenger cars built for the 1978 model year and thereafter. For the 2009 model year, our and Old GM’s domestic passenger car fleet achieved a Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) of 31.1
mpg, which exceeded the standard of 27.5 mpg. The estimated CAFE for our 2010 model year domestic passenger cars is 30.3 mpg, which would also exceed the 27.5 mpg standard applicable for that model year.







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



Cars that are imported for sale in the U.S. are accounted for
separately. For our and Old GM’s imported passenger cars, the 2009 model year CAFE was 30.3 mpg, which exceeded the requirement of 27.5 mpg. The estimated CAFE for our 2010 model year imported passenger cars is 34.5 mpg, which would
also exceed the applicable requirement.

Fuel economy standards for light-duty trucks became effective in 1979. Starting with
the 2008 model year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) implemented substantial changes to the structure of the truck CAFE program, including reformed standards based upon truck size. Under the existing truck rules, reformed
standards are optional for the 2008 through 2010 model years. Old GM chose to comply with these optional reform-based standards beginning with the 2008 model year. Our and Old GM’s light-duty truck CAFE performance for the 2009 model year was
23.7 mpg, which exceeds our and Old GM’s reformed requirement of 22.5 mpg. Our projected reform standard for light-duty trucks for the 2010 model year is 22.9 mpg and our projected performance under this standard is 23.7 mpg.

In 2007 Congress passed the Energy Independence and Security Act, which directed NHTSA to modify the CAFE program. Among the provisions in
the new law was a requirement that fuel economy standards continue to be set separately for cars and trucks that combined would increase to at least 35.0 mpg by 2020.

In addition, California has passed legislation (AB 1493) requiring the CARB to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles (which is the
same as regulating fuel economy). This California program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years. California needed a federal waiver to implement this program and was granted this waiver on June 30, 2009.

Further, in response to a U.S. Supreme Court decision, the EPA was directed to establish a new program to regulate greenhouse gas emissions
for vehicles under the Clean Air Act. As a result, in September 2009 the EPA and the NHTSA issued a joint proposal to establish a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for model year 2012 through 2016 light-duty vehicles that
will reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act and improve fuel economy pursuant to the CAFE standards under the EPCA. These reform-based standards will apply to passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty passenger vehicles
(collectively, light-duty vehicles) built in model years 2012 through 2016. The rule is to be finalized by April 2010. Our current product plan projects compliance with the federal and California programs through 2016.

CARB has agreed that compliance with the EPA’s greenhouse gas emission standards will be deemed compliant with the
AB 1493 standards for 2012 through 2016 model years. In the meantime, California’s program to regulate vehicle greenhouse gases is in effect for the 2009-2011 model years. The following table illustrates California’s program compliance
standards and our projected compliance (in grams per mile CO2-equivalent):

(a)Our performance projections for the 2010 model year for the passenger car and light-duty truck 1 fleet as well as both fleets for the 2011 model year are projected to
be more than the standard. We are still projecting compliance due to the allowed use of credits earned in previous years.

Europe

In Europe, the EU passed legislation in
December 2008 to regulate CO2emissions beginning in 2012.
Based on a target function of CO2to vehicle weight, each
manufacturer must meet a specific target based on the CO2target value on this curve for each vehicle it sells, but with the ability to average across its fleet in each year. This requirement will be phased in with 65% of vehicles sold in 2012 required to meet this target, 75% in 2013, 80% in 2014 and 100%
in 2015 and beyond. Automobile manufacturers can earn super-credits under this legislation for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific CO2value of less than 50 grams CO2. This is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultra-low CO2vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel/Vauxhall Ampera by providing an







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



additional incentive to reduce the CO2fleet average. Automobile manufacturers may gain credit of up to 7 grams for eco-innovations for those technologies which improve real-world fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle, such as solar
panels on vehicles. There is also a 5% credit for E85 flexible-fuel vehicles if more than 30% of refueling stations in an EU member state sell E85. Further regulatory detail is being developed in the comitology process, which develops the detail of
the regulatory requirements through a process involving the European Commission and member states. The legislation sets a target of 95 grams per kilometer CO2for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement. We have developed a compliance
plan by adopting operational CO2targets for each market
entry in Europe.

In October 2009 the EU Commission adopted a proposal to regulate CO2emissions from light commercial vehicles. The proposal is modeled after
the CO2regulation for passenger cars. It proposes that new
light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average CO2target of
175 grams per kilometer CO2with a phase-in of compliance
beginning with 75% of new light commercial vehicles by 2014, 80% by 2015 and 100% compliance by 2016. The manufacturer-specific CO2compliance target will be determined as a function of vehicle curb mass. Flexibilities, such as eco-innovations and super
credits, are part of the regulatory proposal as well. A long-term target for 2020 of 135g/km has been also proposed, to be confirmed after an impact assessment in 2013. We are currently making an assessment of the effect of the proposal on our fleet
of light commercial vehicles. The EU Commission’s proposal will now go through the legislative process with the European Parliament and European Council, during which we expect some modifications to be adopted.

A regulation has been adopted that will require low-rolling resistance tires, tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators by
2012. An additional regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise, fuel efficiency and rolling resistance, affecting vehicles at sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket. Further, there are plans to introduce
regulatory proposals regarding energy efficiency of air conditioning systems and fuel economy meters.

Sixteen EU member states have introduced CO2based
vehicle taxation schemes. Tax measures are within the jurisdiction of the EU member states. We are faced with significant challenges relative to the predictability of future tax laws and differences in the tax schemes and thresholds.

International Operations

In the Asia Pacific region, we face new or increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards. In China, Phase 3 fuel economy standards are under development and may move from a vehicle pass-fail system
to a corporate fleet average scheme. Phase 3 fuel economy standards are expected to increase by 15% to 20% from the current Phase 2 targets and implementation is expected to begin in 2012. Phase 2 currently allows some relief for certain vehicle
types and vehicles with automatic transmissions. It is unclear at this time if that relief will be carried over in Phase 3. In Korea, new fuel economy/CO


targets were announced last year as part of the government’s low carbon/green growth strategy. These targets are
planned to be set at levels more stringent than fuel economy/CO


targets in the U.S., but less stringent than fuel economy/CO


targets in Europe. Phase-in is expected to begin in 2012 and finish in 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify either on a fuel consumption basis or a CO


emissions basis. Each manufacturer will be given a corporate target to meet based on an overall industry fleet fuel
economy/CO


average. Other aspects of the program being
considered include credits, incentives, and penalties. Legislation of the new standard is expected to be completed by the end of 2010. In Australia the government is conducting an assessment of possible vehicle fuel efficiency measures including
shifting from voluntary to mandatory standards and how any such move would align with the government’s policy response to climate change. Before the government makes any decisions on additional fuel efficiency measures, it will conduct an
industry consultation. For the first time, India is expected to establish fuel economy norms based on weight and measured in CO


emissions that will become mandatory sometime in 2011. Final targets and labeling requirements are still to be determined.
In April 2009 automobile manufacturers in India began to voluntarily declare the fuel economy of each vehicle at the point of sale.

In Brazil, governmental bodies and the Brazilian automobile makers association established, in 2009, a national voluntary program for evaluation and labeling of light passenger and commercial vehicles equipped with internal combustion
engines. This voluntary program aims to increase vehicles energy efficiency by labeling vehicles with fuel consumption measurements for urban, extra-urban and combined (equivalent to city and highway mpg measurements in the U.S.) driving conditions.
We are and Old GM was engaged in this program along with other leading car manufacturers.

Chemical Regulations

North America

Several states have introduced legislation related to green chemistry and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives would give states broad regulatory authority in relation to the use of certain chemical substances and potentially
affect a manufacturer’s vehicle life-cycle responsibilities. For example, we expect California’s Green Chemistry regulations to be finalized at the end of 2010. Currently, vehicles are not included in the scope of the regulations; however,
if vehicles are included in future revised regulations it could lead to increased product complexity and cost.

Europe

In June 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical
substances (REACH). The regulation deals with chemical substances produced with a production volume of one ton or more per year are required to be registered with a new European Chemicals Agency. During REACH’s pre-registration phase, Old GM
and our suppliers registered those substances identified by the regulation. REACH is to be phased in over a 10 year period from the implementation date. During the implementation phase, REACH will require ongoing action from us, Original Equipment
Manufacturers (OEM), our suppliers and other suppliers in the supply chain. Under REACH, substances of very high concern may require authorization for further use and may also be restricted in the future, which could increase the cost of certain
substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts. In addition, our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future REACH requirements. We are continually monitoring the implementation of REACH and its effect on our
suppliers and the automotive industry to maintain compliance.

Safety

New vehicles and equipment sold in the U.S. are required to meet certain safety standards promulgated by the NHTSA. The National Traffic and
Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 authorized the NHTSA to determine these standards and the schedule for implementing them. In addition, in the case of a vehicle defect that creates an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety or does not comply with
a safety standard, the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 generally requires that the manufacturer notify owners and provide a remedy. The Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act requires us to
report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and lawsuits in the U.S. and fatalities and recalls outside the U.S.

We are subject to certain safety standards and recall regulations in the markets outside the U.S. in which we operate. These standards often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards, but may differ in
their requirements and test procedures. From time to time, other countries pass regulations which are more stringent than U.S. standards. Most countries require type approval while the U.S. and Canada require self-certification.

Vehicular Noise Control

Vehicles we manufacture and sell may be subject to noise emission regulations.

In the U.S., passenger cars and light-duty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations. We are committed to designing and developing our products to meet these noise regulations. Since addressing different vehicle
noise regulations established in numerous state and local jurisdictions is not practical, we attempt to identify the most stringent requirements and validate to those requirements. In the rare instances where a state or local noise regulation is not
covered by the composite requirement, a waiver of the requirement is requested and to date no significant cost has resulted from such a request. Medium to heavy-duty trucks are regulated at the federal level. Federal truck regulations preempt all
United States state or local noise regulations for trucks over 10,000 lbs. gross vehicle weight rating.







GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



Outside the U.S., noise regulations have been established by
authorities at the national and supranational level (e.g., EU or UN ECE for Europe). We believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold.

While current noise emission regulations serve to regulate maximum allowable noise levels, proposals have been made to regulate minimum
noise levels. These proposals stem from concern that vehicles that are relatively quiet, specifically hybrids, may not be heard by the sight-impaired. We are committed to design and manufacture vehicles to comply with potential noise emission
regulations that may come from these proposals.

Potential Effect of Regulations

We have established aggressive near-term and long-term plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce
emissions, mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities, improve fuel efficiency, monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers. This is illustrated by our
commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles, our accelerated commitment to develop electrically powered vehicles, our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of flexible-fuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine
technology have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles. In addition, the conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfill-free status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability. We believe that
the development and global implementation of new, cost-effective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities.

Despite these advanced technology efforts, our ability to satisfy fuel economy and CO2requirements is contingent on various future economic, consumer,
legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control and cannot predict with certainty. If we are not able to comply with specific new fuel economy requirements, which include higher CAFE standards and state CO2requirements such as those imposed by the AB 1493 Rules, then we could
be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. Environmental liabilities, which we may be responsible for, are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. In addition,
violations of safety standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products. In turn, any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations, including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss
of revenue.

Pension Legislation

We are subject to a variety of federal rules and regulations, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) and the Pension Protection Act of 2006, which govern the
manner in which we fund and administer our pensions for our retired employees and their spouses. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 is designed, among other things, to more appropriately reflect the value of pension assets and liabilities to
determine funding requirements. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 we expect there will be no cash funding requirement for our U.S. hourly and salaried pension plans in 2010. We remeasure our U.S. pension plans at the end of each year and for
significant plan amendments, benefit modifications and related events. Based on preliminary asset returns, the year-to-date discount rate, assuming interest rates remain at current levels and pension fund assets earn 8.5% annually going forward, we
may need to make significant contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2013 and beyond. We are currently analyzing our pension funding strategies. We also maintain pension plans for employees in a number of countries outside the U.S., which are
subject to local laws and regulations.

Export Control

We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations, including those administered by the U.S. Departments of State, Commerce, and Treasury. In addition, most countries in which we do business have
applicable export controls. Our Office of Export Compliance and global Export Compliance Officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Non-U.S. export controls are likely to become
increasingly significant to our business as we develop our research and development operations on a global basis. If we fail to comply with applicable export compliance regulations, we and our employees could be subject to criminal and civil
penalties and, under certain circumstances, loss of export privileges and debarment from doing business with the U.S. government and the governments of other countries.

Significant Transactions

On July 10, 2009 we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Old GM and its
direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Sellers). The 363 Sale was consummated in accordance with the Amended and Restated Master Sale and Purchase Agreement, dated June 26, 2009, as amended, (Purchase Agreement) between us and the
Sellers, and pursuant to the Bankruptcy Court’s sale order dated July 5, 2009.

In connection with the 363 Sale, the
purchase price we paid to Old GM equaled the sum of:



•A credit bid in an amount equal to the total of: (1) debt of $19.8 billion under Old GM’s UST Loan Agreement, plus notes of $1.2
billion issued as additional compensation for the UST Loan Agreement, plus interest on such debt Old GM owed as of the closing date of the 363 Sale; and (2) debt of $33.3 billion under Old GM’s DIP Facility, plus notes of $2.2 billion
issued as additional compensation for the DIP Facility, plus interest Old GM owed as of the closing date, less debt of $8.2 billion owed under the DIP Facility;



•The UST’s return of the warrants Old GM previously issued to it;



•The issuance to MLC of 50 million shares (or 10%) of our common stock and warrants to acquire newly issued shares of our common stock
initially exercisable for a total of 91 million shares of our common stock (or 15% on a fully diluted basis); and



•Our assumption of certain specified liabilities of Old GM (including debt of $7.1 billion owed under the DIP Facility).

Under the Purchase Agreement, we are obligated to issue additional shares of our common stock to MLC
(Adjustment Shares) in the event that allowed general unsecured claims against MLC, as estimated by the Bankruptcy Court, exceed $35.0 billion. The maximum Adjustment Shares equate to 2% (or 10 million shares) of our common stock. The number of
Adjustment Shares to be issued is calculated based on the extent to which estimated general unsecured claims exceed $35.0 billion with the maximum number of Adjustment Shares issued if estimated general unsecured claims total $42.0 billion or more.
We determined that it is probable that general unsecured claims allowed against MLC will ultimately exceed $35.0 billion by at least $2.0 billion. In that circumstance, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we would be required to issue
2.9 million Adjustment Shares to MLC as an adjustment to the purchase price.

At July 10, 2009 we accrued $113
million in Other liabilities and deferred income taxes related to this contingent obligation.

Agreements with the UST,
UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust and Export Development Canada

On July 10, 2009 we entered into the UST Credit
Agreement and assumed debt of $7.1 billion Old GM incurred under its DIP Facility. Immediately after entering into the UST Credit Agreement, we made a partial pre-payment, reducing the UST Loans principal balance to $6.7 billion. An amendment to the
UST Credit Agreement, as subsequently discussed, provides for quarterly payments of $1.0 billion beginning in December 2009. At March 31, 2010 the first two quarterly payments have been made reducing the UST Loans principal balance to $4.7
billion. We also entered into the VEBA Note Agreement and issued a note in the principal amount of $2.5 billion (VEBA Notes) to the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust (New VEBA).

We are required to prepay the UST Loans, VEBA Notes and Canadian Loan (as subsequently defined), in certain cases on a pro rata basis, in an
amount equal to the net cash proceeds received from certain asset dispositions, casualty events, extraordinary receipts and the incurrence of certain debt. We can voluntarily repay all or a portion of the UST Loans or VEBA Notes at any time. Once
repaid, we cannot reborrow under the UST Credit Agreement.

The obligations under the UST Credit Agreement and the VEBA Note
Agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets, subject to certain exceptions, including our equity interests in certain of our foreign subsidiaries, limited in most cases to 65% of the equity interests of the pledged foreign subsidiaries
due to tax considerations.

Proceeds of the DIP Facility of $16.4 billion were deposited in
escrow and will be distributed to us at our request if the following conditions are met: (1) the representations and warranties we made in the loan documents are true and correct in all material respects on the date of our request; (2) we
are not in default on the date of our request taking into consideration the amount of the withdrawal request; and (3) the UST, in its sole discretion, approves the amount and intended use of the requested disbursement. Any unused amounts in
escrow on June 30, 2010 are required to be used to repay the UST Loans and the Canadian Loan on a pro rata basis. Any proceeds remaining in the escrow account after the UST Loans and the Canadian Loan are repaid in full shall be returned to us.

On July 10, 2009 through our wholly-owned subsidiary General Motors of Canada Limited (GMCL), we also entered into the
amended and restated Canadian Loan Agreement with EDC, as a result of which GMCL has a CAD $1.5 billion (equivalent to $1.3 billion when entered into) term loan (Canadian Loan). An amendment to the UST Credit Agreement provides for quarterly
payments of $192 million beginning December 2009. At March 31, 2010 the first two quarterly payments had been made reducing the Canadian Loan principal balance to $1.0 billion.

GMCL may voluntarily repay the Canadian Loan in whole or in part at any time. Once repaid, GMCL cannot reborrow under the Canadian Loan
Agreement. We and 1908 Holdings Ltd., Parkwood Holdings Ltd., and GM Overseas Funding LLC, each of which is a Subsidiary Guarantor of GMCL, have guaranteed the Canadian Loan. Our guarantee of GMCL’s obligations under the Canadian Loan Agreement
is secured by a lien on the equity of GMCL. Because 65% of our ownership interest in GMCL was previously pledged to secure the obligations under the UST Credit Agreement and the VEBA Note Agreement, EDC received a first priority lien on 35% of our
equity interest in GMCL and a second priority lien on the remaining 65%. With certain exceptions, GMCL’s obligations under the Canadian Loan Agreement are secured by a first lien on substantially all of its and the Subsidiary Guarantors’
assets, including GMCL’s ownership interests in the Subsidiary Guarantors and a portion of GMCL’s equity interests in General Motors Product Services Inc., a subsidiary of ours.

In November 2009 we signed amendments to the UST Credit Agreement and the Canadian Loan Agreement to provide for quarterly repayments of the
UST Loans and Canadian Loan. Under these amendments, we agreed to make quarterly payments of $1.0 billion and $192 million to the UST and EDC, which began in the fourth quarter of 2009. Upon making such payments, equivalent amounts were
released to us from escrow. In the event of an initial public offering of our equity, this payment schedule would be suspended. The remaining terms would remain unchanged versus the original agreement. Any funds remaining in our escrow account after
repayment of the loans will be released to us.

Agreement with Delphi Corporation

In July 2009 we entered into the Delphi Master Disposition Agreement (DMDA) with Delphi Corporation (Delphi) and other parties. Under the
DMDA, we agreed to acquire Delphi’s global steering business (Nexteer), which supplies us and other OEMs with steering systems and columns, and four domestic facilities that manufacture a variety of automotive components, primarily sold to us.
We and several third party investors who held the Delphi Tranche DIP facilities (collectively the Investors) agreed to acquire substantially all of Delphi’s remaining assets through DIP HOLDCO, LLP, subsequently named Delphi Automotive LLP (New
Delphi). Certain excluded assets and liabilities have been retained by a Delphi entity (DPH) to be sold or liquidated. In October 2009 we consummated the transaction contemplated by the DMDA with Delphi, New Delphi, Old GM and other sellers and
other buyers that are party to the agreement, as more fully described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. Refer to “Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —
Strategic Initiatives — Delphi Master Disposition Agreement” for a description of the terms of the DMDA and related agreements.

Holding Company Merger

On October 19, 2009 we completed our
holding company merger to implement a new holding company structure that is intended to provide greater financial and organizational flexibility. In connection with the merger, all of the outstanding shares of common stock and Series A Preferred
Stock in our previous legal entity were exchanged on a one-for-one basis for new shares of our common stock and Series A Preferred Stock. These new securities have the same economic terms and provisions as the securities for which they were
exchanged and are held by our securityholders in the same class evidencing the same proportional interest in us as the securityholders held prior to the exchange.

In addition, in connection with the merger we entered into
amended and restated warrant agreements and a Stockholders Agreement dated as of October 15, 2009, which are substantially identical to our prior warrant agreements and Stockholders Agreement dated as of July 10, 2009, respectively. Also
in connection with the merger, GMCL entered into an amendment (Canadian Loan Amendment) to the Canadian Loan Agreement and we entered into an assignment and assumption agreement and amendment to the UST Credit Agreement and an assignment and
assumption agreement and amendment to the VEBA Note Agreement. Refer to “Market for the Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities — Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities”
for a further discussion on the merger.
