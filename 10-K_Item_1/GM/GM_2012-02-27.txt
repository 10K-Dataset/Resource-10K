Competitive Position



Information in this 2011 Form 10-K relating to our relative position in the global automotive industry is based upon the good faith estimates of management and includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Market share information in this 2011 Form 10-K is based on vehicle sales volume. Worldwide market share and vehicle sales data excludes the markets of Iran, North Korea, Sudan and Syria.



The global automotive industry is highly competitive. The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include price, quality, available options, style, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.



In the year ended December 31, 2011 our worldwide market share increased to11.9%. Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2011 reflect the moderate improvement in certain facets of the U.S. economy which has contributed to a slow but steady improvement in U.S. industry vehicle sales, as well as increased volumes in Russia and China.



In the year ended December 31, 2010 our worldwide market share was11.5%. Our vehicle sales volumes in the year ended December 31, 2010 were consistent with a gradual U.S. vehicle sales recovery from the negative economic effects of the U.S. recession first experienced by Old GM in the second half of 2008, as well as increased volumes in China.



In the year ended December 31, 2009 combined GM and Old GM worldwide market share was11.6%. In 2009 the U.S. and Europe continued to be negatively affected by the economic factors first experienced in 2008 as their automotive industry sales declined 21.4% and 14.5% when compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, although volumes increased in China.



Production volume includes vehicles produced by certain joint ventures. The joint venture agreements with SGMW and FAW-GM allow for significant rights as a member as well as the contractual right to report SGMW and FAW-GM joint venture production in China.

Product Pricing



Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. In 2012 we will continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required. We believe this strategy, coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices.



Cyclical Nature of Business



Retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending.



Relationship with Dealers



We market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets.



The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



December 31,201120102009GMNA5,0685,1676,450GME7,7457,8598,422GMIO6,9016,0535,784GMSA1,1621,1361,166Total worldwide20,87620,21521,822



We enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial, Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally Financial) and other financial institutions.



The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.



Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property



Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering, and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control, improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers.



The following table summarizes research and development expense (dollars in millions):

SuccessorPredecessorYear EndedDecember 31, 2011Year EndedDecember 31, 2010July 10, 2009ThroughDecember 31, 2009January 1, 2009ThroughJuly 9, 2009Research and development expense$8,124$6,962$3,034$3,017



Our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy. Our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption.



Fuel Efficiency



We are fully committed to meeting the requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA) and compliance with other regulatory schemes. We plan to achieve compliance through a combination of strategies including: (1) extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains; (2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions; (3) vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures; (4) increased hybrid and electric vehicle offerings; and (5) portfolio changes including increasing car/crossover mix and dropping select larger vehicles in favor of smaller, more fuel efficient offerings.



Alternative Fuel Vehicles



Alternative fuels offer the greatest near-term potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. Leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop Flex Fuel vehicles that can run on gasoline-ethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES





We currently offer 20 FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the 2012 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. We continue to study the future role FlexFuel vehicles may play in the U.S. in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure. In 2011 94% of vehicle sales in Brazil were FlexFuel vehicles capable of running on 100% ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in Australia, Thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace.



We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are clean-burning alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources, and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels.



We produce compressed natural gas capable vehicles in Europe such as the Opel Zafira, and in the U.S., the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans are offered to fleet and commercial customers. We offer LPG capable vehicles in select markets in Europe, Asia Pacific, South America and North America reflecting the infrastructure, regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold.



Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric Vehicles



We are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including hybrid, plug-in hybrid, extended range and battery electric vehicles. We currently offer eight hybrid models and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology (PHEV) and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera. In 2013 we plan to produce the Chevrolet Spark battery electric vehicle. We plan to invest heavily in 2012 to support the expansion of our electric vehicle offerings and in-house development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries, electric motors and power control systems.



Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology



As part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, are the largest in the world and have accumulated more than 2.3 million miles of real-world driving by consumers, celebrities, business partners and government agencies.



OnStar



OnStar Corporation (OnStar) is a wholly owned subsidiary of GM serving more than 6 million subscribers in the U.S., Canada and China. OnStar is a provider of connected safety, security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on more than 45 of our 2012 model year vehicles. OnStar is also available for installation on most other vehicles already on the road through its recently launched OnStar FMV. OnStar's key services include automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle diagnostics and hands-free calling.



In recent years, OnStar has developed a system based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel which allows OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. OnStar also launched the automotive industry's first mobile application, leveraging OnStar's unique connection to the vehicle to provide drivers with up-to-date vehicle information such as oil level, tire pressure and fuel level as well as providing remote start and remote door unlock features and the ability to send directions from your phone to your vehicle.



Product Development



Our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization. This strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development. We define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces.



A centralized organization is responsible for many of the non-visible parts of the vehicle such as steering, suspension, the brake system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system. This team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world, who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand, such as exterior and interior design, tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements.








Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



Intellectual Property



We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.



Raw Materials, Services and Supplies



We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials are primarily composed of steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements.



In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10% to 12% of our total purchases from 2009 to 2011.



Environmental and Regulatory Matters



Automotive Emissions Control



We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic system (OBD) requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall. Emission and OBD requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world.



North America



The federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments. These requirements include pre-production testing of vehicles, testing of vehicles after assembly, the imposition of emission defect and performance warranties and the obligation to recall and repair vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements. We must obtain certification that the vehicles will meet emission requirements from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements.



We believe that our vehicles meet the current EPA and CARB requirements. If our vehicles do not comply with the emission standards or if defective emission control systems or components are discovered in such testing, or as part of government required defect reporting, we could incur substantial costs related to emissions recalls and possible fines. We expect that new CARB and federal requirements will increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance.



Fleet-wide compliance with current EPA and CARB emission standards must be achieved based on a sales-weighted fleet average. CARB has proposed its next round of emission requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2015 model year. The EPA is also developing similar requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year. These requirements are expected to include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards. Both the EPA and the CARB have enacted regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases. Since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of fuel economy requirement, they are discussed under “Automotive Fuel Economy.”



California law requires that 12% of 2012 model year cars and certain light-duty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles (ZEV) such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year. Manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial ZEV credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



system warranties. Additional portions of the ZEV requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial ZEV requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric propulsion systems meeting specified criteria. We are complying with the ZEV requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the partial ZEV requirements. CARB has also proposed 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs and PHEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals.



The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Twelve states as well as the Province of Quebec currently have these standards in effect. One state has adopted those standards beginning in the 2014 model year and additional states could also adopt the California standards in the future.



Vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements and could be recalled or fines could be imposed against us should testing or defect reporting identify noncompliance with emission requirements. We also certify heavy-duty engines for installation in other manufacturers' products. The heavy-duty exhaust standards became more stringent in the 2010 model year. We are using a system of credits to help meet these stringent standards as permitted by EPA and CARB regulations. OBD requirements were first applied to heavy-duty vehicles beginning with the 2010 model year, which we are meeting with certain hardware and software changes.



Europe



Emissions are regulated by two different entities: the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UN ECE). The EC imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 European Union (EU) Member States and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the UN ECE. EU Member States can give tax incentives to automobile manufacturers for vehicles which meet emission standards earlier than the compliance date. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the EU Member States. Type approval requires the manufacturer to provide a representative vehicle to the evaluating agency who then determines if the particular type of vehicle is fully compliant with the applicable regulations. The regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program. EC and UN ECE requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation.



A new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 5 standards, was applied in 2009, while stricter Euro 6 standards will apply beginning in 2014. The new European emission standards focus particularly on reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. The new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines. To comply with Euro 6 we expect that we will need to implement technologies which are identical to those being developed to meet U.S. emission standards. The technologies available today are not cost effective and would therefore not be suitable for the European market for small- and mid-size diesel vehicles which typically are under high cost pressure. Certain measures to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions have detrimental effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy.



In the long-term, notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in Europe, regulatory discussions in Europe are expected to continue. Regulators will continue to refine the testing requirements addressing issues such as test cycle, durability, OBD, in-service conformity and off-cycle emissions.



International Operations



China has implemented Euro 4 standards with European OBD requirements nationwide for newly registered vehicles. Beijing is expected to require many elements of Euro 5 standards for newly registered vehicles beginning in 2012 with additional elements of Euro 5 standards to be enforced beginning in 2014. Nationwide implementation of Euro 5 is expected between 2015 and 2017. For diesel-powered vehicles China has implemented Euro 4 standards for new type approvals of both light-duty diesel vehicles and all new registrations of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Enforcement of Euro 4 standards for new diesel light-duty registrations has been delayed until 2013.



South Korea has implemented Euro 5 standards with European OBD requirements for diesel-powered vehicles, and CARB standards for gasoline/LPG-powered vehicles.



South America






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES





Certain countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and others follow the EU test procedures, standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. Brazil implemented national L5 low emission vehicle standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2009. L6 standards for light diesel vehicles are to be implemented in 2012, which will mandate OBD requirements for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in 2014 for new vehicles and 2015 for all models. Argentina implemented Euro 4 standards starting with new vehicle registrations in 2009 and the implementation of Euro 5 standards has been delayed from 2012 to 2013 for new vehicles and from 2014 to 2016 for all vehicles. Other countries in the South American region either have adopted some level of U.S. or EU standards or no standards at all.



Industrial Environmental Control



Environmental Matters



Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.



The future effect of environmental matters including potential liabilities is often difficult to estimate. At December 31, 2011 our accruals for environmental liabilities were $169 million which is expected to be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites. Remediation periods typically range from five to 30 years.



Site Remediation



The following table summarizes the expenditures for site-remediation actions including ongoing operations and maintenance (dollars in millions):

SuccessorPredecessorYear EndedDecember 31, 2011Year EndedDecember 31, 2010July 10, 2009ThroughDecember 31, 2009January 1, 2009ThroughJuly 9, 2009Site remediation expenses$33$19$3$34



It is possible that such remediation actions could require average annual expenditures of $30 million over the next five years.



However, currently unidentified remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible can not be determined with specificity because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials located at the site, the involvement of other potentially responsible parties, the application of laws and other standards or regulations, site conditions and the nature and scope of investigations, studies and remediation to be undertaken (including the technologies to be required and the extent, duration and success of remediation). As a result we are unable to determine with specificity the total amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with all sites although that total could be substantial.



To mitigate the effects our worldwide facilities have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfill-free facilities. At December 31, 2011 81 (or 52%) of our facilities were landfill-free facilities. At our landfill-free facilities, over 90% of waste materials are recycled or reused and approximately 2% is converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. We estimate that we recycled or reused over 2.6 million metric tons of waste materials at our global operations and estimate that we converted 65,100 metric tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities in the year ended December 31, 2011.



We continue to implement our global energy strategy with a goal to increase our green power purchases. Our data collection and management system is designed to monitor and measure energy use as well as calculate the related CO2emissions including collecting and verifying energy, water and other environmental data from our facilities. Our approach to manage our greenhouse gas emissions includes a greenhouse gas reporting policy, global process to collect accurate data, internal and external targets and reporting progress against the established targets.

Automotive Fuel Economy



North America



Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) reporting is required for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Beginning with the 2011 model year both car and light-duty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes. In 2011 our domestic car standard was estimated to be 29.8 mpg, our import car standard was estimated to be 30.8 mpg and our light-duty truck standard was estimated to be 22.7 mpg. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal CAFE program.



In December 2011 the EPA and the United States National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a proposal to implement a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for the 2017 through 2025 model year light-duty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. This would represent a continuation of the national program that has been established for the 2012 through 2016 model year light-duty vehicles. This program includes EPA and NHTSA standards that will require an industry-wide target standard of 250 grams of carbon-related exhaust emissions per mile and 34.1 mpg by 2016. Our current product plan projects compliance with both federal programs through 2016.



The CARB regulates greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles (which is the same as regulating fuel economy). This California program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years. CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the California program for the 2012 through 2016 model years.



A Canadian governmental agency implemented greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with U.S. standards beginning with the 2011 model year. However these regulations do not require the separation of car fleet into domestic and import vehicles.



The Province of Quebec had previously adopted standards for the 2009 through 2016 model years that were equivalent to the California program but has revised their regulations to allow compliance with the national standards effective with the 2012 model year.



Europe



Legislation was passed in 2009 to regulate vehicle CO2emissions beginning in 2012. Based on a target function of CO2to vehicle weight, each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific sales-weighted fleet average target. This fleet average requirement will be phased in from 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. Automobile manufacturers can earn super-credits for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific CO2value of less than 50 grams CO2per kilometer. This is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultra-low CO2vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the CO2fleet average. Automobile manufacturers may gain credit of up to seven grams for eco-innovations for those technologies which improve real-world fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle, such as solar panels on vehicles. There is also a 5% credit for FlexFuel vehicles if more than 30% of refueling stations in an EU Member State sell E85. Further regulatory detail is being developed. The legislation sets a target of 95 grams CO2per kilometer for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement. We have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational CO2targets for each market entry in Europe.



In 2011 the EU adopted a standard to regulate CO2emissions from light commercial vehicles. This regulation is modeled after the CO2regulation for passenger cars. It proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average CO2target of 175 grams CO2per kilometer with a phase in of compliance from 2014 and full compliance required by 2016. The manufacturer-specific CO2compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel (vehicle curb weight). Flexibilities such as eco-innovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well. An EU long-term target for 2020 of 147 grams CO2per kilometer has been adopted for light commercial vehicles. We have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational CO2targets for each market entry in Europe.



An EC regulation has been adopted that will require low-rolling resistance tires, tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators by 2012. An additional EC regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise, fuel efficiency and rolling resistance, affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket.



Seventeen EU Member States have introduced fuel consumption or CO2based vehicle taxation schemes. Tax measures are within the jurisdiction of the EU Member States. We are faced with significant challenges relative to the predictability of future tax laws






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



and differences in the tax schemes and thresholds.



International Operations



We face new or increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards in many countries. China has established new Phase 3 fuel economy standards supplementing the current Phase 2 pass-fail system with a corporate fleet average scheme based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 model years. Implementation will be phased in beginning 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. China has continued its retail subsidies for consumers for fuel efficient vehicles, extended range and plug-in, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China is now working on a more aggressive Phase 4 fuel economy standard that is expected to apply to the 2016 through 2020 model years.



In Korea new preliminary fuel economy/CO2targets for 2012 through 2015 and beyond were previously announced as part of the government's low carbon/green growth strategy. These targets are based on each vehicle's curb weight but in general are set at levels more stringent than fuel economy/CO2targets in the U.S. but less stringent than fuel economy/CO2targets in Europe. The proposed standards will be phased in beginning in 2012 and full compliance required by 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify either on a fuel consumption basis or a CO2emissions basis. Each manufacturer will be given a corporate target to meet based on an overall industry fleet fuel economy/CO2average. Other aspects of the program being considered include credits, incentives and penalties. Korea has promulgated the new fuel economy/CO2regulation during the second quarter of 2011.



In Australia the government is planning to adopt attribute-based CO2standards beginning in 2015 with standards expected to become more stringent through 2020.



South America



In Brazil governmental bodies and the automobile manufacturers association established a national voluntary program for evaluation and labeling of light passenger and commercial vehicles equipped with internal combustion engines. This voluntary program aims to increase vehicle energy efficiency by labeling vehicles with fuel consumption measurements for urban, extra-urban and combined (equivalent to city and highway mpg measurements in the U.S.) driving conditions.



Chemical Regulations



North America



Governmental agencies in both the U.S. and Canada have introduced regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives, green chemistry and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives will give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle life-cycle including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing. These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in cost and supply chain complexity.



Europe



In 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances. These regulations require chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU in quantities of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency before 2018. During the pre-registration phase, Old GM and its suppliers registered those substances identified by these regulations. These regulations are to be phased in over a 10 year period. Under these regulations substances of very high concern may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future. This could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines. Our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements. We continually monitor the implementation of these regulations to maintain compliance and its effect on our suppliers and the automotive industry.



Safety



In the U.S. if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report information concerning






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S.



Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures. Other countries pass regulations which are more stringent than U.S. standards. Many countries require type approval while the U.S. and Canada require self-certification.



Vehicular Noise Control



In the U.S. passenger cars and light-duty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations. We identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements. Medium to heavy-duty trucks are regulated at the federal level. Federal truck regulations preempt all U.S. state or local noise regulations for trucks over a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lbs.



Outside the U.S. noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level (e.g., EC or UN ECE). We believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold.



While current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels, formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels. These proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles, specifically hybrids and electrics, may not be readily heard by pedestrians. The NHTSA is required to study and issue regulations for the minimum level of sound for hybrid and electric vehicles by January 2014. The UN ECE is developing an international standard for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels.



We are committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles to comply with these regulations and potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals.



Potential Effect of Regulations



We are actively working on aggressive near-term and long-term plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions, mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities, improve fuel efficiency, monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers. This is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles, our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles, our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of FlexFuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles. The conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfill-free status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability. We believe that the development and global implementation of new, cost-effective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities.



Despite these advanced technology efforts, our ability to satisfy fuel economy, CO2and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic, consumer, legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. If we are not able to comply with specific new requirements, which include higher CAFE standards and state CO2requirements such as those which require the CARB to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles (AB 1493 Rules), then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. Environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. Violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products. In turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.



Pension Legislation



We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal rules and regulations including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pension plans. Refer toNote 18to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the PPA. We do not have any required funding for our U.S. qualified plans in 2012. We also maintain pension plans for employees in a number of countries outside the U.S. which are subject to local laws and regulations.



Export Control



We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations and most countries in which we do business have applicable export






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



controls. Our Office of Export Compliance and our global Export Compliance Officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. Non-U.S. export controls are likely to become increasingly significant to our business as we develop our research and development operations on a global basis.



Automotive Financing - GM Financial



GM Financial (formerly AmeriCredit Corp.) which we acquired on October 1, 2010 for cash of $3.5 billion is our captive automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992. GM Financial purchases automobile finance contracts for new and used vehicles purchased by consumers primarily from franchised and select independent dealerships. GM Financial predominantly offers financing to consumers who are typically unable to obtain financing from more traditional sources. The typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700. GM Financial services its loan portfolio at regional centers using automated loan servicing and collection systems. Since GM Financial provides financing in a relatively high-risk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing.



GM Financial finances its loan origination volume through the use of credit facilities and securitization trusts that issue asset-backed securities to investors. GM Financial retains an interest in these securitization trusts that are over collateralized whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by GM Financial over the life of the securitization. Excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset-backed securities net of credit losses and expenses.



Excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts. Once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to GM Financial or, in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure, may be used to accelerate the repayment of certain subordinated securities. In addition to excess cash flows GM Financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts.



In December 2010 GM Financial began offering a lease product in certain geographic areas through our franchised dealerships that targets consumers with prime credit bureau scores leasing new GM vehicles. During 2011 GM Financial completed the nationwide rollout of the lease product in the U.S. including product offering for prime and sub-prime customers. GM Financial continued to expand its business in targeted areas that it viewed as strategic and to otherwise evaluate opportunities in specific segments of the automotive financing market. We expect any expansion of GM Financial including the anticipated expansion into offering commercial lending services to GM dealers in 2012 or any arrangements with other financing providers will complement our important relationship with Ally Financial.



In April 2011 GM Financial began originating leases for our customers in Canada.
