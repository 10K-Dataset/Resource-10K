Item 1. Business

General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors, or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts worldwide. We also provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial). Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions.

On July 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the Opel and Vauxhall businesses and certain other assets in Europe (the Opel/Vauxhall Business) to Peugeot, S.A. (PSA Group). On October 31, 2017 we closed the sale of the European financing subsidiaries and branches (the Fincos, and together with the Opel/Vauxhall Business, the European Business) to Banque PSA Finance S.A. and BNP Paribas Personal Finance S.A. The European Business was previously reported as our GM Europe (GME) segment and part of GM Financial. The European Business is presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of the European Business are presented as held for sale in our consolidated financial statements as ofDecember 31, 2016. Unless otherwise indicated, information in this report relates to our continuing operations.



Segment Reporting DataDuring the three months endedDecember 31, 2017, we changed our automotive segments as a result of changes in our organizational structure and the evolution of our business resulting from the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business and the various strategic actions taken in the GM International Operations (GMIO) region. As a result, our GM South America (GMSA) and GMIO operating segments are now reported as one, combined reportable international segment, GM International (GMI). Our GM North America (GMNA) and GM Financial segments were not impacted. All periods presented have been recast to reflect the changes. Operating segment data and principal geographic area data for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016and2015are summarized inNote 24to our consolidated financial statements.



AutomotiveOur automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GMNA and GMI. GMNA meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC and Holden brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Jiefang and Wuling brands.



In addition to the vehicles we sell through our dealer network to retail customers, we also sell vehicles directly or through our dealer network to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Our customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.



Competitive Position and Vehicle SalesThe principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include overall vehicle design, price, quality, available options, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.



We presentboth wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share.Wholesale vehicle sales data, which represents sales directly to dealers and others, including sales to fleet customers, is the measure that correlates toourrevenue from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. Wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles sold by joint ventures.In the year ended December 31, 201739% of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):

(b)Wholesale vehicle sales include131,128and 181 vehicles related to the transactions with the European Business for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.



Retail vehicle sales data, which represents sales to end customers based upon the good faith estimates of management, including sales to fleet customers, does not correlate directly to the revenuewe recognizeduring the period. However retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand forourvehicles. Market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume. In countries where retail vehicle sales data is not readily available, other data sources such as wholesale or forecast volumes are used to estimate retail vehicle sales to end customers.



Retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures. Retail vehicle sales data includes vehicles used by dealers under courtesy transportation programs and vehicles sold through the dealer registration channel, primarily in Europe. This sales channel consists primarily of dealer demonstrator, loaner and self-registered vehicles which are not eligible to be sold as new vehicles after being registered by dealers. Certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to daily rental car companies. The following table summarizes total industry retail sales, or estimated sales where retail sales volume is not available, of vehicles and our related competitive positionby geographic region (vehicles in thousands):

(b)Our China sales include the Automotive China JVs SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd. (SGMS), SAIC GM Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SGMW) and FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (FAW-GM).In the three months ended March 31, 2017 we began using estimated vehicle registrations data as the basis for calculating industry volume and market share in China.In the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015wholesale volumes were used for Industry, GM and Market Share.Our retail sales in China were3,871and 3,613 in the years ended December 31,2016and2015.

(c)Includes Industry and GM sales in India and South Africa. As of December 31, 2017 we have ceased sales of Chevrolet for the domestic markets in India and South Africa.

(d)We donot currently export vehicles to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria.Accordingly these countries are excluded from industry sales data and corresponding calculation ofmarket share.



In the year endedDecember 31, 2017we estimate we had the largest market share in North America and South America, and the number three market share in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region, which included the number two market share in China. Refer to the Overview in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) for discussion on changes in market share by region.



The sales and market share data provided in the table above includes both fleet vehicle sales and sales to retail customers. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable than sales to retail customers. A significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations.

Product PricingSeveral methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products.



Cyclical Nature of BusinessRetail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends in part on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending.



Relationship with DealersWe market vehicles and automotive parts worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets.



The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

December 31, 2017December 31, 2016December 31, 2015GMNA4,8094,8574,886GMI7,6418,5989,177Total12,45013,45514,063








Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers with access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial and other financial institutions.



The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws and regulations that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.



Research, Product and Business Development and Intellectual PropertyCosts for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions control, improved fuel economy, electrification, autonomous vehicles, the safety of drivers and passengers, and urban mobility. Research and development expenses were$7.3 billion,$6.6 billionand$6.0 billionin the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016and2015.



Product DevelopmentThe Product Development organization is responsible for designing and integrating vehicle and powertrain components to maximize part sharing across multiple vehicle segments. Global teams in Design, Program Management, Component & Subsystem Engineering, Product Integrity, Safety, Propulsion Systems and Purchasing & Supply Chain collaborate to meet customer requirements and maximize global economies of scale.



Our global vehicle architecture development is headquartered at our Global Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. Cross-segment part sharing is an essential enabler to our Vehicle Set Strategy, designed to reduce our overall number of global vehicle architectures to four major vehicle sets. As we implement the four vehicle sets, we will continue to leverage our current architecture portfolio to accommodate our customers around the world while achieving our financial goals.



Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric VehiclesWe are investing in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eAssist, plug-in hybrid, full hybrid, extended range and zero emission battery electric vehicles that are part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and GHG emissions. We currently offer seven models in the U.S. featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Bolt EV. In October 2017 we announced our plans to launch more than 20 new Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEVs) in global markets by 2023, including two in the next 18 months.



Car- and Ride-SharingOur car-sharing brand Maven gives customers access to highly personalized, on-demand mobility services. Maven is available in 18 cities across the U.S. and Canada and has started first pilot operations in Australia. Maven offers three different types of consumer and commercial services. Maven Gig allows members to earn money on their own terms by providing a vehicle that can be used to deliver goods or ride-sharing services provided by Lyft, Inc. (Lyft) and Uber Technologies Inc. Maven City offers vehicles with dedicated parking spots for easy city driving with the cost of gas or electric charging included. Vehicles are available by the hour, day, week or month. Maven Home provides on-site car sharing for residential communities. ThroughDecember 31, 2017Maven has accumulated over 230 million miles driven, 5 million all-electric miles driven, 114,000 reservations and has 104,000 members.



Autonomous TechnologyWe see autonomous technology leading to a future of zero congestion, zero emissions and zero crashes, since more than 90% of crashes are caused by driver error, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). We are among the leaders in the industry with significant global real-world experience in delivering connectivity, safety and security services to millions of customers through OnStar, LLC (OnStar) and advanced safety features that are the building blocks to more advanced automation features that are driving our leadership position in the development of autonomous technology. An example of advanced automation is Super Cruise, a hands-free driving customer convenience feature that is available on the 2018 Cadillac CT6 sedan.



We are actively testing autonomous vehicles on public roads in San Francisco, California; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Warren, Michigan. Additionally, we plan to develop an integrated network of on-demand autonomous vehicles in the U.S. In November






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



2017 we announced that our growing fleet of test vehicles will accumulate a significant number of miles in 2018, and based on our current rate of change we expect commercial launch at scale in dense urban environments in 2019.



Alternative Fuel VehiclesWe believe alternative fuels offer significant potential to reduce petroleum consumption and resulting GHG emissions in the transportation sector. By leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on ethanol-gasoline blend fuels as well as technologies that support compressed natural gas and liquefied petroleum gas.



We offer a variety of FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the2018model year to retail and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. In Brazil, a substantial majority of vehicles sold are FlexFuel vehicles capable of running on high ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in other global markets where biofuels are in the marketplace. We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources.



Hydrogen Fuel Cell TechnologyAnother part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and GHG emissions is our commitment to the development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, have accumulated more than 3 million miles of real-world driving. These programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of vehicles with this technology. We are exploring non-traditional automotive uses for fuel cells in several areas, including demonstrations with the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy.



We signed a co-development agreement and established a nonconsolidated JV with Honda Motor Company in 2016 for a next-generation fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies, aiming for the 2020 timeframe for commercialization. The collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise, economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon GM's and Honda Motor Company's strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology.



OnStarOnStar is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM serving more than 7 million subscribers. OnStar is a provider of connected safety, security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our2018model year vehicles. OnStar's key services include automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle diagnostics, hands-free calling and 4G LTE wireless connectivity.



Intellectual PropertyWe generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents are individually material to our business as a whole, these patents are important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.



Raw Materials, Services and SuppliesWe purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers to manufacture our products. The raw materials primarily include steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements.



In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of these risks. Combined purchases from our two largest suppliers have been approximately 12% of our total purchases in each of the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016and2015.



Environmental and Regulatory Matters



Automotive Emissions ControlWe are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system and other in-use compliance monitoring activities may increase warranty costs and the likelihood of recall. Emission and OBD requirements have become more stringent as a result of lower emission standards and new diagnostic requirements which have come into force in many markets around the world driven by policy priorities such as air quality, energy security and climate change, often with very little harmonization of the regulations. While we believe all of our products are designed and manufactured






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



in material compliance with substantially all vehicle emissions requirements, regulatory authorities may conduct ongoing evaluations of the emissions compliance of products from all manufacturers. This includes vehicle emissions testing, including CO2and nitrogen oxide emissions testing, and review of emission control designs and strategies.



The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S., and various state governments impose additional emission requirements established by California. Canada’s federal government vehicle emission requirements are generally aligned with the U.S. federal requirements. Each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada, and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements.



CARB's latest emission requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in ZEVs which must be offered for sale in California. CARB has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs to achieve GHG as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term GHG reduction goals. The Canadian Province of Quebec also plans to adopt ZEV requirements starting with the 2018 model year largely based on California program requirements. There is a possibility that additional jurisdictions could adopt ZEV requirements in the future. The EPA has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which began a multi-year phase-in with the 2017 model year, but do not include ZEV requirements. These new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance.



The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the ZEV requirements.



China implemented the China 5 emission standard nationwide at the beginning of 2017. China 5 is more stringent than the previous program on all levels including overall emission requirements and the time and mileage period for which vehicles need to meet China 5 level performance. China will implement a unique China 6 emission standard that combines elements of both European and U.S. standards, includes more stringent emission requirements and increases the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance. Nationwide implementation for new registrations is expected in July 2020 for China 6a and July 2023 for the more stringent China 6b standard. However, localities can pull ahead China 6 requirements if certain criteria are met. Some cities may implement China 6 as early as January 2019.



In South America certain countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and others follow theEuropean Union test procedures, standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. Brazil implemented national L6 standards for light diesel vehicles in 2012 and OBD installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles were implemented in 2015 for all models.



As a result of the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business, GM’s vehicle presence in Europe will be smaller, but GM may be affected by actions taken by regulators related to products sold before the sale of the Opel/Vauxhall Business and future products sold by GM in Europe. For example, in Germany, a number of automotive manufacturers, including our former German subsidiary, have participated in continuing discussions with German and European Union authorities concerning emissions control systems. In the European Union, increased scrutiny of compliance with emissions standards may result in changes to these standards, including implementation of “real world driving” emissions (RDE) tests, as well as stricter interpretations or redefinition of these standards and more rigorous enforcement. This may lead to increased costs, penalties, and lack of certainty related to product portfolio planning, negative publicity or reputation impact for us. In the long-term, we expect that the European Commission will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle, RDE, low temperature testing, fuel evaporation and OBD.



Automotive Fuel EconomyIn theU.S., NHTSA promulgates and enforces Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Manufacturers are subject to substantial civil penalties if they fail to meet the applicable CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding five model years and expected credits for the three succeeding model years. In addition to federal CAFE reporting, the EPA promulgates and enforces GHG emission standards, which are effectively fuel economy standards because the majority of vehicle GHG emissions are the result of fuel combustion. In addition, CARB has asserted the right to promulgate and enforce its own state GHG standards for motor vehicles, and other states have asserted the right to adopt the California standards. However, CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal EPA light duty GHG program is deemed to be in compliance with the California standards through the 2025 model year.








Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



China has two fuel economy requirements for passenger vehicles: an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement and a fleet average fuel consumption requirement. The current China Phase 4 fleet fuel consumption requirement is effective from 2016-2020. China Phase 4 is based on curb weight with full compliance to 5.0L/100 km required by 2020. China Phase 4 has continued subsidies for plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China Phase 5 is currently being developed with a planned start in 2021 with full compliance to 4.0L/100km required by 2025. China recently announced the details of the New Energy Vehicle Mandate. This will require passenger car manufacturers to produce a certain volume of plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cells vehicles to generate "credits" equivalent to 10% in 2019 and 12% in 2020. The number of credits per car is based on the level of E-range and energy efficiency.



Regulators in other jurisdictions have already adopted or are developing fuel economy or carbon dioxide regulations. If regulators in these jurisdictions seek to impose and enforce emission standards that are misaligned with market conditions, we may be forced to take various actions to increase market support programs for more fuel-efficient vehicles and curtail production of certain high-performance cars, trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs) in order to achieve compliance. We regularly evaluate our current and future product plans and strategies for compliance with fuel economy and GHG regulations.



Industrial Environmental ControlOur operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.



To mitigate the effects of our worldwide operations on the environment, we are converting as many of our worldwide operations as possible to landfill-free operations which reduces GHG emissions associated with waste disposal. AtDecember 31, 2017, 80 (or approximately 50%) of our manufacturing operations were landfill-free. Additionally, 63 of our non-manufacturing operations are landfill-free. At our landfill-free manufacturing operations approximately 95% of waste materials are composted, reused, or recycled and approximately 4% are converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. In 2017 we estimate that our waste reduction program diverted 1.5 million metric tons of waste from landfill, resulting in approximately 6.6 million metric tons of GHG emissions avoided in global manufacturing operations, including construction, demolition and remediation wastes.



In addition to minimizing our impact on the environment, our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production by-products, reduce our use of material, reduce our carbon footprint and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal.



We continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency and work to drivegrowth and scale of renewables. We have committed to meeting the electricity needs of our operations worldwide with renewableenergy by 2050. AtDecember 31, 2017we had implemented projects or signed renewable energy contracts globally that hadincreased our total renewable energy capacity to over 400 megawatts. In 2017 GM executed two 100 megawatt wind powerpurchase agreements to match our Ohio and Indiana manufacturing plant load when each of these projects come online in 2018. We continue to seek opportunities for a diversified renewable energy portfolio including wind, solar, and landfill gas. In 2017 Energy Star certified three of our assembly plants and 17 buildings for superior energy management. We also met the EPA Energy Star Challenge for Industry (EPA Challenge)at eight additional sites globallyby reducing energy intensity an average of 18% at these sites. To meet the EPA Challenge, industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10% within a five year period. In total 71 GM-owned sites have met the EPA Challenge, with many sites achieving the goal multiple times. These efforts minimize our utility expenses andare part of our approach to addressing climate change through setting a GHG emissions reduction target, collecting accurate data, following our business plan and publicly reporting progress against our target.



Chemical RegulationsWe continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.



Globally, governmental agencies continue to introduce new legislation and regulations related to the selection and use of chemicals by mandating broad prohibitions or restrictions and implementing green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Global treaties and initiatives such as the Stockholm, Basel and Rotterdam Conventions on Chemicals and Waste and the Minamata Convention on Mercury, are driving chemical regulations across signatory countries. In addition, more global jurisdictions are establishing substance standards with regard to Vehicle Interior Air Quality.








Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



Chemical regulations are increasing in North America. InJune 2016, the U.S. enacted the Chemical Safety for the 21stCentury Actthat grants the EPA increased authority to regulate and restrict chemical use in the U.S. and is expected to increase the level of regulation of chemicals in vehicles. Chemical restrictions in Canada continue to progress rapidly as a result of Environment Canada's Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic.



China prohibits the use of several chemical substances in vehicles. There are also various regulations in China stipulating the requirements for chemical management. Among other things, these regulations catalogue and restrict the use and the import and export of various chemical substances. The failure of our joint venture partners or our suppliers to comply with these regulations could disrupt production in China or prevent our joint venture partners from selling the affected products in the China market.



These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. We believe that we are materially in compliance with substantially all of these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates.



SafetyIn the U.S. the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 prohibits the sale of any new vehicle or equipment in the U.S. that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by the NHTSA. If we or NHTSA determine that either a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S.



Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures, adding complexity to regulatory compliance.



Automotive Financing - GM FinancialGM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company and our global provider of automobile finance solutions. GM Financial conducts its business in North America, South America and through a joint venture in China.



GM Financial provides retail loan and lease lending across the credit spectrum. Additionally GM Financial offers commercial products to dealers that include new and used vehicle inventory financing and dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, and to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Other commercial products include financing for parts and accessories, dealer fleets and storage centers.



In North America GM Financial's retail automobile finance programs include full credit spectrum lending and leasing. The sub-prime lending program is primarily offered to consumers with FICO scores less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending. The leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and primarily targets prime consumers leasing new vehicles. GM Financial has expanded its leasing and prime lending programs through our franchised dealers, and as a result, leasing and prime lending have become a larger percentage of originations and the retail portfolio balance.



Internationally GM Financial’s retail automobile finance programs focus on financing new GM vehicles and select used vehicles.



Generally GM Financial seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, through securitization transactions where such markets are developed and through the issuance of unsecured debt in public markets.
