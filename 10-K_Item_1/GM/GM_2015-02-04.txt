Item 1. Business

General Motors Company (sometimes referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “ourselves,” the “Company,” “General Motors,” or “GM") was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell cars, trucks and automobile parts worldwide. We also provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial).



Automotive



Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our four automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA), GM Europe (GME), GM International Operations (GMIO) and GM South America (GMSA). Our total worldwide retail vehicle sales were9.9 million,9.7 millionand9.3 millionincluding sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage ownership in the joint venture in the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012.



GMNA primarily meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. The demands of customers outside North America are primarily met with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Holden, Opel and Vauxhall brands. We also have equity ownership stakes directly or indirectly in entities through various regional subsidiaries, primarily in Asia. These companies design, manufacture and market vehicles under the Alpheon, Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Jiefang and Wuling brands.



In addition to the products we sell to our dealers for consumer retail sales, we also sell cars and trucks to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. We sell vehicles to fleet customers directly or through our network of dealers. Our retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of aftersale vehicle services and products through our dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.



Competitive Position



The global automotive industry is highly competitive. The principal factors that determine consumer vehicle preferences in the markets in which we operate include price, quality, available options, style, safety, reliability, fuel economy and functionality. Market leadership in individual countries in which we compete varies widely.



Vehicle Sales



We present both wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. We do not currently export vehicles to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Accordingly, these countries are excluded from industry sales data in the tables below and corresponding calculations of our market share.



Wholesale Vehicle Sales



Wholesale vehicle sales data, which represents sales directly to dealers and others, is the measure that correlates vehicle sales to our revenue from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of automotive Net sales and revenue. Wholesale vehicle sales exclude vehicles produced by unconsolidated joint ventures. In the year endedDecember 31, 2014,52.9%of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):

Retail Vehicle Sales



Retail vehicle sales data, which represents estimated sales to the end customer, including fleets, does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period. However, retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles, is the basis for our market share, and is based upon the good faith estimates of management. Retail vehicle sales data includes sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures. Market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume, but estimates may be used where retail vehicle sales volume is not available.



In countries where end customer data is not readily available other data sources, such as wholesale or forecast volumes, are used to estimate retail vehicle sales. Certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to the daily rental car companies. The following table summarizes total industry retail sales volume, or estimated sales volume where retail sales volume is not available, of new vehicles and the related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):

In the year endedDecember 31, 2014we estimate we had the largest market share in North America and South America, the number six market share in Europe and the number two market share in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region. In the year endedDecember 31, 2014the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region was our largest region by retail vehicle sales volume and represented44.1%of our global retail vehicle sales.



Our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year endedDecember 31, 2014grew at a slightly slower pace than the overall industry, resulting in a0.1%industry share decline. All new and refreshed vehicles gained share in 2014, but were outpaced by losses on vehicles that were late in their lifecycle, largely due to an aggressive competitive environment. Our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year endedDecember 31, 2013reflect continued recovery in the U.S. despite an intense competitive environment. Growth was largely attributed to new or refreshed models. Our retail vehicle sales volumes in the year endedDecember 31, 2012reflect an intensified competitive environment in the U.S., including aggressive competitor pricing and media spending, as well as key competitor new product launches.



Fleet Sales and Deliveries



The sales and market share data provided previously includes both retail and fleet vehicle sales. Certain fleet transactions, particularly daily rental, are generally less profitable than retail sales. A significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations. The following table summarizes estimated fleet sales and those sales as a percentage of total retail vehicle sales (vehicles in thousands):

Product Pricing



Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. In2015we will continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required. We believe this strategy, coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices.



Cyclical Nature of Business



Retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending.



Relationship with Dealers



We market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets.



The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

December 31, 2014December 31, 2013December 31, 2012GMNA4,9084,9465,015GME6,6337,0877,574GMIO7,6997,4726,915GMSA1,2721,2011,250Total worldwide20,51220,70620,754



We and our joint ventures enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial, Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally Financial) and other financial institutions.



The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.



Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property



Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control, improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers. In the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 research and development expenses were$7.4 billion,$7.2 billionand$7.4 billion.



One of our priorities for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy. Our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption.



Fuel Efficiency








Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



We are fully committed to improving fuel efficiency and meeting regulatory standards through a combination of strategies including: (1) extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains; (2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions; and (3) vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures.



Alternative Fuel Vehicles



We believe alternative fuels offer the greatest near-term potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. Leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on gasoline-ethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).



We currently offer 13 FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the 2015 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. We continue to study the future role FlexFuel vehicles may play in the U.S. in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure. In Brazil a substantial majority of vehicles sold were FlexFuel vehicles capable of running on 100% ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in Australia, Thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace.



We produce CNG bi-fuel capable vehicles in Europe such as the Opel Zafira and in the U.S. with the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana full-size vans (fleet and commercial customers) and the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2500 HD pick-up trucks (commercial and retail customers) that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and CNG. In addition we recently launched the CNG bi-fuel Chevrolet Impala full-size sedan to both fleet and retail markets in the U.S. We offer LPG capable vehicles globally in select markets reflecting the infrastructure, regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold.



We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources, and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels.



Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric Vehicles



We are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eAssist, plug-in hybrid, extended range and battery electric vehicles. We currently offer seven models in the U.S. featuring some form of electrification and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology (PHEV) and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt, Opel Ampera and Cadillac ELR. In 2014 we introduced the Cadillac ELR extended range luxury coupe and introduced a second-generation Chevrolet Volt at the 2015 North American International Auto Show. The next-generation Chevrolet Volt symbolizes our continued commitment to expansion of vehicle electrification and the development of accompanying electrification technologies including battery systems, electric motors and advanced electronic controls.



Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology



As part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, have accumulated more than 3 million miles of real-world driving by consumers, celebrities, business partners and government agencies. These programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of this technology.



GM and Honda entered into a long-term agreement to co-develop a next-generation fuel cell system and hydrogen storage technologies, aiming for the 2020 timeframe. The collaboration expects to succeed by sharing expertise, economies of scale and common sourcing strategies and builds upon GM's and Honda’s strengths as leaders in hydrogen fuel cell technology.



OnStar, LLC



OnStar, LLC (OnStar) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM serving more than 6.8 million subscribers in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and, through a joint venture, China, with expectations to expand to Europe. OnStar is a provider of connected safety, security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2015 model year vehicles. OnStar's key services include automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle diagnostics, hands-free calling and 4G LTE wireless connectivity.






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES





OnStar has developed a system based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel which allows OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. OnStar also offers a mobile application to provide subscribers with up-to-date vehicle information such as oil level, tire pressure and fuel level as well as providing remote start, remote door unlock and navigation services from a mobile phone.



Product Development



Our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization. This strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development. We define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces.



A centralized organization is responsible for many of the non-visible parts of the vehicle such as steering, suspension, the brake system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system. This team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world, who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand, such as exterior and interior design, tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements.



Intellectual Property



We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.



Raw Materials, Services and Supplies



We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials are primarily composed of steel, aluminum, resins, copper, lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements.



In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Total purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10% to 11% of our total purchases from 2012 to 2014.



Environmental and Regulatory Matters



Automotive Emissions Control



We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall. Emission and OBD requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world.



U.S. and Canada



The U.S. federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments. Canada’s federal government vehicle criteria emission requirements are generally aligned with the U.S. federal requirements. These requirements include vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and OBD system requirements. Each model year we must obtain certification for each test group that our vehicles will meet emission requirements from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements.






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES





While we believe all our products are in compliance with EPA and CARB certification requirements, both agencies have ongoing “in-use” evaluations of compliance for products from all manufacturers. It is possible that we or either agency could identify potential non-compliance, which could lead to some type of field action to remedy the issue. Testing includes pre-production testing of vehicles as part of certification and in-use testing of customer vehicles at specified mileages.



CARB has adopted its next round of emission requirements which phase in with the 2015 model year. These requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards including an increase in zero emission vehicles (ZEV) such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. CARB has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. The EPA has adopted similar exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards which phase in with the 2017 model year. These new requirements will also increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance.



The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Thirteen states currently have these standards in effect and 10 of these 13 states have adopted the ZEV requirements.



Europe



Emissions are regulated by two different entities: the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The EC imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 28 European Union (EU) Member States and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the UNECE. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the EU Member States. The regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program. EU and UNECE requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation.



A new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 5, was effective in 2011. Future European emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. The Euro 6 emission levels will become effective in 2017. The new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines. To comply with Euro 6 standards we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those being developed to meet U.S. emission standards. These technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging European market for small and mid-size diesel vehicles. Gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements. The measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy.



In the long-term, notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in Europe, the EC will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle, real driving emission, low temperature testing, fuel evaporation and OBD. We are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date.



China



China has implemented European type China 4 standards nationally with European OBD requirements nationwide for all newly registered vehicles. Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou each required China 5 standards by the end of 2014 for newly registered vehicles. Tianjin, Hebei Province, the Pearl River and the Yangtze River delta regions are each expected to require China 5 standards prior to nationwide implementation of China 5 in 2017. The Beijing municipality is currently considering the implementation of a China unique emission standard for China 6 with the potential to combine elements of European and U.S. standards as early as 2017. We are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date.



Automotive Fuel Economy



U.S.



Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) reporting is required for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Both car and light-duty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes. In 2015 our domestic car standard is estimated to be 34.8 mpg, our import car standard is estimated






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



at 38.4 mpg, and our light-duty truck standard is estimated to be 25.6 mpg. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal CAFE program through the 2015 model year. In addition to federal CAFE the U.S. EPA requires compliance with greenhouse gas requirements that are similar to the CAFE program. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal greenhouse gas program through the 2015 model year. CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the California program for the 2012 through 2016 model years.



Europe



Legislation regulating fleet average CO2emissions was implemented for passenger cars in 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. Requirements must be met through the introduction of CO2reducing technologies on conventional engines or ultra-low CO2vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera. The EU has adopted an even more stringent CO2regulation as of 2020. Along with the passenger car target, the EU also adopted a new fleet average target as of 2020. We are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational CO2targets for each market entry in Europe.



Effective in 2012 an EC regulation required low-rolling resistance tires, tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators. An additional EC regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for noise, fuel efficiency and rolling resistance, affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket.



China



China has both an individual vehicle pass-fail type approval requirement based on Phase 2 standards and a fleet fuel consumption requirement based on Phase 3 standards based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 calendar years. Implementation began in 2012 with full compliance to 6.9L/100km required by 2015. China has continued subsidies for fuel efficient vehicles, plug-in hybrid, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China is now working on a more aggressive Phase 4 fleet fuel consumption standard that is expected to apply beginning in 2016, with full compliance to 5.0L/100km required by 2020.



Industrial Environmental Control



Environmental Matters



Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources. Refer toNote 17to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on environmental matters including site remediation.



To mitigate the effects our worldwide operations have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfill-free facilities. At December 31, 2014, 88 (or approximately 50%) of our manufacturing facilities were landfill-free facilities. Additionally we have 34 non-manufacturing facilities that are landfill free. At our landfill-free manufacturing facilities approximately 93% of waste materials are recycled or reused and 6% is converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. Including construction, demolition and remediation wastes, we estimate that we recycled, reused, or composted over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations and estimate that we converted approximately 100,000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities in the year ended December 31, 2014.



In addition to providing environmental benefits our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments generate revenue from the sale of production by-products, reduce our carbon footprint, and help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal.



We continue to search for ways to increase our use of renewable energy and improve our energy efficiency. At December 31, 2014 we have implemented projects globally that have increased our renewable energy capacity by over 35 megawatts, bringing our total renewable energy capacity to over 100 megawatts. In 2014 we also met the Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Challenge for Industryat an additional 14 of our sites globallyby reducing energy intensity an average of 17%. To meet the EPA challenge industrial sites must reduce energy intensity by 10% in five years or fewer. All 14 sites achieved the goal in no more than four years, with most meeting it in less than two years, bringing the total number of GM-owned sites to have met the Energy Star Challenge to 70.



Chemical Regulations






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES





We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers and the automotive industry.



U.S. and Canada



Governmental agencies in both the U.S. and Canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of chemicals or substances of concern by mandating broad prohibitions, green chemistry, life cycle analysis and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle's life, as well as, chemical selection for product development and manufacturing. Chemical restrictions in Canada are progressing more rapidly than in the U.S. as a result of Environment Canada’s Chemical Management Plan to assess existing substances and implement risk management controls on any chemical deemed toxic. These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity. We are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date.



The U.S. Congress is currently pursuing an update of the Toxic Substances Control Act to grant the EPA more authority to regulate and ban chemicals from use in the U.S. which, if passed, is expected to greatly increase the level of regulation of chemicals in vehicles.



Europe



In 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements, the EU REACH regulation among others, to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances. This regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency before 2018. Under this regulation, “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future. This could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts, or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines. Our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements. We are currently in compliance with all material components of these requirements or expect to be in compliance by the required date.



Safety



In the U.S. if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S.



Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures. Other countries sometimes pass regulations which are more stringent than U.S. standards. Refer toNote 13for more information on significant recall activities in 2014.



Vehicular Noise Control



In the U.S. passenger cars and light-duty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations. We identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements. Medium to heavy-duty trucks are regulated at the federal level.



Outside the U.S. noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level. We believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold. In 2014 the EU published a directive that mandates a significant decrease in vehicle noise emissions with a mandatory application beginning in 2016. The directive of the EU also forms the basis for amendment to UNECE vehicle regulations, with the effect that maximum noise regulations will become more stringent in all markets outside of North America.



While current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels, formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels. These proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles, specifically hybrids and

electrics, may not be readily heard by pedestrians. In the U.S., National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in January 2013 and the U.S. Department of Transportation indicated a final rule is expected to be published in 2015. The UNECE is developing a Global Technical Regulation, sponsored by the U.S., Japan, and the EU, for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels.



Automotive Financing - GM Financial



GM Financial is our global captive automotive finance company. GM Financial conducts its business in North America and, as a result of the 2013 acquisition of the Ally Financial international operations, in Europe and Latin America. Latin America includes operations located in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. In January 2015 GM Financial completed the acquisition of Ally Financial's equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (formerly known as GMAC-SAIC Automotive Finance Company Limited) (SAIC-GMAC) which conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in China.



GM Financial provides consumer lending, both loan and lease, across the credit spectrum. Additionally GM Financial offers commercial products to dealer customers that include new and used vehicle inventory financing, inventory insurance, working capital, capital improvement loans, fleet financing and storage center financing.



In North America GM Financial's consumer automobile finance programs include sub-prime lending, full credit spectrum leasing and, more recently, prime lending. The sub-prime lending program is primarily offered to consumers with FICO scores of less than 620 who have limited access to automobile financing through banks and credit unions, and is expected to sustain a higher level of credit losses than prime lending. GM Financial is currently seeking to expand its prime lending programs through our franchised dealers and anticipates that prime lending will become an increasing percentage of originations and the consumer portfolio balance over time. The leasing product is offered through our franchised dealers and primarily targets prime consumers leasing new vehicles.



Internationally GM Financial’s consumer automobile finance programs focus on financing prime quality consumers, leasing in several countries and finance-related insurance products through third parties, such as credit life, gap and extended warranty coverage.



GM Financial seeks to fund its operations in each country through local sources of funding to minimize currency and country risk. GM Financial primarily finances its loan, lease and commercial origination volume through the use of secured and unsecured credit facilities, through securitization transactions where such markets are developed and through the issuance of unsecured debt.



GM Financial retains an interest in the securitization transactions in the form of restricted cash accounts and overcollateralization, whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts, as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by GM Financial over the life of the securitization. Excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset-backed securities net of credit losses and expenses. Excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially retained to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts. Once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to GM Financial.
