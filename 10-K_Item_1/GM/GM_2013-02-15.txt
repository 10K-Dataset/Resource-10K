Product Pricing



Several methods are used to promote our products, including the use of dealer, retail and fleet incentives such as customer rebates and finance rate support. The level of incentives is dependent in large part upon the level of competition in the markets in which we operate and the level of demand for our products. In 2013 we will continue to price vehicles competitively, including offering strategic and tactical incentives as required. We believe this strategy, coupled with sound inventory management, will continue to strengthen the reputation of our brands and result in competitive prices.



Cyclical Nature of Business



Retail sales are cyclical and production varies from month to month. Vehicle model changeovers occur throughout the year as a result of new market entries. The market for vehicles depends on general economic conditions, credit availability and consumer spending.



Relationship with Dealers



We market vehicles worldwide primarily through a network of independent authorized retail dealers. These outlets include distributors, dealers and authorized sales, service and parts outlets.



The following table summarizes the number of authorized dealerships:

December 31, 2012December 31, 2011December 31, 2010GMNA5,0155,0685,167GME7,5747,7457,859GMIO6,9156,9016,053GMSA1,2501,1621,136Total worldwide20,75420,87620,215



We enter into a contract with each authorized dealer agreeing to sell to the dealer one or more specified product lines at wholesale






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



prices and granting the dealer the right to sell those vehicles to retail customers from an approved location. Our dealers often offer more than one GM brand at a single dealership in a number of our markets in order to enhance dealer profitability. Authorized dealers offer parts, accessories, service and repairs for GM vehicles in the product lines that they sell using GM parts and accessories. Our dealers are authorized to service GM vehicles under our limited warranty program and those repairs are to be made only with GM parts. Our dealers generally provide their customers access to credit or lease financing, vehicle insurance and extended service contracts provided by GM Financial, Ally Financial, Inc. (Ally Financial) and other financial institutions.



The quality of GM dealerships and our relationship with our dealers and distributors are critical to our success as dealers maintain the primary sales and service interface with the end consumer of our products. In addition to the terms of our contracts with our dealers we are regulated by various country and state franchise laws that may supersede those contractual terms and impose specific regulatory requirements and standards for initiating dealer network changes, pursuing terminations for cause and other contractual matters.



Research, Product Development and Intellectual Property



Costs for research, manufacturing engineering, product engineering, and design and development activities relate primarily to developing new products or services or improving existing products or services including activities related to vehicle emissions control, improved fuel economy and the safety of drivers and passengers.



The following table summarizes research and development expense (dollars in millions):

Years Ended December 31,201220112010Research and development expense$7,368$8,124$6,962



Our top priority for research is to continue to develop and advance our alternative propulsion strategy because energy diversity and environmental leadership are critical elements of our overall business strategy. Our objective is to be the recognized industry leader in fuel efficiency through the development of a wide variety of technologies to reduce petroleum consumption.



Fuel Efficiency



We are fully committed to meeting the requirements of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 and compliance with other regulatory schemes. We plan to achieve compliance through a combination of strategies including: (1) extensive technology improvements to conventional powertrains; (2) increased use of smaller displacement engines and improved and advanced automatic transmissions; (3) vehicle improvements including increased use of lighter, front-wheel drive architectures; (4) increased hybrid and electric vehicle offerings; and (5) portfolio changes including increasing car/crossover mix and dropping select larger vehicles in favor of smaller, more fuel efficient offerings.



Alternative Fuel Vehicles



Alternative fuels offer the greatest near-term potential to reduce liquid petroleum consumption in the transportation sector. Leveraging experience and capability developed around these technologies in our global operations we continue to develop FlexFuel vehicles that can run on gasoline-ethanol blend fuels as well as vehicles that run on compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).



We currently offer 21 FlexFuel vehicles in the U.S. for the 2013 model year plus an additional four models to fleet and commercial customers capable of operating on gasoline, E85 ethanol or any combination of the two. We continue to study the future role FlexFuel vehicles may play in the U.S. in light of recent regulatory developments and the rate of development of the refueling infrastructure. In201295% of vehicle sales in Brazil were FlexFuel vehicles capable of running on 100% ethanol blends. We also market FlexFuel vehicles in Australia, Thailand and other global markets where biofuels have emerged in the marketplace.



We support the development of biodiesel blend fuels, which are clean-burning alternative diesel fuels produced from renewable sources, and we provide biodiesel capabilities in other markets reflecting the availability of biodiesel blend fuels.



We produce CNG bi-fuel capable vehicles in Europe such as the Opel Zafira, and in the U.S., the Chevrolet Express and GMC Savana fullsize vans are offered to fleet and commercial customers, that are capable of switching between gasoline or diesel and CNG. In November 2012 we began production of the CNG bi-fuel Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2500 HD pickup trucks






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



that are available to both commercial and retail customers. We offer LPG capable vehicles in select markets in Europe, Asia Pacific, South America and North America reflecting the infrastructure, regulatory focus and natural resource availability of the markets in which they are sold.



Hybrid, Plug-In, Extended Range and Battery Electric Vehicles



We are investing significantly in multiple technologies offering increasing levels of vehicle electrification including eAssist, plug-in hybrid, extended range and battery electric vehicles. We currently offer 12 hybrid models and continue to develop plug-in hybrid electric vehicle technology (PHEV) and extended range electric vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera. In 2013 we plan to produce the Chevrolet Spark pure electric vehicle and plan to invest heavily to support the expansion of our electric vehicle offerings and in-house development and manufacturing capabilities of advanced batteries, electric motors and power control systems.



Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology



As part of our long-term strategy to reduce petroleum consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we are committed to continuing development of our hydrogen fuel cell technology. Our Chevrolet Equinox fuel cell electric vehicle demonstration programs, such as Project Driveway, have accumulated more than 2.5 million miles of real-world driving by consumers, celebrities, business partners and government agencies. These programs are helping us identify consumer and infrastructure needs to understand the business case for potential production of this technology.



OnStar



OnStar, LLC (OnStar) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of GM serving more than 6.3 million subscribers in the U.S. and Canada and, through a joint venture, China. OnStar is a provider of connected safety, security and mobility solutions and advanced information technology and is available on the majority of our 2013 model year vehicles. OnStar's key services include automatic crash response, stolen vehicle assistance, remote door unlock, turn-by-turn navigation, vehicle diagnostics and hands-free calling.



In recent years, OnStar has developed a system based on the findings of a Center for Disease Control and Prevention expert panel which allows OnStar advisors to alert first responders when a vehicle crash is likely to have caused serious injury to the occupants. OnStar also launched a mobile application leveraging OnStar's unique connection to the vehicle to provide OnStar subscribers with up-to-date vehicle information such as oil level, tire pressure and fuel level as well as providing remote start, remote door unlock and navigation services from a mobile phone.



Product Development



Our vehicle development activities are integrated into a single global organization. This strategy builds on earlier efforts to consolidate and standardize our approach to vehicle development. We define a global architecture as a specific range of performance characteristics and dimensions supporting a common set of major underbody components and subsystems with common interfaces.



A centralized organization is responsible for many of the non-visible parts of the vehicle such as steering, suspension, the brake system, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system and the electrical system. This team works very closely with the global architecture development teams around the world, who are responsible for components that are unique to each brand, such as exterior and interior design, tuning of the vehicle to meet the brand character requirements and final validation to meet applicable government requirements.



Intellectual Property



We generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business. While none of these patents by itself is material to our business as a whole, these patents are very important to our operations and continued technological development. We hold a number of trademarks and service marks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace.



Raw Materials, Services and Supplies



We purchase a wide variety of raw materials, parts, supplies, energy, freight, transportation and other services from numerous suppliers for use in the manufacture of our products. The raw materials are primarily composed of steel, aluminum, resins, copper,






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



lead and platinum group metals. We have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry substantial inventories of such raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our production requirements.



In some instances, we purchase systems, components, parts and supplies from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. The inability or unwillingness of these sources to supply us with parts and supplies could have a material adverse effect on our production capacity. Purchases from our two largest suppliers have ranged from approximately 10% to 11% of our total purchases from 2010 to 2012.



Environmental and Regulatory Matters



Automotive Emissions Control



We are subject to laws and regulations that require us to control automotive emissions, including vehicle exhaust emission standards, vehicle evaporative emission standards and onboard diagnostic (OBD) system requirements. Advanced OBD systems are used to identify and diagnose problems with emission control systems. Problems detected by the OBD system may increase warranty costs and the chance for recall. Emission and OBD requirements become more challenging each year as vehicles must meet lower emission standards and new diagnostics are required and will continue to become even more stringent throughout the world.



North America



The federal government imposes stringent emission control requirements on vehicles sold in the U.S. and additional requirements are imposed by various state governments. These requirements include pre-production testing of vehicles, testing of vehicles after assembly, the imposition of emission defect and performance warranties and the obligation to recall and repair vehicles that do not comply with emissions requirements. We must obtain certification that the vehicles will meet emission requirements from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before we can sell vehicles in the U.S. and Canada and from the California Air Resources Board (CARB) before we can sell vehicles in California and other states that have adopted the California emissions requirements.



We believe that our vehicles meet the current EPA and CARB requirements. If our vehicles do not comply with the emission standards or if defective emission control systems or components are discovered in such testing, or as part of government required defect reporting, we could incur substantial costs related to emissions recalls and possible fines. We expect that new CARB and federal requirements will increase the time and mileage periods over which manufacturers are responsible for a vehicle's emission performance.



Fleet-wide compliance with current EPA and CARB emission standards must be achieved based on a sales-weighted fleet average. CARB has adopted its next round of emission requirements which phase in with the 2015 model year. These requirements include more stringent exhaust emission and evaporative emission standards. The EPA is also developing similar requirements which if adopted are expected to phase in with the 2017 model year. Both the EPA and the CARB have enacted regulations to control the emissions of greenhouse gases. Since we believe these regulations are effectively a form of fuel economy requirement, they are discussed under “Automotive Fuel Economy.”



California law requires that 12% of 2013 model year cars and certain light-duty trucks sold in the state must be zero emission vehicles (ZEV) such as electric vehicles or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. The requirement is based on a complex system of credits that vary in magnitude by vehicle type and model year. Manufacturers have the option of meeting a portion of this requirement with partial ZEV credit for vehicles that meet very stringent exhaust and evaporative emission standards and have extended emission system warranties. Additional portions of the ZEV requirement can be met with vehicles that meet these partial ZEV requirements and incorporate advanced technology such as hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric propulsion systems meeting specified criteria. We are complying with the ZEV requirements using a variety of means including producing vehicles certified to the partial ZEV requirements. CARB has adopted 2018 model year and later requirements for increasing volumes of ZEVs to achieve greenhouse gas as well as criteria pollutant emission reductions to help achieve the state's long-term greenhouse gas reduction goals. A portion of this requirement may be met with PHEVs that meet specified criteria including an extended emission system warranty.



The Clean Air Act permits states that have areas with air quality compliance issues to adopt the California car and light-duty truck emission standards in lieu of the federal requirements. Twelve states as well as the Province of Quebec currently have these standards in effect. One state has adopted those standards beginning in the 2014 model year and additional states could also adopt the California standards in the future.






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES





Vehicles equipped with heavy-duty engines are also subject to stringent emission requirements and could be recalled or fines could be imposed against us should testing or defect reporting identify noncompliance with emission requirements. We also certify heavy-duty engines for installation in other manufacturers' products. The heavy-duty exhaust standards became more stringent in the 2010 model year. We are using a system of credits to help meet these stringent standards as permitted by EPA and CARB regulations. OBD requirements were first applied to heavy-duty vehicles beginning with the 2010 model year, which we are meeting with certain hardware and software changes.



Europe



Emissions are regulated by two different entities: the European Commission (EC) and the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE). The EC imposes harmonized emission control requirements on vehicles sold in all 27 European Union (EU) Member States and other countries apply regulations under the framework of the UNECE. EU Member States can give tax incentives to automobile manufacturers for vehicles which meet emission standards earlier than the compliance date. We must demonstrate that vehicles will meet emission requirements in witness tests and type approval from an approval authority before we can sell vehicles in the EU Member States. Type approval requires the manufacturer to provide a representative vehicle to the evaluating agency who then determines if the particular type of vehicle is fully compliant with the applicable regulations. The regulatory requirements include random testing of newly assembled vehicles and a manufacturer in-use surveillance program. EU and UNECE requirements are equivalent in terms of stringency and implementation.



A new level of exhaust emission standards for cars and light-duty trucks, Euro 5, was effective in 2011. Future European emission standards focus particularly on further reducing emissions from diesel vehicles. The new Euro 6 emission levels will become effective in 2014. The new requirements will require additional technologies and further increase the cost of diesel engines, which currently cost more than gasoline engines.  To comply with Euro 6 standards we expect that we will need to implement technologies identical to those being developed to meet U.S. emission standards. These technologies will put additional cost pressures on the already challenging European market for small- and mid-size diesel vehicles. Gasoline engines are also affected by the new requirements. The measures for gasoline vehicles that require technology to reduce exhaust pollutant emissions will have adverse effects on vehicle fuel economy which drives additional technology cost to maintain fuel economy.



The adoption of additional requirements of Euro 6 has been extended by the EC to 2017. In the long-term, notwithstanding the already low vehicle emissions in Europe, the EC will continue devising regulatory requirements on the emission test cycle, real driving emission, low temperature testing, fuel evaporation and OBD.



International Operations



China has implemented Euro 4 standards with European OBD requirements nationwide for newly registered vehicles. Beijing is expected to require many elements of Euro 5 standards for newly registered vehicles beginning in 2013 with additional elements of Euro 5 standards to be enforced beginning in 2014. Nationwide implementation of Euro 5 is expected between 2015 and 2017. For diesel-powered vehicles China has implemented Euro 4 standards for new type approvals of both light-duty diesel vehicles and all new registrations of heavy-duty diesel vehicles. Enforcement of Euro 4 standards for new diesel light-duty registrations has been delayed until 2013.



South Korea has implemented the Euro 5 emission standards with European OBD requirements for diesel-powered vehicles, and the CARB standards for gasoline/LPG-powered vehicles. Commencing in 2014 new type-approvals will require the vehicle to meet Euro 6 diesel standards. The government is also considering the introduction of amendments to the low-emission vehicle program, LEVIII of the CARB standards, for gasoline/LPG-powered vehicles, with the planned implementation in 2016.



South America



Certain countries follow the U.S. test procedures, standards and OBD requirements and others follow the EU test procedures, standards and OBD requirements with different levels of stringency. Brazil implemented national L5 low emission vehicle standards for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in 2009. L6 standards for light diesel vehicles were implemented in 2012 and mandate OBD installation for light diesel vehicles in 2015. L6 standards for light gasoline vehicles are to be implemented in 2014 for new vehicles and 2015 for all models. Argentina implemented Euro 4 standards starting with new vehicle registrations in 2009 and the implementation of Euro 5 standards has been delayed from 2012 to 2014 for new vehicles and from 2014 to 2016 for all vehicles. Chile has enforced Euro 5 or U.S. Tier 2 Bin 5 emission standards for diesel vehicles and will implement Euro 5 or U.S. Tier 2 Bin 5 standards for gasoline vehicles in September 2014.

Industrial Environmental Control



Environmental Matters



Our operations are subject to a wide range of environmental protection laws including those laws regulating air emissions, water discharges, waste management and environmental cleanup. Certain environmental statutes require that responsible parties fund remediation actions regardless of fault, legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. Under certain circumstances these laws impose joint and several liability as well as liability for related damages to natural resources.



The future effect of environmental matters including potential liabilities is often difficult to estimate. AtDecember 31, 2012our accruals for environmental liabilities were$166 millionwhich is expected to be paid out over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites. Remediation periods typically range from five to 30 years.



Site Remediation



The following table summarizes the expenditures for site-remediation actions including ongoing operations and maintenance (dollars in millions):

Years Ended December 31,201220112010Site remediation expenditures$25$33$19



It is possible that such remediation actions could require average annual expenditures of $30 million over the next five years.



However, currently unidentified remediation costs and other damages for which we ultimately may be responsible cannot be determined with specificity because of uncertainties with respect to factors such as our connection to the site or to materials located at the site, the involvement of other potentially responsible parties, the application of laws and other standards or regulations, site conditions and the nature and scope of investigations, studies and remediation to be undertaken (including the technologies to be required and the extent, duration and success of remediation). As a result we are unable to determine with specificity the total amount of costs or other damages for which we are potentially responsible in connection with all sites although that total could be substantial.



Facility Management



To mitigate the effects our worldwide facilities have on the environment we are committed to convert as many of our worldwide facilities as possible to landfill-free facilities. At December 31, 2012 84 (or over 50%) of our manufacturing facilities were landfill-free facilities. Additionally we have 20 non-manufacturing facilities that are landfill free. At our landfill-free facilities approximately 97% of waste materials are recycled or reused and 3% is converted to energy at waste-to-energy facilities. Including construction, demolition and remediation wastes, we estimate that we recycled or reused over 2 million metric tons of waste materials at our global manufacturing operations and estimate that we converted approximately 61,000 metric tons of waste materials to energy at waste-to-energy facilities in the year ended December 31, 2012.



We continue to make progress on our 2020 Manufacturing Commitment to reduce total waste on a kg/vehicle basis by 10%, having reduced total waste by over 1.5 kg/vehicle in 2012 from our 2010 baseline (exclusive of metals and foundry-related wastes) and more than a 30 kg/vehicle reduction including metals and foundry-related wastes.



In addition to providing environmental benefits our landfill-free program and total waste reduction commitments help to reduce the risks and financial liabilities associated with waste disposal.



We continue to implement our global energy strategy with a goal to increase our green power purchases and improve our energy efficiency. Our data collection and management system is designed to monitor and measure energy use as well as calculate the related CO2emissions including collecting and verifying energy, water and other environmental data from our facilities. Our approach to manage our greenhouse gas emissions includes a global process to collect accurate data, internal and external targets and publicly reporting progress against the established targets.



Automotive Fuel Economy






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES





North America



Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) reporting is required for three separate fleets: domestically produced cars, imported cars and light-duty trucks. Beginning with the 2011 model year both car and light-duty truck standards were established using targets for various vehicle sizes and vehicle model sales volumes. In2012our domestic car standard was estimated to be 32.3 mpg and our light-duty truck standard was estimated to be 23.8 mpg. We do not have an import car fleet for 2012. Our current product plan is expected to be compliant with the federal CAFE program.



In August 2012 the EPA and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) finalized a coordinated national program consisting of new requirements for the 2017 through 2025 model year light-duty vehicles that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve fuel economy. This regulation represents a continuation of the national program that has been established for the 2012 through 2016 model year light-duty vehicles. This program includes EPA and NHTSA standards that will require an industry-wide target standard of 250 grams of carbon-related exhaust emissions per mile and 34.1 mpg by 2016. Our current product plan projects compliance with both federal programs through 2016.



The CARB regulates greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles (which is the same as regulating fuel economy). This California program is currently established for the 2009 through 2016 model years. CARB has agreed that compliance with the federal program is deemed to be compliant with the California program for the 2012 through 2016 model years.



A Canadian governmental agency implemented greenhouse gas standards that were harmonized with U.S. standards beginning with the 2011 model year. However these regulations do not require the separation of car fleet into domestic and import vehicles.



The Province of Quebec had previously adopted standards for the 2009 through 2016 model years that were equivalent to the California program but has revised their regulations to allow compliance with the national standards effective with the 2012 model year.



Europe



Legislation was passed in 2009 to regulate vehicle CO2emissions which began in 2012. Based on a target function of CO2to vehicle weight, each automobile manufacturer must meet a specific sales-weighted fleet average target. This fleet average requirement began phasing in during 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. Automobile manufacturers can earn super-credits for the sales volume of vehicles having a specific CO2value of less than 50 grams CO2per kilometer. This is intended to encourage the early introduction of ultra-low CO2vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt and Opel Ampera by providing an additional incentive to reduce the CO2fleet average. Automobile manufacturers may gain credit of up to seven grams for eco-innovations for those technologies which improve real-world fuel economy but may not show in the test cycle, such as solar panels on vehicles. There is also a 5% credit for FlexFuel vehicles if more than 30% of refueling stations in an EU Member State sell E85. Further regulatory detail is being developed. The legislation sets a target of 95 grams CO2per kilometer for 2020 with an impact assessment required to further assess and develop this requirement. We are developing a compliance plan by adopting operational CO2targets for each market entry in Europe.



In 2011 the EU adopted a standard to regulate CO2emissions from light commercial vehicles. This regulation is modeled after the CO2regulation for passenger cars. It proposes that new light commercial vehicles meet a fleet average CO2target of 175 grams CO2per kilometer with a phase in of compliance from 2014 and full compliance required by 2016. The manufacturer-specific CO2compliance target will be determined as a function of the weight of the vehicle with all standard equipment and fuel (vehicle curb weight). Flexibilities such as eco-innovations and super credits are part of the regulatory proposal as well. An EU long-term target for 2020 of 147 grams CO2per kilometer has been adopted for light commercial vehicles. We have developed a compliance plan by adopting operational CO2targets for each market entry in Europe.



In July 2012 the EU Commission released a regulatory proposal outlining the regulatory implementation of the 95g/km (passenger cars) and 147g/km (light commercial vehicles) targets effective in 2020. The individual manufacturer targets will continue to be determined based on the average vehicle mass. Other compliance flexibilities have been limited adding additional challenges to compliance with the CO2fleet target. We are assessing the impacts of limited flexibilities on our compliance plan. We are involved in the debate as the political discussion unfolds.



Effective in November 2012 an EC regulation required low-rolling resistance tires, tire pressure monitoring systems and gear shift indicators, which we adopted in 2011. An additional EC regulation has been adopted that will require labeling of tires for






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



noise, fuel efficiency and rolling resistance, affecting vehicles at the point of sale as well as the sale of tires in the aftermarket.



Seventeen EU Member States have introduced fuel consumption or CO2based vehicle taxation schemes. Tax measures are within the jurisdiction of the EU Member States. We are faced with significant challenges relative to the predictability of future tax laws and differences in the tax schemes and thresholds.



International Operations



We face new or increasingly more stringent fuel economy standards in many countries. China has established new Phase 3 fuel economy standards supplementing the current Phase 2 pass-fail system with a corporate fleet average scheme based on vehicle curb weight for the 2012 through 2015 model years. Implementation began in 2012 with full compliance required by 2015. China has continued its retail subsidies for consumers for fuel efficient vehicles, extended range and plug-in, battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. China is now working on a more aggressive Phase 4 fuel economy standard that is expected to apply to the 2016 through 2020 model years.



In Korea fuel economy/CO2targets for 2012 through 2015 were implemented as part of the government's low carbon/green growth strategy. These targets are based on each vehicle's curb weight and in general are set at levels more stringent than fuel economy targets in the U.S. but less stringent than CO2targets in the EU. The targets began being phased in during 2012 with full compliance by 2015 with manufacturers having the option to certify based on either fuel consumption or CO2emissions. Each manufacturer has been given a corporate target to meet based on its overall industry fleet fuel economy/CO2average. GM Korea's current product portfolio is expected to comply with the targets by 2015. However, in 2013 the Korean government plans to set more stringent fuel economy targets for 2016 and beyond that will likely reach the level in Japan by 2020 and the level in the EU by 2025.



In Australia the government is planning to adopt attribute-based CO2standards beginning in 2015 with standards expected to become more stringent through 2020.



South America



In Brazil governmental bodies and the automobile manufacturers association established a national voluntary program for evaluation and labeling of light passenger and commercial vehicles equipped with internal combustion gasoline engines. This voluntary program aims to increase vehicle energy efficiency by labeling vehicles with fuel consumption measurements for urban, extra-urban and combined (equivalent to city and highway mpg measurements in the U.S.) driving conditions.



In October 2012 the Brazilian government issued a decree which will provide indirect tax incentives, beginning January 1, 2013, to eligible participant companies that meet certain energy efficiency targets. The level of potential indirect tax incentives varies based on the degree and timing to which the targets are met. To the extent targets are not met, penalties and interest will be levied and no indirect tax incentives will be available.



In Chile starting in February 2013 every new vehicle with no more than eight seats is required to be tested in order to determine its reference values to be included in the new mandatory fuel economy label. As a result of this process, the label indicates the fuel consumption values for city, highway and combined city-highway and the CO2emission values.



Chemical Regulations



North America



Governmental agencies in both the U.S. and Canada continue to introduce new regulations and legislation related to the selection and use of safer chemical alternatives, green chemistry, life cycle assessment, and product stewardship initiatives. These initiatives will give broad regulatory authority to ban or restrict the use of certain chemical substances and potentially affect automobile manufacturers' responsibilities for vehicle life-cycle, including chemical substance selection for product development and manufacturing. These emerging regulations will potentially lead to increases in costs and supply chain complexity.



Europe



In 2007 the EU implemented its regulatory requirements, EU REACH regulation, to register, evaluate, authorize and restrict the use of chemical substances. This regulation requires chemical substances manufactured in or imported into the EU in quantities






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



of one metric ton or more per year to be registered with the European Chemicals Agency before 2018. During the pre-registration phase, Old GM and its suppliers registered those substances identified by this regulation. It is to be phased-in over a 10-year period. Under this regulation, “substances of very high concern” may either require authorization for further use or may be restricted in the future. This could potentially increase the cost of certain alternative substances that are used to manufacture vehicles and parts, or result in a supply chain disruption when a substance is no longer available to meet production timelines. Our research and development initiatives may be diverted to address future requirements.



We continually monitor the implementation of chemical regulations to maintain compliance and evaluate their effect on our business, suppliers, and the automotive industry.



Safety



In the U.S. if a vehicle or vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard or if a vehicle defect creates an unreasonable safety risk the manufacturer is required to notify owners and provide a remedy. We are required to report certain information relating to certain customer complaints, warranty claims, field reports and notices and claims involving property damage, injuries and fatalities in the U.S. and claims involving fatalities outside the U.S. We are also required to report certain information concerning safety recalls and other safety campaigns outside the U.S.



Outside the U.S. safety standards and recall regulations often have the same purpose as the U.S. standards but may differ in their requirements and test procedures. Other countries sometimes pass regulations which are more stringent than U.S. standards. Many countries require type approval while the U.S. and Canada require self-certification.



Vehicular Noise Control



In the U.S. passenger cars and light-duty trucks are subject to state and local motor vehicle noise regulations. We identify the most stringent state and local requirements and validate to those requirements. Medium to heavy-duty trucks are regulated at the federal level. Federal truck regulations preempt all U.S. state or local noise regulations for trucks over a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 lbs.



Outside the U.S. noise regulations have been established by authorities at the national and supranational level (e.g., EC or UNECE). We believe that our vehicles meet all applicable noise regulations in the markets where they are sold. The EC has proposed new noise regulations that would mandate a significant decrease in vehicle noise emissions. These proposals are coupled with a new test procedure to better estimate the actual in-use noise emission of vehicles. The proposals of the EC also form the basis for amendment to UNECE vehicle regulations, with the expected effect that maximum noise regulations will become more stringent in all markets outside of North America. At this point, the final noise emission levels as well as the implementation timing of the final regulations are uncertain.



While current noise emission requirements regulate maximum allowable noise levels, formal proposals are under development to regulate minimum sound levels. These proposals stem from concern that relatively quiet vehicles, specifically hybrids and electrics, may not be readily heard by pedestrians. In the United States, NHTSA has issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on January 14, 2013 and is required to issue a final regulation for the minimum level of sound for hybrid and electric vehicles by January 2014. The UNECE is developing a Global Technical Regulation, sponsored by the United States, Japan, and the EU, for manufacturers to equip vehicles with pedestrian alerting devices where the vehicle fails to meet minimum sound emission levels.



We are committed to designing and manufacturing vehicles to comply with these regulations and potential noise emission regulations that may come from these proposals.



Potential Effect of Regulations



We are actively working on aggressive near-term and long-term plans to develop and bring to market technologies designed to further reduce emissions, mitigate remediation expenses related to environmental liabilities, improve fuel efficiency, monitor and enhance the safety features of our vehicles and provide additional value and benefits to our customers. This is illustrated by our commitment to marketing more hybrid vehicles, our accelerated commitment to developing electrically powered vehicles, our use of biofuels in our expanded portfolio of FlexFuel vehicles and enhancements to conventional internal combustion engine technology which have contributed to the fuel efficiency of our vehicles. The conversion of many of our manufacturing facilities to landfill-free status has shown our commitment to mitigate potential environmental liability. We believe that the development and global implementation of new, cost-effective energy technologies in all sectors is the most effective way to improve energy efficiency,






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate environmental liabilities.



Despite these advanced technology efforts, our ability to satisfy fuel economy, CO2and other emissions requirements is contingent on various future economic, consumer, legislative and regulatory factors that we cannot control or predict with certainty. If we are not able to comply with specific new requirements, which include higher CAFE standards and state CO2requirements such as those which require the CARB to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles, then we could be subject to sizeable civil penalties or have to restrict product offerings drastically to remain in compliance. Environmental liabilities for which we may be responsible are not reasonably estimable and could be substantial. Violations of safety or emissions standards could result in the recall of one or more of our products. In turn any of these actions could have substantial adverse effects on our operations including facility idling, reduced employment, increased costs and loss of revenue.



Pension Legislation



We are subject to a variety of U.S. federal rules and regulations including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended and the Pension Protection Act of 2006 which govern the manner in which we fund and administer our pension plans. In July 2012 the U.S. government enacted the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act which allows plan sponsors funding relief for U.S. pension plans through the application of higher funding interest rates. As a result, under current economic conditions, we expect the new law to further delay required contributions to our U.S. pension plans. The new law does not impact our reported funded status or funding contemplated under our derisking initiatives.



Export Control



We are subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations and most countries in which we do business have applicable export controls. Our Office of Export Compliance and our global Export Compliance Officers are responsible for working with our business units to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations.



Automotive Financing - GM Financial



GM Financial (formerly AmeriCredit Corp.) which we acquired on October 1, 2010 for cash of $3.5 billion is our captive automotive finance company that has been operating since 1992. GM Financial purchases automobile finance contracts for new and used vehicles purchased by consumers primarily from franchised and select independent dealerships. GM Financial predominantly offers financing to consumers who are typically unable to obtain financing from more traditional sources. The typical borrower has experienced prior credit difficulties or has limited credit history and generally has a credit bureau score ranging from 500 through 700. GM Financial services its loan portfolio at regional centers using automated loan servicing and collection systems. Since GM Financial provides financing in a relatively high-risk market it expects to sustain a higher level of credit losses than other more traditional sources of financing.



GM Financial finances its loan origination volume through the use of credit facilities and securitization trusts that issue asset-backed securities to investors. GM Financial retains an interest in these securitization trusts that are over collateralized whereby more receivables are transferred to the securitization trusts than the amount of asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts as well as the estimated future excess cash flows expected to be received by GM Financial over the life of the securitization. Excess cash flows result from the difference between the finance charges received from the obligors on the receivables and the interest paid to investors in the asset-backed securities net of credit losses and expenses.



Excess cash flows in the securitization trusts are initially utilized to fund credit enhancement requirements in order to attain specific credit ratings for the asset-backed securities issued by the securitization trusts. Once targeted credit enhancement requirements are reached and maintained excess cash flows are distributed to GM Financial or, in a securitization utilizing a senior subordinated structure, may be used to accelerate the repayment of certain subordinated securities. In addition to excess cash flows GM Financial receives monthly base servicing fees and collects other fees such as late charges as servicer for securitization trusts.



In November 2012 GM Financial entered into an agreement with Ally Financial to acquire Ally Financial's automotive finance and financial services operations in Europe and Latin America. Additionally in November 2012 GM Financial entered into a share transfer agreement with Ally Financial to acquire Ally Financial's equity interest in GMAC-SAIC Automotive Finance Company Limited (GMAC-SAIC) that conducts automotive finance and financial services operations in China. The purchases will allow GM Financial to support our dealers in markets comprising 80% of our global sales. The combined consideration will be approximately $4.2 billion, subject to certain possible closing adjustments. Pursuant to the transactions GM Financial's assets are expected to double to approximately $33.0 billion and its liabilities, including consolidated debt, will increase to approximately






Table of ContentsGENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES



$27.0 billion compared with$11.8 billionat December 31, 2012. The closings of the transactions are expected to occur in stages throughout 2013.



In April 2012 GM Financial commenced commercial lending activities in the U.S. centered on floor plan financing of dealer vehicle inventory and dealer loans to finance dealer sites, facilities, facility improvements and working capital. These loans are made on a secured basis. We believe the availability of financing for our dealers is important to our business. GM Financial plans to launch similar commercial lending in Canada during the first half of 2013.



In April 2011 GM Financial began originating leases for our customers in Canada via FinanciaLinx Corporation. Given the importance of leasing and the previous lack of availability of leasing offerings to our customers in the Canadian market (due to regulatory restrictions preventing banks and bank holding companies from offering leasing in Canada), we believe having a captive financing offering in Canada is strategically important to our business. In August 2012 GM Financial began offering consumer sub-prime financing in Canada.



In December 2010 GM Financial began offering a lease product in certain geographic areas through our franchised dealerships that targets consumers with prime credit bureau scores leasing new GM vehicles. During 2011 GM Financial completed the nationwide rollout of the lease product in the U.S. including separate product offerings for prime and sub-prime customers. GM Financial continues to expand its business in targeted areas that it views as strategic and to otherwise evaluate opportunities in specific segments of the automotive financing market.
