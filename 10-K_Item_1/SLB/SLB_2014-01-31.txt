Item 1.Business.

All references in this report to “Registrant,” “Company,” “Schlumberger,” “we” or “our” are to Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V., incorporated in Curaçao) and its consolidated subsidiaries.



Founded in 1926, Schlumberger is the world’s leading supplier of technology, integrated project management and information solutions to the international oil and gas exploration and production industry. Having invented wireline logging as a technique for obtaining downhole data in oil and gas wells, Schlumberger today provides the industry’s widest range of products and services from exploration through production. As of December 31, 2013, the Company employed approximately 123,000 people of over 140 nationalities operating in approximately 85 countries. Schlumberger has principal executive offices in Paris, Houston and The Hague.



Schlumberger operates in each of the major oilfield service markets, managing its business through three Groups: Reservoir Characterization, Drilling and Production.  Each Group consists of a number of technology-based service and product lines, or Technologies.  These Technologies cover the entire life cycle of the reservoir and correspond to a number of markets in which Schlumberger holds leading positions.  The business is also reported through four geographic Areas: North America, Latin America, Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East & Asia. Within these Areas, a network of GeoMarket* regions provides logistical, technical and commercial coordination.



The role of the Groups and Technologies is to ensure that Schlumberger provides the best possible service to customers and that it remains at the forefront of technology development.  The Groups and Technologies are collectively responsible for driving excellence in execution throughout their businesses, overseeing operational processes, resource allocation, personnel and delivering superior financial results. The GeoMarket structure offers customers a single point of contact at the local level for field operations and brings together geographically focused teams to meet local needs and deliver customized solutions. The Areas and GeoMarkets are responsible for providing the most efficient and cost effective support possible to the operations.



The Groups are as follows:

Schlumberger has a 40% equity ownership interest in OneSubseaTM, a joint venture with Cameron International Corporation (“Cameron”).  The joint venture manufactures and develops products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market.  Schlumberger’s 40% share of the net income of the joint venture is reflected in the results of the Production Group.

Schlumberger also offers customers its services through business models known as Integrated Project Management (IPM), for well construction projects, and Schlumberger Production Management (SPM), for field production projects. These models combine the required services and products of the Technologies with drilling rig management, specialized engineering and project management expertise to provide a complete solution to well construction and production improvement.



IPM projects are typically of multiyear duration and include start-up costs and significant third-party components that cover services that Schlumberger does not provide directly.  Projects may be fixed price in nature and may contain penalties for non-performance.



SPM commercial arrangements create alignment between Schlumberger and the asset holder and/or the operator whereby Schlumberger receives remuneration in line with its value creation.  These projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of Schlumberger’s customers’ mature assets under long-term agreements.  Schlumberger will invest its own services and products, and in some cases cash into the asset.  Schlumberger is generally not paid for services and products at the time of providing the services or upon delivery of the products.  Instead, Schlumberger is generally compensated on a fee-per-barrel basis for any incremental production Schlumberger helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.



Supporting the Technologies is a global network of research and engineering centers. Through this organization, Schlumberger is committed to advanced technology programs that enhance oilfield efficiency, lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity, maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value while accomplishing these goals in a safe and environmentally sound manner.



Managed outside the Group structure is Schlumberger Business Consulting, which helps oil and gas companies achieve fast and sustainable performance improvements.



Schlumberger primarily uses its own personnel to market its offerings. The customer base, business risks and opportunities for growth are essentially uniform across all services. There is a sharing of manufacturing and engineering facilities as well as research centers, and the labor force is interchangeable. Technological innovation, quality of service and price differentiation are the principal methods of competition, which varies geographically with respect to the different services offered. While there are numerous competitors, both large and small, Schlumberger believes that it is an industry leader in providing wireline logging, well testing, drilling and completion fluids, coiled-tubing, drill bits,  measurement-while-drilling, logging-while-drilling and directional drilling services, mud logging, as well as fully computerized logging and geoscience software and computing services. A large proportion of Schlumberger offerings is non-rig related; consequently, revenue does not necessarily correlate to rig count fluctuations.




GENERAL

Intellectual Property

Schlumberger and its affiliates own and control a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to Schlumberger’s business. While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is considered material to Schlumberger’s business.

Seasonality

Seasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of oilfield services. For example, the spring thaw in Canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia and China can produce severe weather conditions which typically result in reduced levels of activity. Hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations. Additionally, customer spending patterns for multiclient data, software and other oilfield services and products generally result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of each year as clients seek to utilize their annual budgets.

Customers and Backlog of Orders

For the year ended December 31, 2013, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue. Other than WesternGeco, Schlumberger has no significant backlog due to the nature of its businesses. The WesternGeco backlog, which is based on signed contracts with customers, was $0.9 billion at December 31, 2013 ($1.0 billion at December 31, 2012).

Financial Information

Financial information by business segment and geographic area for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 is provided in Note 17 of theConsolidated Financial Statements.
