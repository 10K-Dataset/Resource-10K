ITEM 1-BUSINESS

We are a leading manufacturer of water heaters and boilers, serving a diverse mix of residential and commercial end markets principally in the United States
(U.S.) with a strong and growing international presence. Our company is comprised of two reporting segments: North America and Rest of World. Our Rest of World segment is primarily comprised of China, Europe and India. Both segments manufacture and
market comprehensive lines of residential gas, gas tankless and electric water heaters and commercial water heating equipment. Both segments primarily serve their respective regions of the world. The North America segment also manufactures and
markets specialty commercial water heating equipment, condensing and non-condensing boilers and water systems tanks. The Rest of World segment also manufactures and markets water treatment products, primarily for Asia.

On August 22, 2011, we sold our Electrical Products business (EPC) to Regal Beloit Corporation (RBC) for approximately $760 million in cash and
approximately 2.83 million shares of RBC common stock valued at $140.6 million as of that date. Due to the sale, EPC has been reflected as a discontinued operation in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented. For further
information about EPC, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

The following table summarizes our sales from continuing operations. This
summary and all other information presented in this section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which appear in Item 8 in this document.

NORTH AMERICA

In
our North America segment, sales increased 6.2 percent or $89.2 million in 2013 compared with the prior year. Higher volumes of U.S. residential and commercial water heaters and boilers, partially offset by lower volumes of Canadian water heaters
are the primary reasons for an increase in sales compared with the prior year. Our Lochinvar brand, which we acquired in August 2011, incrementally added $142.9 million to sales in 2012 compared to 2011. Approximately 40 percent of Lochinvar-branded
sales consist of residential and commercial water heaters while the remaining 60 percent of Lochinvar-branded sales consist primarily of boilers and related parts.

We serve residential and commercial end markets in North America with a broad range of products including:

Gas, gas tankless, and electric water heaters. Our residential and commercial water heaters come in sizes ranging from 2.5 gallon (point-of-use) models
to 12,500 gallon appliances with varying efficiency ranges. We offer electric, natural gas and liquid propane models as well as gas tankless and solar tank units for energy efficient homes. Our North American residential water heater sales in 2013
were approximately $950 million or 63 percent of North America revenues. Typical applications for our water heaters include residences, restaurants, hotels and motels, laundries, car washes and small businesses.

Boilers.Our residential and commercial boilers range in size from 40,000 British Thermal Units (BTUs) to 5.0 million BTUs. Our commercial boilers
are used primarily in space heating applications including hospitals, schools, hotels and other large commercial buildings.

Other.Our North
America segment also manufactures expansion tanks, commercial solar water heating systems, swimming pool and spa heaters, and related products and parts.

A significant portion of the segment’s business is derived from the replacement of existing products, and we believe that since 2008, the sale of
products to the North America residential new housing construction market has represented less than ten percent of our North America residential water heater sales.

We are the largest manufacturer and marketer of water heaters in North America, and we have a leading share in both the residential and commercial markets. In
the commercial market, we believe our comprehensive product line including boilers and our high-efficiency products give us a competitive advantage in this portion of the water heating industry. Our wholesale distribution channel includes more than
1,200 independent wholesale plumbing distributors with more than 4,400 selling






locations serving residential and commercial end markets. We also sell our residential water heaters through the retail channel. In this channel, our customers include five of the seven largest
national hardware and home center chains, including long-standing exclusive branding relationships with both Lowe’s and Sears. Our boiler distribution channel is primarily comprised of manufacturer representative firms.

We acquired Lochinvar in 2011 for approximately $435 million including an earn-out provision that resulted in a payment of $13.5 million in December 2012. Our
Lochinvar brand is one of the leading brands of residential and commercial boilers in the U.S.

Our energy efficient product offerings continue to be a
sales driver of our business. Our Cyclone product family and our commercial boilers continue to be an option for commercial customers looking for high efficiency water and space heating with a short payback period through energy savings. We offer
residential heat pump and solar water heaters in North America, as well as other higher efficiency water heating solutions to round out our energy efficient product offerings.

We sell our water heating products in highly competitive markets. We compete in each of our targeted market segments based on product design, quality of
products and services, performance and price. Our principal water heating and boiler competitors in North America include Rheem, Bradford White, Rinnai, Navien, Aerco and Cleaver-Brooks. Numerous other manufacturing companies also compete.

REST OF WORLD

Sales in our Rest of World segment
increased 23.1 percent, or $125.5 million, in 2013 compared with the prior year. A 26.1 percent increase in sales of A. O. Smith branded products in China to $565.2 million was the primary source of the increase in sales.

We have operated in China for almost 20 years. In that time, we have been aggressively expanding our presence while building A. O. Smith brand recognition in
the Chinese residential and commercial markets. The Chinese market is predominantly comprised of electric wall-hung, solar and gas tankless water heaters. We believe we are one of the leading suppliers of water heaters to the residential market in
China, with a broad product offering including electric, gas, gas tankless, heat pump and solar units. We also manufacture and market water treatment products primarily in the residential market.

We sell water heaters in more than 5,900 retail outlets in China, of which over 1,200 exclusively sell our products. In addition, our water treatment products
are sold in 2,900 retail outlets in China.

In 2008, we established a sales office in India and began importing products specifically designed for India
from our Nanjing, China facility. We began manufacturing water heaters in India in the second quarter of 2010. Our sales in India were $20.3 million in 2013, essentially the same as in 2012.

Our primary competitor in China is Haier Appliances, a Chinese company, but we also compete with Midea in the electric water heater market and Rinnai and
Noritz in the gas tankless and solar water heater markets. Additionally, we compete with numerous other Chinese private and state-owned water heater and water treatment companies in China. In India, we compete with Bajaj, MTS-Racold, Venus and
numerous other companies.

In addition, we sell water heaters to the European and Middle Eastern markets and water treatment products in Turkey, all of
which comprised approximately eight percent of total Rest of World sales.

RAW MATERIAL

Raw materials for our manufacturing operations, primarily consisting of steel, are generally available in adequate quantities. A portion of our customers are
contractually obligated to accept price changes based on fluctuations in steel prices. There has been significant volatility in steel costs over the last several years.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

To improve competitiveness by
generating new products and processes, we conduct research and development at our Corporate Technology Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at our Global Engineering Center in Nanjing, China, and at our operating locations. Total expenditures for
research and development in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were $57.8 million, $51.7 million and $42.7 million, respectively.






PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own and use in our businesses various trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and licenses. We do not believe that our business as a whole is
materially dependent upon any such trademark, trade name, patent, trade secret or license. However, our trade name is important with respect to our products, particularly in China, India and the U.S.

EMPLOYEES

Our operations employed approximately 11,400
employees as of December 31, 2013, primarily non-union.

BACKLOG

Due to the short-cycle nature of our businesses, none of our operations sustain significant backlogs.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

Our operations are governed by a
variety of federal, foreign, state and local laws intended to protect the environment. Compliance with environmental laws has not had and is not expected to have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position of
our company. See Item 3.
