Item 1. Business.



Summary



Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores, automobiles and commercial aircraft. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 20 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing & Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.



Overview of Our Segments



Residential Furnishings Segment







Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.  Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.



Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves. In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.

Industrial Materials Segment





We believe that the quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing. Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills. We have four wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. Our Steel Tubing business unit also supplies nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing. In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.



On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western).  Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.  Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.  For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 104 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Strategic Direction



Key Financial Metric



Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price). Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.



We monitor our TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2012 we generated TSR of 16% per year, on average, which places us in the top 37% of the S&P 500. In addition, our TSR has exceeded that of the S&P 500 index for five consecutive years.



Our incentive programs reward return generation. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit’s direct control.








Table of ContentsPART I



Returning Cash to Shareholders



During the past three years, we generated $1.14 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR.



Since late 2007, we have raised quarterly dividends by 61%, from $.18 per share to $.29 per share currently.  Our dividend payout target is 50-60% of earnings; however we have been above that target in recent years.  Our dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) was 92%,106% and 67% in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively.  As our markets recover, we expect to move back into our target payout range. In the meantime, we expect to generate enough cash to continue to pay and modestly grow the dividend. The Company has consistently (for over 20 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.



We expect to use cash (after funding capital expenditures, dividends, and growth opportunities) for share repurchases.  During the past three years, we have repurchased 18.3 million shares of our stock (and issued 11.6 million shares through employee benefit plans), which reduced the net outstanding shares by 4.5%. In 2012, we repurchased 2.0 million shares (which includes shares withheld for taxes in option exercises and stock unit conversions; and forfeited stock units) at an average per share price of $25.35 (and issued 4.7 million shares through employee benefit plans).  As discussed in more detail below under “Acquisitions,” we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million in January 2012. As such, the level of share repurchases was lower in 2012 than in recent years and our shares outstanding rose by 2% to roughly 142 million at year-end.



Portfolio Management



We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), operating cash flows, and return on assets. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.



Disciplined Growth



Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity. First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.



Our long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We seek acquisitions within our growth businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable






Table of ContentsPART I



competitive advantage, and a strong fit with the Company; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return and have an internal rate of return in excess of 10%; (c) for stand-alone companies: generally, revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on companies: generally, revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.



Acquisitions



In January 2012, we acquired for a cash purchase price of $188 million, Western Pneumatic Tube, which produces thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products for aerospace applications.  Western fabricates products from specialty materials, such as titanium, nickel, stainless steel, and other high strength metals for use in aircraft systems and aircraft engine systems, including fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, life support, stability, and cooling systems.  Western operates two facilities, one in Kirkland, Washington, and another in Poway, California, and is part of our Industrial Materials segment.  For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 104 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



We had no significant acquisitions in 2010 and 2011.



Divestitures



There were no significant divestitures in 2011 or 2012.



We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment) in the third quarter of 2010. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit. Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.  This unit sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and health care industries.



For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 75 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Table of ContentsPART I



Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for components is growing. Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.



Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

•Foreign currency fluctuation

•Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights

•Credit risks

•Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates

•Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war

•Inconsistent interpretation and enforcement, at times, of foreign tax schemes

•Political instability in certain countries



Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 75% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.

Distribution of Products



In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.



Raw Materials



The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

•Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, coil, sheet, stainless and angle iron

•Foam scrap

•Woven and non-woven fabrics

•Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals



We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:

•Innersprings and foundations for mattresses

•Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas

•Automotive seating components



We supply the majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire. We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.

Customer Concentration



We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2012, our largest customer accounted for approximately 6% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 24% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing & Components and Specialized Products segments.



Patents and Trademarks



The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2012. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole. Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.







Some of our most significant trademarks include:

•Semi-Flex®(box spring components and foundations)

•Mira-Coil®, VertiCoil®, Lura-Flex®,Superlastic®andComfort Core®(mattress innersprings)

Research and Development



We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our other facilities. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of research and development to be approximately $20 million per year in each of the last three years.



Employees



As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately 18,300 employees, of which roughly 12,900 were engaged in production. Of the 18,300, approximately 8,600 were international employees (5,000 in China). Labor unions represented roughly 14% of our employees. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2012. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2013. The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.





As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 18,300 employees.



Competition



Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.



We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

•Components for residential furniture and bedding

•Carpet underlay

•Adjustable bed bases

•Components for office furniture

•Drawn steel wire

•Automotive seat support and lumbar systems

•Bedding industry machinery for wire forming, sewing and quilting

•Thin-walled, titanium, nickel and other specialty tubing for the aerospace industry






Table of ContentsPART I



We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.



Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%-15%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices. We expect these products to continue to grow. Some of our traditional bedding customers are now offering mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers comprised of specialty foam and gel. These hybrid products, which allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring, are being well received by consumers.



Since early 2009, there have been antidumping duty rates on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.  These rates are expected to remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.



Seasonality



As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses. Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.



•Residential Furnishings:typically does not exhibit any significant seasonality, except for a reduction in fourth quarter sales.

•Commercial Fixturing & Components:generally has modestly stronger third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the fourth quarter significantly lower. This aligns with the retail industry’s normal construction cycle—the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.

•Industrial Materials:minimal variation in sales throughout the year.

•Specialized Products:relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.



Backlog



Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.

Working Capital Items



For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of “Cash from Operations” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 39.



Government Contracts



The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from Government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any Government.



Environmental Regulation



Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.



Internet Access to Information



We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Discontinued Operations



Two of our prior businesses (the Storage Products business unit, which was previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment and the Prime Foam Products business unit, which was previously reported in the Residential Furnishing segment) are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses.



We divested the Storage Products business unit in the third quarter of 2010. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit. Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.  This unit sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and health care industries.



During the second quarter of 2012, we received a cash litigation settlement of $3.9 million related to our former Prime Foam Products unit, which was sold in March 2007.  This business unit produced foam primarily used for cushioning by upholstered furniture and bedding manufacturers.



For further information on these discontinued operations, see Note B on page 75 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
