Item 1. Business.



Summary



Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered components and products found in many homes, offices, automobiles and commercial aircraft. As discussed below, our continuing operations are organized into 18 business units, which are divided into 9 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings; Commercial Fixturing & Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.



Overview of Our Segments



Residential Furnishings Segment







Our Residential Furnishings segment began in 1883 with the manufacture of steel coiled bedsprings.  Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our customers a single source for many of their component needs.



Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials and machinery, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can produce themselves. In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.

Industrial Materials Segment





We believe that the quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire.  Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately 500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills. We have three wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. Our Steel Tubing business unit also supplies a portion of our internal needs for welded steel tubing. In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.



In 2012, we completed the acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube (Western).  Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and formed the Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group.  Western specializes in fabricating thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.  In 2013, we expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies. The first was a UK-based business that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication. The second was a French company that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio. For further information about acquisitions, see Note R on page 109 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Strategic Direction



Key Financial Metric



Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR = (Change in Stock Price + Dividends)/Beginning Stock Price. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 companies over rolling three-year periods through a balanced approach that employs four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion, dividends, and share repurchases.  For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2014 we generated TSR of 28% per year on average, which placed us in the top quarter of the S&P 500.



Our incentive programs reward return generation and profitable growth. Senior executives participate in a TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit’s direct control.



Returning Cash to Shareholders



During the past three years, we generated $1.25 billion of operating cash, and we returned much of this cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  Dividends and share repurchases are expected to remain significant contributors to long-term TSR.



We currently pay a quarterly dividend of $.31 per share.  Our dividend payout target is 50-60% of earnings; however we have been above that target in recent years.  Our dividend payout ratio (dividends declared per share/earnings per share) was 67%, 88% and 179% in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively. The earnings per share component of the dividend payout ratio was impacted by goodwill impairment charges in 2013 and 2014, and a litigation accrual in 2014. As our markets continue to recover, we expect to move into our target payout range. In the meantime, we expect to generate enough cash to continue to pay and modestly grow the dividend. The Company has consistently (for over 25 years) generated operating cash in excess of our annual requirement for capital expenditures and dividends.



We expect to use cash (after repayment of debt and funding capital expenditures, dividends, and growth opportunities) for share repurchases.  Share repurchases were significant in 2013 and 2014. During those two years, we repurchased a total of 11.4 million shares of our stock and issued 7.1 million shares through employee benefit and stock purchase plans. Consistent with our stated plans to repurchase fewer shares in years when acquisition spending is higher, our share repurchases in 2012 were much lower, given the $188 million we invested to acquire Western Pneumatic Tube. In that year, our outstanding shares increased as we repurchased 2.0 million shares and issued 4.7 million shares through employee programs. For the three years combined, we repurchased a total of 13.4 million shares of our stock and issued 11.8 million shares, reducing outstanding shares by 1.1%. In 2014, we repurchased 5.4 million shares (at an average of $33.76) and issued 3.9 million shares (at an average of $22.73). Issuances were largely related to employee stock option exercises.



Portfolio Management



We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help guide decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as growth of EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), operating cash flows, and return on assets. Business units in the






Table of ContentsPART I



Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.



Disciplined Growth



Long-term, we aim to achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To attain this goal, we will need to supplement the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity. First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms: opportunities in markets new to us containing margins and growth higher than the Company's average, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.



Our long-term 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We primarily seek acquisitions within our Grow businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a sustainable competitive advantage, a strong fit with the Company, and be in an attractive and growing market; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return; (c) for stand-alone businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on businesses: generally possess revenue in excess of $15 million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.



Acquisitions



In 2014, we purchased Tempur Sealy's three U.S. innerspring component production facilities for a purchase price of $44.5 million.  In conjunction with this purchase, we also expanded and extended our supply relationship and became the exclusive long-term provider in the U.S. and Canada of wire-based innersprings for Tempur Sealy, and boxsprings for Sealy.



We also acquired Kintec-Solution, a German designer and distributor of high-end, European-styled motion components which became part of our Furniture Hardware business for a purchase price of $16.8 million.  This business allows us to meet varying design preferences and broadens the range of our furniture component products.



In 2013, we expanded our Aerospace Products business unit with the acquisition of two companies. The first was a UK-based business acquired for $11.7 million that extended our capability in aerospace tube fabrication. The second was a French company acquired for $14.5 million that added small-diameter, high-pressure seamless tubing to our product portfolio.



In 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million and formed the Aerospace Products business unit.  Western produces thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel, stainless steel, and other high strength metals for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.

Divestitures



In 2014, we divested the majority of the Store Fixtures group for total consideration of $59 million. We continue to pursue the sale of the remaining portion of the group, which is classified as discontinued operations.  The Store Fixtures group was previously part of the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment.



There were no significant divestitures in 2012 or 2013.



For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 77 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where demand for components is growing. Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.



Our international operations face the risks associated with any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

•Foreign currency fluctuation

•Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights

•Credit risks

•Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates

•Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war

•Inconsistent interpretation and enforcement, at times, of foreign tax laws

•Political instability in certain countries



Our Specialized Products segment, which derives roughly 81% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.

Distribution of Products



In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition, operating cash flows or results of operations of the Company.



Raw Materials



The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

•Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, sheet, stainless and angle iron

•Foam scrap

•Woven and non-woven fabrics

•Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals



We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:

•Innersprings and foundations for mattresses

•Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas

•Automotive seating components



We supply a substantial majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our U.S. requirements for steel wire. We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.



Customer Concentration



We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many long-term business relationships. In 2014, our largest customer accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated continuing operations revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 27% of these consolidated continuing operations revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing & Components and Specialized Products segments.

Patents and Trademarks



The chart below shows the approximate number of patents issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our continuing operations as of December 31, 2014. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole. Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.







Some of our most significant trademarks include:

•Semi-Flex®(box spring components and foundations)

•ComfortCore®,Mira-Coil®, VertiCoil®, Lura-Flex®,andSuperlastic®(mattress innersprings)

•Active Support Technology®(mattress innersprings)

•Wall Hugger®(recliner chair mechanisms)

•Super Sagless®(motion and sofa sleeper mechanisms)

•No-Sag®(wire forms used in seating)

•Tack & Jump®andPattern Link®(quilting machines)

Product Development



One of our strongest performing product categories across the company is ComfortCore®, our fabric-encased spring coils used in hybrid and other mattresses.  Many mattress producers have moved to higher valued innersprings like ComfortCore®in more of their product lines, typically replacing foam cores or traditional innersprings.  Our ComfortCore®volume has doubled in just two years, representing 17% of our total U.S. innerspring units in 2014.

Research and Development



We maintain research, development and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and at many of our other facilities. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of research and development was $22 million in 2012, $24 million in 2013 and $26 million in 2014.



Employees



As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 19,000 employees in continuing operations, of which roughly 13,500 were engaged in production. Of the 19,000, approximately 9,600 were international employees (5,400 in China). Roughly 15% of our employees in continuing operations are represented by labor unions that collectively bargain for work conditions, wages or other issues. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2014. Management is not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2015. The chart below shows the approximate number of continuing operations employees by segment.









As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately 18,800 employees in continuing operations.



Competition



Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line, but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.  In general, our competitors tend to be smaller, private companies.



We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

•Components for residential furniture and bedding

•Carpet underlay

•Adjustable bed bases






Table of ContentsPART I



•Components for office furniture

•Drawn steel wire

•Automotive seat support and lumbar systems

•Bedding industry machinery

•Thin-walled, titanium, nickel and other specialty tubing for the aerospace industry

We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, logistics and distribution efficiencies, and large scale purchasing of raw materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.



Since 2009, there have been antidumping duty orders on innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam, ranging from 116% to 234%.In March 2014, the Department of Commerce (DOC) and the International Trade Commission (ITC) determined that the duties should be continued.  In April 2014, the DOC published its final order continuing the duties through February 2019 (for China) and December 2018 (for South Africa and Vietnam).  Also, a  case brought in January 2014 by major U.S. steel wire rod producers resulted in a ruling in December 2014, and the implementation of antidumping duties of 106% to 110% and countervailing duties of 178% to 193% on imports of Chinese steel wire rod through December 2019.



Because of the documented evasion of antidumping orders by certain importers, typically shipping goods through third countries and falsely identifying the countries of origin, Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers have formed a coalition and are working with members of Congress, the DOC, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or countervailing duty orders.



Seasonality



As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not experienced significant seasonality. However, unusual economic factors in any given year, along with acquisitions and dispositions, can create sales variability and obscure the underlying seasonality of our businesses. Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third quarters typically have slightly higher sales, while the first and fourth quarters have generally been lower.  Segment level seasonality has also been relatively limited, however the Residential Furnishings segment usually has lower sales in the fourth quarter and the Specialized Products segment typically experiences lower sales in the third quarter.



Backlog



Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.



Working Capital Items



For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of “Cash from Operations” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 38.














Table of ContentsPART I



Government Contracts



The Company does not have a material amount of sales derived from government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any government.



Environmental Regulation



Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.



Internet Access to Information



We routinely post information for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating & Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section. Information contained on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Discontinued Operations



For the periods presented, we classified some of our businesses as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been or will be eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have either been disposed of or are classified as held for sale; and (iii) we will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the businesses after the disposal transactions.



A substantial portion of our Store Fixtures business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2014.  It has been classified as a discontinued operation. This business designed, produced, installed and managed customers' store fixture projects. It manufactured custom-designed, full store fixture packages for retailers, including shelving, counters, showcases and garment racks. It also produced standard shelving used by large retailers, grocery stores and discount chains. For more information on discontinued operations, see Note B on page 77 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
