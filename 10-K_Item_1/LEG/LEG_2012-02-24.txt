Item 1. Business.



Summary



Leggett & Platt, Incorporated was founded as a
partnership in Carthage, Missouri in 1883 and was incorporated in 1901. The Company, a pioneer of the steel coil bedspring, has become an international diversified manufacturer that conceives, designs and produces a wide range of engineered
components and products found in many homes, offices, retail stores and automobiles. As discussed below, our operations are organized into 20 business units, which are divided into 10 groups under our four segments: Residential Furnishings;
Commercial Fixturing & Components; Industrial Materials; and Specialized Products.



Overview of Our Segments



Residential Furnishings Segment







Our Residential
Furnishings segment began with an 1885 patent of the steel coil bedspring. Today, we supply a variety of components used by bedding and upholstered furniture manufacturers in the assembly of their finished products. Our range of products offers our
customers a single source for many of their component needs.



Efficient manufacturing methods, internal production of key raw materials, and numerous manufacturing and assembly locations allow us to supply many customers with components at a lower cost than they can
produce themselves. In addition to cost savings, sourcing components from us allows our customers to focus on designing, merchandising and marketing their products.







PART I



Products



Products manufactured or distributed by our Residential Furnishings groups include:



Bedding Group

•Innersprings (sets of steel coils, bound together, that form the core of a mattress)

•Wire forms for mattress foundations



Furniture Group

•Steel mechanisms and hardware (enabling furniture to recline, tilt, swivel, rock and elevate) for reclining chairs and sleeper sofas

•Springs and seat suspensions for chairs, sofas and loveseats

•Steel tubular seat frames

•Bed frames, ornamental beds, and “top-of-bed” accessories

•Adjustable beds



Fabric & Carpet Underlay Group

•Structural fabrics for mattresses, residential furniture and industrial uses

•Carpet underlay materials (bonded scrap foam, felt, rubber and prime foam)

•Geo components (synthetic fabrics and various other products used in ground stabilization, drainage protection, erosion and weed control, as well as
silt fencing)



Customers



Most of our Residential Furnishings customers are
manufacturers of finished bedding products (mattresses and foundations) or upholstered furniture for residential use. We also sell many products, including ornamental beds, bed frames, adjustable beds, carpet underlay, and top-of-bed accessories,
directly to retailers and distributors. We sell Geo Components products primarily to dealers, contractors, landscapers, road construction companies and government agencies.



Commercial Fixturing & Components Segment

Industrial Materials Segment







We believe that the
quality of our products and services, together with low cost, have made us the leading U.S. supplier of drawn steel wire and a major producer of welded steel tubing. Our Wire group operates a steel rod mill with an annual output of approximately
500,000 tons, of which a substantial majority is used by our own wire mills. We have five wire mills that supply virtually all the wire consumed by our other domestic businesses. Our Steel Tubing business unit operates two major plants that also
supply nearly all of our internal needs for welded steel tubing. In addition to supporting our internal requirements, we also supply many external customers with wire and steel tubing products.



On January 12, 2012, we completed the acquisition of
Western Pneumatic Tube Holding, LLC (Western). Western is a leading provider of integral components for critical aircraft systems, and forms the new Aerospace Products business unit within the Tubing Group. Western specializes in fabricating
thin-walled, large diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed products from titanium, nickel and other specialty materials for leading aerospace suppliers and OEMs.

Strategic Direction



Key Financial Metric



Total Shareholder Return (TSR), relative to peer companies, is the key financial measure that we use to assess long-term performance. TSR
= (Change in Stock Price + Dividends Received)/Beginning Stock Price. Our goal is to achieve TSR in the top 1/3 of the S&P 500 over the long term through a balanced approach that employs all four TSR sources: revenue growth, margin expansion,
dividends, and share repurchases.



We monitor our
TSR performance (relative to the S&P 500) on a rolling three-year basis. For the three-year measurement period that ended December 31, 2011 we generated TSR of 21% per year, on average, which places us in the top 38% of the S&P
500. In addition, our TSR has exceeded that of the S&P 500 index for four consecutive years.







PART I



Our incentive programs reward return generation. Senior executives participate in a
TSR-based incentive program (based on our performance compared to the performance of a group of approximately 320 peers). Business unit bonuses emphasize the achievement of higher returns on the assets under the unit’s direct control.



More Cash to Shareholders



During the past three years, we generated approximately $1.26
billion of cash flow from operations. Capital expenditures were $75 million in 2011, compared to $68 million in 2010, and $83 million in 2009.



Since late 2007, we have raised quarterly dividends by 56%, from $.18 per share to $.28 per share currently. During the past three years,
we have also repurchased roughly 27 million shares of our stock (and issued approximately 11 million shares through employee benefit plans), which reduced the net outstanding shares by approximately 11%. In 2011, we repurchased
approximately 10 million shares at an average per share price of $22.86 (and issued approximately 3 million shares through employee benefit plans). As discussed in more detail below under “Acquisitions,” we completed the
acquisition of Western Pneumatic Tube for a cash purchase price of $188 million in January 2012. As such, we do not anticipate repurchasing a significant number of shares in 2012.



Portfolio Management



We utilize a rigorous strategic planning process to help
guide future decisions regarding business unit roles, capital allocation priorities, and new areas in which to grow. We review the portfolio classification of each unit on an annual basis to determine its appropriate role (Grow, Core, Fix, or
Divest). This review includes criteria such as competitive position, market attractiveness, business unit size, and fit within our overall objectives, as well as financial indicators such as EBIT and EBITDA growth, operating cash flows, and return
on assets. Business units in the Grow category should provide avenues for profitable growth from competitively advantaged positions in attractive markets. Core business units are expected to enhance productivity, maintain market share, and generate
cash flow from operations while using minimal capital. To remain in the portfolio, business units are expected to consistently generate after-tax returns in excess of our cost of capital. Business units that fail to consistently attain minimum
return goals will be moved to the Fix or Divest categories.



Disciplined Growth



Long-term, we aim to eventually achieve consistent, profitable growth of 4-5% annually. To attain this goal, we will need to supplement
the approximate 2-3% growth that our markets typically produce (in normal economic times) with two additional areas of opportunity. First, we must enhance our success rate at developing and commercializing innovative new products within markets in
which we already enjoy strong competitive positions. Second, we need to uncover new growth platforms; opportunities in markets new to us, and in which we would possess a competitive advantage.







PART I



Our long-term, 4-5% annual growth objective envisions periodic acquisitions. We seek
acquisitions within our growth businesses, and look for opportunities to enter new, higher growth markets (carefully screened for sustainable competitive advantage). We expect all acquisitions to (a) have a clear strategic rationale, a
sustainable competitive advantage, and a strong fit with the Company; (b) create value by enhancing Total Shareholder Return, have an internal rate of return in excess of 10% and have positive discounted cash flow; (c) for stand-alone
companies: generally, revenue in excess of $50 million, strong management and future growth opportunity with a strong market position in a market growing faster than GDP; and (d) for add-on companies: generally, revenue in excess of $15
million, significant synergies, and a strategic fit with an existing business unit.



Acquisitions



We had no significant acquisitions in 2009, 2010 or 2011.



In January 2012, we acquired Western Pneumatic Tube, which produces thin-walled, larger diameter, welded tubing and specialty formed
products for aerospace applications. Western specializes in fabricating products from specialty materials, such as titanium and other refractory alloys, nickel-based alloys, stainless steel and other high strength metals. Western supplies its
products primarily to the commercial aerospace market, but also to the defense and industrial markets. Western’s products are utilized in aircraft systems and aircraft engine systems, including fuel, hydraulic, pneumatic, environmental, life
support, stability and cooling systems. Western operates two facilities: one in Kirkland, Washington, and another near San Diego, California. Western had 2011 sales of $57 million and is part of our Industrial Materials segment. The cash purchase
price of $188 million was financed with proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes under our existing commercial paper program, as discussed in Note U on page 122 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. For further information about
acquisitions, see Note R on page 115 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Divestitures



2011 Divestiture



There were no significant divestitures in 2011.



2010 Divestiture



We divested the Storage Products business unit (previously in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment) in the third quarter
of 2010. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this business unit. Storage Products is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2010 revenue of approximately $37 million.



2009 Divestiture



We divested the Coated Fabrics business unit (previously in
the Residential Furnishings segment) in the third quarter of 2009. No significant gains or losses were realized on the sale of this unit. Coated Fabrics is reflected as a discontinued operation with 2009 revenue of approximately $12 million.







PART I



We also divested five other businesses in 2008 as part of our 2007 strategic alignment,
including our former Aluminum Products segment. For further information about divestitures and discontinued operations, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Segment Financial Information



For information about sales to external customers, sales by product line, earnings before interest and taxes, and total assets of each of
our segments, refer to Note F on page 91 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Foreign Operations



The percentages of our external sales related to products manufactured outside the United States for the previous three years are shown below.







Our international
operations are principally located in Europe, China, Canada and Mexico. The products we make in these countries primarily consist of:



Europe

•Innersprings for mattresses

•Wire and wire products

•Lumbar and seat suspension systems for automotive seating

•Machinery and equipment designed to manufacture innersprings for mattresses and other bedding-related components



China

•Innersprings for mattresses

•Recliner mechanisms and bases for upholstered furniture

•Formed wire for upholstered furniture







PART I



•Retail store fixtures and gondola shelving

Mexico

•Innersprings and fabricated wire for the bedding industry

•Retail point-of-purchase displays

•Automotive control cable systems and seating components

•Shafts for the appliance industry



Our international expansion strategy is to locate our operations where we believe we would possess a competitive advantage and where
demand for components is growing. Also, in instances where our customers move the production of their finished products overseas, we have located facilities nearby to supply them more efficiently.



Our international operations face the risks associated with
any operation in a foreign country. These risks include:

•Foreign currency fluctuation

•Foreign legal systems that make it difficult to protect intellectual property and enforce contract rights

•Credit risks

•Increased costs due to tariffs, customs and shipping rates

•Potential problems obtaining raw materials, and disruptions related to the availability of electricity and transportation during times of crisis or war

•Nationalization of private enterprises

•Political instability in certain countries



Our Specialized Products segment, which derives 75% of its trade sales from foreign operations, is particularly subject to the above
risks. These and other foreign-related risks could result in cost increases, reduced profits, the inability to carry on our foreign operations and other adverse effects on our business.

Distribution of Products



In each of our segments, we sell and distribute our products
primarily through our own personnel. However, many of our businesses have relationships and agreements with outside sales representatives and distributors. We do not believe any of these agreements or relationships would, if terminated, have a
material adverse effect on the consolidated financial condition or results of operations of the Company.



Raw Materials



The products we manufacture require a variety of raw materials. We believe that worldwide supply sources are readily available for all the raw materials we use. Among the most important are:

•Various types of steel, including scrap, rod, wire, coil, sheet, stainless and angle iron

•Foam scrap

•Woven and non-woven fabrics

•Titanium and nickel-based alloys and other high strength metals



We supply our own raw materials for many of the products we
make. For example, we produce steel rod that we make into steel wire, which we then use to manufacture:

•Innersprings and foundations for mattresses

•Springs and seat suspensions for chairs and sofas

•Automotive seating components



We supply the majority of our domestic steel rod requirements through our own rod mill. Our wire drawing mills supply nearly all of our
U.S. requirements for steel wire. We also produce welded steel tubing, both for our own consumption and for sale to external customers.







PART I



Customer Concentration



We serve thousands of customers worldwide, sustaining many
long-term business relationships. In 2011, our largest customer accounted for less than 6% of our consolidated revenues. Our top 10 customers accounted for approximately 22% of these consolidated revenues. The loss of one or more of these customers
could have a material adverse effect on the Company, as a whole, or on the respective segment in which the customer’s sales are reported, including our Residential Furnishings, Commercial Fixturing & Components and Specialized Products
segments.



Patents and Trademarks



The chart below shows the approximate number of patents
issued, patents in process, trademarks registered and trademarks in process held by our operations as of December 31, 2011. No single patent or group of patents, or trademark or group of trademarks, is material to our operations, as a whole.
Most of our patents relate to products sold in the Specialized Products segment, while a substantial majority of our trademarks relate to products sold in the Residential Furnishings and Specialized Products segments.







Some of our most
significant trademarks include:

•Semi-Flex®(box spring components and foundations)

•Mira-Coil®, VertiCoil®, Lura-Flex®,
Superlastic®andComfortCore®(mattress
innersprings)

•S-cape®andActive Support Technology®(power foundations)

PART I



•Spuhl®(mattress innerspring manufacturing machines)

•Gribetz®andPorter®(quilting and sewing machines)

•Quietflex®andMasterack®(equipment and accessories for vans and trucks)



Research and Development



We maintain research, engineering and testing centers in Carthage, Missouri and do additional research and development work at many of our
other facilities. We are unable to calculate precisely the cost of research and development because the personnel involved in product and machinery development also spend portions of their time in other areas. However, we estimate the cost of
research and development to be approximately $20 million per year in each of the last three years.



Employees



As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately 18,300 employees, of which roughly 12,900 were engaged in production. Of the 18,300,
approximately 8,600 were international employees (4,900 in China). Labor unions represented roughly 15% of our employees. We did not experience any material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2011. Management is
not aware of any circumstances likely to result in a material work stoppage related to contract negotiations with labor unions during 2012. The chart below shows the approximate number of employees by segment.







As of December 31,
2010, we had approximately 19,000 employees.







PART I



Competition



Many companies offer products that compete with those we manufacture and sell. The number of competing companies varies by product line,
but many of the markets for our products are highly competitive. We tend to attract and retain customers through product quality, innovation, competitive pricing and customer service. Many of our competitors try to win business primarily on price
but, depending upon the particular product, we experience competition based on quality, performance and availability as well.



We believe we are the largest U.S. manufacturer, in terms of revenue, of the following:

•Components for residential furniture and bedding

•Carpet underlay

•Adjustable bed bases

•Components for office furniture

•Drawn steel wire

•Automotive seat support and lumbar systems

•Bedding industry machinery for wire forming, sewing and quilting

•Thin-walled, titanium, nickel and other specialty tubing for the aerospace industry



We continue to face pressure from foreign competitors as some
of our customers source a portion of their components and finished products offshore. In addition to lower labor rates, foreign competitors benefit (at times) from lower raw material costs. They may also benefit from currency factors and more
lenient regulatory climates. We typically remain price competitive, even versus many foreign manufacturers, as a result of our highly efficient operations, low labor content, vertical integration in steel and wire, and large scale purchasing of raw
materials and commodities. However, we have also reacted to foreign competition in certain cases, by selectively adjusting prices, and by developing new proprietary products that help our customers reduce total costs.



Premium non-innerspring mattresses (those that have either a
foam or air core) have experienced rapid growth in the U.S. bedding market in recent years. While still a relatively small portion of the total market in units (approximately 10%), these products represent a much larger portion of the total market
in dollars (approximately 25%-30%) due to their higher average selling prices. We expect these products to continue to grow. Some of our traditional bedding customers are beginning to offer mattresses that combine an innerspring core with top layers
comprised of specialty foam and gel. These hybrid products allow our bedding customers to address a consumer preference for the feel of a specialty mattress and the characteristics of an innerspring.



In late 2007, we filed an antidumping suit related to
innerspring imports from China, South Africa and Vietnam. We saw a distinct decline in unfair imports during 2008 after the antidumping investigations began. As a result, we regained market share and performance in our Bedding Group improved. The
investigations were brought to a favorable conclusion in early 2009. The current antidumping duty rates on innersprings from these countries are significant, ranging from 116% to 234%, and should remain in effect at least until early 2014. Imported
innersprings from these countries are now supposed to be sold at fair prices, however the duties on certain innersprings are being evaded by various means including shipping the goods through a third country and falsely identifying the country of
origin. Leggett, along with several U.S. manufacturers of products with active antidumping or antidumping/countervailing duty orders, formed a







PART I



coalition and are working with Members of Congress, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection to seek stronger enforcement of existing antidumping and/or
countervailing duty orders.



Seasonality



As a diversified manufacturer, we generally have not
experienced significant seasonality. The timing of acquisitions, dispositions, and economic factors in any year can distort the underlying seasonality in certain of our businesses. Historically, for the Company as a whole, the second and third
quarters typically have proportionately greater sales, while the first and fourth quarters are generally lower.



•Residential Furnishings:typically does not exhibit any significant seasonality, except for a reduction in fourth quarter sales.

•Commercial Fixturing & Components:generally has modestly stronger third quarter sales of its store fixture products, with the fourth
quarter significantly lower. This aligns with the retail industry’s normal construction cycle—the opening of new stores and completion of remodeling projects in advance of the holiday season.

•Industrial Materials:minimal variation in sales throughout the year.

•Specialized Products:relatively little quarter-to-quarter variation in sales, although the automotive business is typically somewhat heavier in
the second and fourth quarters of the year and lower in the third quarter due to model changeovers and plant shutdowns in the automobile industry during the summer.



Backlog



Our customer relationships and our manufacturing and inventory practices do not create a material amount of backlog orders for any of our
segments. Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to the level of incoming orders and projected demand based on customer relationships.



Working Capital Items



For information regarding working capital items, see the discussion of “Cash from Operations” in Item 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations on page 46.



Government Contracts



The Company does not have a significant amount of sales derived from Government contracts subject to renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of any Government.



Environmental Regulation



Our operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws
and regulations related to the protection of the environment. We have policies intended to ensure that our operations are conducted in compliance with applicable laws. While we cannot predict policy changes







PART I



by various regulatory agencies, management expects that compliance with these laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, capital expenditures,
financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.



Internet Access
to Information



We routinely post information
for investors to our website (www.leggett.com) under the Investor Relations section. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to those reports are made available, free of
charge, on our website as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. In addition to these reports, the Company’s Financial Code of Ethics, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and Corporate
Governance Guidelines, as well as charters for the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees of our Board of Directors, can be found on our website under the Corporate Governance section. Information contained on our
website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



Discontinued Operations



Some of our prior businesses are disclosed in our annual financial statements as discontinued operations since (i) the operations and
cash flows of the businesses were clearly distinguished and have been eliminated from our ongoing operations; (ii) the businesses have been disposed of; and (iii) we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of
the businesses. The discontinued operations include:



•Coated Fabrics unit (previously reported in the Residential Furnishings segment).We divested the Coated Fabrics unit in the third quarter of
2009. It sold non-slip rug underlay and shelf liners primarily to retailers and distributors.



•Storage Products unit (previously reported in the Commercial Fixturing & Components segment).The Storage Products unit was divested in
the third quarter of 2010. It sold storage racks and carts used in the food service and healthcare industries.



For further information on these discontinued operations and 2009 activity primarily related to the Aluminum Products Segment that was
divested in 2008, see Note B on page 84 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
