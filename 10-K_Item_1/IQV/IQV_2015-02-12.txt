Item 1. Business

Overview

We are the world’s largest
provider of biopharmaceutical development services and commercial outsourcing services. We are positioned at the intersection of business services and healthcare and generated $4.2 billion of service revenues in 2014, conduct business in
approximately 100 countries and have approximately 32,600 employees. We use the breadth and depth of our service offerings, our global footprint and our therapeutic, scientific and analytics expertise to help our biopharmaceutical customers, as well
as other healthcare customers, to be more successful in an increasingly complex healthcare environment.

Since our founding in 1982, we
have grown to become a leader in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical therapies. Our Product Development segment is the world’s largest contract research organization, or CRO, based upon the most recently available public
information of reported service revenues, and is focused primarily on Phase II-IV clinical trials and associated laboratory and analytical activities. Our Integrated Healthcare Services segment includes one of the leading global commercial
pharmaceutical sales and service organizations. Integrated Healthcare Services provides a broad array of services, including commercial services, such as contract pharmaceutical sales forces, and healthcare business services for the broader
healthcare sector, such as real-world and late phase research, market access and consulting, health information analytics and technology consulting, and other healthcare solutions. Product Development contributed approximately 74% and Integrated
Healthcare Services contributed approximately 26% to our 2014 service revenues. Additional information regarding our segments is presented in Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form
10-K.

Our global scale and capabilities enable us to work with the leading companies in the biopharmaceutical sector. During each of the
last 12 years, we have worked with the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies ranked by 2013 reported revenues. We have provided services in connection with the development or commercialization of the top 100 best-selling biopharmaceutical products
and the top 50 best-selling biologic products, from 2013 as measured by reported sales. Of the new molecular entities, or NMEs, and new biological license applications, or BLAs, approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA,
from 2004 through 2013, we helped develop or commercialize 100% of the central nervous system drugs, 92% of the oncology drugs and 87% of the cardiovascular drugs.

In 2014, our service revenues were $4.2 billion and our net income attributable to our shareholders was $356.4 million. In addition, our 2014
net new business was $5.6 billion, and we ended the year with $11.2 billion in backlog. Our backlog is diversified with 37% from top 10 biopharmaceutical companies, 22% representing contracts with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 11-20, 19%
representing contracts with biopharmaceutical companies ranked as 21-50, and 22% representing contracts with biopharmaceutical companies outside the top 50, in each case, as ranked by 2013 sales. See Part I, Item 1, “Business—Net New
Business Reporting and Backlog” for more detail. During each of the last seven years, we have had at least eight customers from whom we earned more than $100 million in service revenues. No single customer represented more than 10% of our 2014
revenues.

Our Markets

The market
served by Product Development consists primarily of biopharmaceutical companies, including medical device and diagnostics companies, that outsource services associated with the development of pharmaceutical products, such as clinical trials. We
estimate that total research and development, or R&D, spending was approximately $140 billion in 2014 of which biopharmaceutical spending on drug development was approximately $95 billion, and we estimate that our addressable market (clinical
development spending excluding preclinical spending) was approximately $52 billion. The portion of this $52 billion that was outsourced in 2014, based on our estimates, was approximately $21 billion. We estimate that the potential market for Product
Development’s services will experience a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 6%-8% from 2014 through 2017 as a result of increased R&D spending by biopharmaceutical companies and the increased outsourcing of this spending as compared
to 2013.






Integrated Healthcare Services primarily addresses markets related to the use of approved
biopharmaceutical products. We estimate that total spending related to approved drugs, including biopharmaceutical spending on commercialization of these drugs and expenditures by participants in the broader healthcare market on real-world research,
healthcare technology implementation analytics, and evidence-based medicine, exceeded $98 billion in 2014. Integrated Healthcare Services links product development to healthcare delivery. This segment’s services include commercial services such
as recruiting, training, deploying and managing a global sales force, channel management, patient engagement services, market access consulting, brand communication, consulting, and health information analytics and technology consulting. In
addition, Integrated Healthcare Services offers real-world late phase services such as observational studies, comparative effectiveness studies and product and disease registry services, which are intended to help increase the quality and
cost-effectiveness of healthcare and payer provider solutions. We believe that a combination of cost pressure in healthcare systems around the world and the increasing focus on the value and efficacy of pharmaceutical therapy provide us many
opportunities to grow our revenues and expand our service offerings by improving the cost-effectiveness of drug therapies.

We believe
that we are well-positioned to benefit from current trends in the biopharmaceutical and healthcare industries that affect our markets, including:

Trends in R&D Spending.We estimate that R&D spending was approximately $140 billion in 2014 and will grow to approximately $150
billion in 2017, with drug development accounting for approximately 68% of total expenditures. R&D spending trends are impacted as a result of several factors, including major biopharmaceutical companies’ efforts to replenish revenues lost
from the so-called “patent cliff” of recent years, increased access to capital by the small and midcap biotechnology industry, and recent increases in pharmaceutical approvals by regulatory authorities. In 2014, there were approximately
4,620 drugs in the Phase I-III development pipeline, an increase of 35% since 2008, and there were 41 NME approvals by the FDA in 2014 which was the highest number of approvals in any of the past 18 years. We believe that further R&D spending,
combined with the continued need for cost efficiency across the healthcare landscape, will continue to create opportunities for biopharmaceutical services companies, particularly those with a global reach and broad service offerings, to help
biopharmaceutical companies with their pre- and post-launch product development and commercialization needs.

Growth in
Outsourcing.We estimate that clinical development spending outsourced to CROs in Phases I-IV in 2014 was approximately $21 billion and will grow to approximately $26 billion by 2017. We expect outsourced clinical development to CROs to grow
6%-8% annually during this period. Of this annual growth, we believe that up to 2% will be derived from increased R&D expenditures, with the remainder coming from increased outsourcing penetration. We estimate that overall outsourcing
penetration in 2014 was 39%. The market served by Integrated Healthcare Services is diverse, which makes it difficult to estimate the current amount of outsourced integrated healthcare services and the expected growth in such services. However,
based on our knowledge of these markets we believe that, while the rate of outsourcing penetration varies by market within Integrated Healthcare Services, the current outsourcing penetration of the estimated $98 billion addressable market is
approximately 23%. As business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector, we believe that the growth rate for outsourcing across the Integrated Healthcare Services markets will be similar to the growth in clinical development.

We believe that we are well positioned for the future evolution of the healthcare sector as increasing demand from governments and other
payers around the world for quality, accountability and value for money drive biopharmaceutical companies, providers and other healthcare organizations to transform their value chain away from a vertically integrated model to one that is more
focused on their core competencies. In particular, we believe that the following trends will result in increased outsourcing to global biopharmaceutical services companies:



•Maximizing Productivity and Lowering Costs.Declining R&D productivity, increased development costs and diminished returns on marketing and
sales have negatively impacted biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that the need for biopharmaceutical companies to maximize productivity and






lower costs in their product development and commercial operations will cause them to look to partners as they enter into outsourcing arrangements to improve efficiency, increase sales force
utilization and effectiveness, improve clinical success rates and turn fixed costs into variable costs across their R&D and commercial operations.



•Managing Complexity.Biopharmaceutical companies face environments in which it has become increasingly difficult to operate. Improved standards of care in many therapeutic areas and the emergence of new types of
therapies, such as biologics, genetically targeted therapies, gene and stem cell therapies, and other treatment modalities have led to more complex development and regulatory pathways, such as recently released guidelines in the United States and
Europe for the development of “biosimilar” products. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities, including our expertise in biomarkers and genomics and our global laboratory network, position us well to help
biopharmaceutical companies manage the complexities inherent in an environment where this type of expertise is important.



•Providing Enhanced Value for Patients.As healthcare costs rise globally, governments and third-party payers have looked for ways both to control healthcare expenditures and increase the quality, safety and
effectiveness of drug therapies. Governments and regulatory bodies have adopted, and may continue to adopt, healthcare legislation and regulations that may significantly impact the healthcare industry by demanding more value for money spent and
financial accountability for patient outcomes. Such legislation and regulations may tie reimbursement to the demonstrated clinical efficacy of a therapy, require payers and providers to demonstrate efficacy in the delivery of healthcare services and
require more evidence-based decisions, all of which we believe will increase the demand for innovative and cost-effective commercialization strategies and outcome research and data analytics services.



•Increased Importance of Product Development in Local Markets.Increasingly, regulators require trials involving local populations as part of the process for approving new pharmaceutical products, especially in
certain Asian and emerging markets. Understanding the epidemiological and physiological differences in different ethnic populations and being able to conduct trials locally in certain geographies will be important to pharmaceutical product growth
strategies, both for multinational and local/regional biopharmaceutical companies. We believe that our global clinical development capabilities and unmatched presence in Asia and other emerging markets make us a strong partner for biopharmaceutical
companies managing the complexities of international drug development.



•Increasing Number of Phase II-IV Clinical Trials.Based on the current and expected composition of the global drug development pipeline, we believe that spending on Phase II-IV clinical trials will continue to
increase. As the complexity and cost of Phase II-IV trials grow, trial sponsors will continue to seek to recruit patients on a global basis. We believe that this increased spending and the demand for global patient recruitment will favor the limited
number of biopharmaceutical services companies that have both the capabilities to administer large, complex global clinical trials and relationships with thought-leading investigators and trial sites. In addition, as these drugs come to market, we
believe that biopharmaceutical companies will also seek to outsource an increasing amount of the commercial and other integrated healthcare services necessary to effectively launch and market these drugs.



•Increase in Strategic Collaborations.Larger CROs are able to provide a greater variety of services and therapeutic expertise to the biopharmaceutical community. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to enter into
long-term strategic collaborations with global service providers. We believe that biopharmaceutical companies have historically preferred, and will continue to prefer, financially sound, global service providers with broad therapeutic and functional
expertise such as our company when selecting strategic providers.






Our Strategy

We believe that we are positioned to be the partner of choice to biopharmaceutical companies worldwide and a key resource to other healthcare
industry participants who are looking to improve operational, therapeutic and patient outcomes. We differentiate ourselves from others in our industry through our competitive strengths and strategies, which include:

Technology Solutions and Process/Data Capabilities.For over 32 years, we have been devoted to advancing
state of the art technology, processes and analytics to optimize our service offerings and provide our customers with the information they need to quickly make critical decisions regarding the development and commercialization of their products. We
have focused on investment in quality data, including de-identified electronic health records, or EHR. Because data are only as good as the analytics used to analyze them, we have also invested heavily in data analytics products, services and
professionals. As part of this investment, we created our proprietary data integration tool, the Quintiles Infosario®platform, which is a suite of modules that integrates data from across
multiple source systems to provide us and our customers with current, quality and comprehensive information regarding clinical trials, allowing decisions to be made quickly and efficiently. In addition, we have developed a planning and design
platform and other software solutions to enable improvements to the drug development process and to demonstrate the value of biopharmaceutical products in the real world.

Our History

We were founded in 1982 by
Dennis B. Gillings, CBE, Ph.D., who was a biostatistics professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Gillings and his cofounder pioneered the use of sophisticated statistical algorithms to improve the quality of data used
to determine the efficacy of various drug therapies. We expanded internationally into Europe in 1987 and into Asia in 1993. In 1994, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, and in 2003 we exited the public markets through a going private
transaction. In May 2013, we returned to the public markets by completing an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE.

Services

We address the needs of the healthcare industry by providing product development and integrated healthcare services to help our customers
navigate the complex healthcare environment and improve outcomes. The broad scope of our services allows us to help our customers rapidly assess the viability of a growing number of potential new therapies, cost-effectively accelerate development of
the most promising ones, launch new products to the market quickly, and evaluate their impact and appropriate use on patients.






We offer our services through two reportable segments: Product Development and Integrated
Healthcare Services. The figure below displays the range of our services across both of our segments.





Product Development

Product Development provides services and expertise that enable biopharmaceutical companies to outsource the clinical development process from
first-in-man trials to post-launch monitoring. Product Development is comprised of Clinical Solutions & Services and Consulting. Clinical Solutions & Services provides services necessary to develop biopharmaceutical products,
including project management and clinical monitoring functions for conducting multi-site trials (generally Phase II-IV) and clinical trial support services that improve clinical trial decision making and data management and strategic planning and
design services that improve decisions and performance. Consulting provides strategy and management consulting services based on deep life science expertise and advanced analytics as well as regulatory and compliance consulting services.

Clinical Solutions & Services

Project Management and Clinical Monitoring

Drawing upon our years of experience, our site databases, our site relationships and our highly trained staff, Clinical Solutions &
Services enables the efficient conduct and coordination of multi-site trials (generally Phase II-IV). Clinical Solutions & Services’ service offerings include protocol design, feasibility and operational planning, site start up,
patient recruitment, project management and monitoring of the investigator sites and data from patient visits.

Study Design and
Operational Planning.We assist our customers in preparing the study protocol, designing clinical report forms and identifying appropriate patients, sites and the optimal country mix to meet their objectives, among other key upfront decisions.
The study protocol defines the medical hypotheses to be examined, the number of patients required to produce statistically valid results, the period of time over which they must be tracked, the frequency and dosage of drug administration and the
study procedures.

Investigator/Site Recruitment.During clinical trials, the drug is administered to patients by physicians,
referred to as investigators, at hospitals, clinics or other sites. The quality of a clinical trial is dependent on the






quality of the investigators who perform the trials. Through our global prime site and partner programs, we have established relationships with thousands of investigators who conduct our clinical
trials worldwide. We provide our investigators the resources and tools they need to effectively conduct the trials.

Site and
Regulatory Start Up.The process of identifying, training and contracting with sites while also securing regulatory and ethics approval is a complex and time-consuming aspect of clinical trials. We have a dedicated unit that draws upon our
experience from participating in trials globally across multiple therapeutic areas for over 30 years. We utilize technology and analytics to simplify and streamline this process, reducing time to first patient in and laying the groundwork for
successful trial execution.

Patient Recruitment.We assist our customers in recruiting patients for clinical trials through
investigator relationships, media advertising, use of web-based techniques and other methods. We also help to ensure patients are retained for the duration of the trials. We use informatics tools and media-based recruitment methods to identify,
reach and recruit the appropriate patients. Our patient recruitment system includes informatics tools and media-based recruitment methods to provide broad pools of prescreened patients as well as an efficient enrollment process and a call center.
Through our global patient recruitment programs, we have enrolled on average over 100,000 patients in Phase I-III trials annually during the last six years.

Clinical Monitoring.We deploy and manage clinical research associates, or CRAs, to work with and monitor sites to assure the quality
of the data, which we gather according to Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, and International Conference on Harmonisation, or ICH, regulations and guidelines, and to meet the customers’ and regulatory authorities’ requirements according to
the study protocol. CRAs also assist with site initiation, training, patient enrollment and retention. Regulatory authorities are encouraging the use of innovative approaches in trial monitoring, and we have deployed targeted, data-driven,
risk-based, monitoring techniques to improve monitoring efficiency and effectiveness, focusing on the areas most likely to impact the quality of the data and safety of the patients in their particular trial.

Project Management.Our project managers help customers navigate the complexity of the clinical trial process and coordinate all of the
various activities, data streams and timelines associated therewith. Aligned by therapeutic experience, our project managers highlight risks before they become issues, while managing budgets and timelines. As trials become more complex, project
managers are becoming increasingly important in ensuring trials are completed successfully.

Clinical Trial Support Services

Each clinical trial requires a number of concurrent services and data streams. We offer a broad range of functional services and consultation
to support clinical trials through specialized expertise that help customers efficiently collect, analyze and report the quality data and evidence they need to gain regulatory approval. Our clinical trial support services include:

Clinical Data Management.Our data management services provide support for the collection, organization, validation and analysis of
clinical data. Data used can be captured via electronic data capture, or EDC, or from paper. These databases include customized databases to meet customer-specific formats, integrated databases to support regulatory submissions to numerous
regulatory authorities around the world, including, for example, to the FDA to support new drug applications, or NDAs, BLAs, and premarket approval applications, or PMAs, for medical devices.

Biostatistical Services.We provide statistical analyses of scientific databases for all phases of the drug development process.
Biostatistics is at the core of every clinical trial, and we have been pioneering the use of biostatistics since our founding in 1982. We have nearly 800 biostatisticians and statistical programmers around the world, of whom more than 60% have
advanced degrees. We use biostatistics to assist our customers in speeding drug development, staying current with evolving best practices, navigating regulatory requirements and developing and qualifying biomarkers.






Central Laboratories.We support the laboratory testing and reporting needs inherent in
all phases of clinical trials, offering globally harmonized safety and efficacy biomarker testing through the world’s largest, wholly owned network of central laboratories with individual College of American Pathologists accreditations.
Services include assay development and validation, the provision of protocol-specific trial materials, customized lab report design, and specimen management and archival. We support trials anywhere in the world through wholly owned facilities in the
United States, the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, China, Singapore and Japan, and a tightly coordinated network of affiliated laboratories in Argentina and Brazil. Our global processes and harmonization scheme are designed to help ensure the
standardization of laboratory test results and integrated, comparable data collection, management and transfer, including providing direct electronic integration of laboratory data into safety and efficacy reports for NDA submissions.

Genomic Laboratory.We provide a broad range of solutions in support of our customers’ clinical trial and research efforts,
including experiment design, sample analysis, nucleic acid isolation, gene expression profiling, genotyping, next generation sequencing and advanced bioinformatics. Our services include whole genome to focused set gene expression profiling and

begin to develop and disseminate scientific information, and develop and present educational forums to help gain opinion leader support for a new drug.

Other Healthcare Solutions

We utilize our global integrated health service platform, together with our scientific and clinical expertise, to offer a range of specialized
services to organizations and users across the care continuum, including governments, hospitals, physician offices and pharmacies. These services include comparative and cost-effectiveness research capabilities, clinical management analytics,
decision support services, medication adherence and health outcome optimization services, and web-based systems for measuring quality improvement. Our July 2014 acquisition of Encore Health Resources, or Encore, enhanced our EHR expertise, which is
becoming increasingly important as biopharmaceutical customers, payers, and providers focus on measuring outcomes based on real-world performance in terms of clinical effectiveness and value.

Customers and Marketing

To provide and
coordinate service offerings to our customers, we have business development efforts across our service offerings and within many individual service offerings, and we also maintain an integrated business development group. To foster accountability in
key service offering areas, each offering area has a designated leader who drives the financial contribution of that offering area. These two axes of business development direct the selling and business development personnel in each of our major
locations in the United States and throughout Europe, Asia, Japan, Canada and Latin America, providing coverage of both multi-national and regional/domestic biopharmaceutical companies.

We take a holistic customer-oriented view toward business development. Our integrated business development group is responsible for assessing
our customers’ current and future needs and helping to define the right service offerings to be delivered at the right time. This group includes dedicated customer teams that deliver customized solutions from the full breadth and depth of our
service offerings for the world’s leading biopharmaceutical companies. In addition, we continue to evolve our relationships with our small, mid-size and other biopharmaceutical customers outside the 20 largest biopharmaceutical companies based
on 2013 reported revenues.

In 2014, we earned service revenues of over $100 million each in seven countries in North America, Europe and
Asia. Please refer to Note 19 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details regarding our foreign and domestic operations in 2014, 2013 and






2012. For a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations, see “Risk Factors—Our business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively
affect our results of operations and financial condition.”

Our service revenues were attributed to our segments as follows:

Additional information regarding our segments is presented in Note 20 to our audited consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated
service revenues in 2014, 2013 or 2012. In the past, we have derived, and may in the future derive, a significant portion of our service revenues from a relatively limited number of major projects or customers. As biopharmaceutical companies
continue to outsource large projects and/or functions to fewer providers, this concentration of business could increase.

Competition

The market for our product development services is highly competitive, and we compete against traditional CROs, the in-house R&D
departments of biopharmaceutical companies, universities and teaching hospitals. Among the traditional CROs, there are several-hundred small, limited-service providers, several medium-sized firms and only a few full-service companies with global
capabilities. Consolidation among CROs likely will result in greater competition among the larger CROs for customers, clinical personnel and acquisition candidates. Product Development’s primary competitors include Pharmaceutical Product
Development, Inc., PAREXEL International Corporation, ICON plc, inVentiv Health, Inc., or inVentiv, INC Research, PRA International, and Covance, Inc., which has entered into a merger agreement with Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, or
LabCorp, that is expected to close in February 2015, among others. Competitive factors for product development services include:



•previous experience and relationships;



•medical and scientific experience in specific therapeutic areas;



•the quality of contract research;



•speed to completion;



•the ability to organize and manage large scale trials on a global basis;



•the ability to manage large and complex medical databases;



•the ability to provide statistical, regulatory and consulting services;



•the ability to recruit investigators and patients expeditiously;



•the ability to deploy and integrate IT systems to improve the efficiency of contract research;



•risk and reward sharing;



•the ability to form strategic alliances;



•a global presence with strategically located facilities and breadth of service offerings;



•financial strength and stability; and



•price.






Integrated Healthcare Services competes in the post-approval and commercialization arenas.
In the post-approval arena our solutions compete against real-world and late phase research providers including boutique firms, divisions of biopharmaceutical companies and divisions of traditional CRO’s (noted above). Our commercial solutions
compete against the in-house sales and marketing departments of biopharmaceutical companies, other contract pharmaceutical sales and service organizations and consulting firms. Integrated Healthcare Services’ primary commercial competitors in
the United States include inVentiv, PDI, Inc. and Publicis Selling Solutions. Outside of the United States, Integrated Healthcare Services commercial teams typically compete against single country or more regionally focused commercial service
providers, such as United Drug plc, inVentiv, EPS Corporation and CMIC HOLDINGS Co., Ltd in Japan. The primary competitive factors affecting Integrated Healthcare Services are breadth of service offering and ability to deploy in an integrated
manner, quality and track record, i.e. the proven ability to quickly assemble, train and manage large qualified commercial teams on a global footprint and price.

Notwithstanding these competitive factors, we believe that the synergies arising from integrating product development services with commercial
services, supported by global operations, data analysis and the ability to form long term strategic alliances with biopharmaceutical companies, differentiate us from our competitors.

Government Regulation

Good
Clinical Practice

GCP regulations and guidelines contain the industry standards for the conduct of clinical trials with respect to
the integrity of the data and safety of the research subjects. The FDA, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, Japan’s Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare and many other regulatory authorities require that study results and data submitted to
such authorities be based on trials conducted in accordance with GCP provisions. Records for clinical trials must be maintained for specified periods for inspection by the FDA and other regulators. Significant non-compliance with GCP requirements
can result in the disqualification by regulators of data collected during the clinical trial.

Our standard operating procedures related
to clinical trials are written in accordance with regulations and guidelines appropriate to the region where they are used, thus helping to ensure compliance with GCP. FDA regulations and guidelines serve as a basis for our North American standard
operating procedures. Within Europe, we perform our work subject to the EMA’s Note for Guidance “Good Clinical Practice for Trials on Medicinal Products in the European Community.” All clinical trials (other than those defined as
non-interventional) to be submitted to the EMA must meet the requirements of the ICH’s GCP standards. Our offices in Asia and in Latin America have developed standard operating procedures in accordance with their local requirements and in
harmony with our North American and European operations.

Regulation of Drugs, Biologics and Medical Devices

In the United States, pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, the Public Health Service Act, or the PHS Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping,
approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical, biological and medical device products. Failure to comply with applicable United States
requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve a pending NDA for a new drug, a BLA for a new biological product, or PMA or clearance for a new medical device, warning or
untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, and criminal prosecution.






Before a new drug or biologic may be marketed, it must undergo extensive testing and regulatory
review to determine that it is safe and effective and be approved by the FDA or other regulatory authority. Even after approval, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required in the event of a modification to the device, its labeling or its
manufacturing process.

Regulation of Patient Information

Our information management services relate to the diagnosis and treatment of disease and are, therefore, subject to substantial governmental
regulation. In addition, the confidentiality of patient-specific information and the circumstances under which such patient-specific records may be released for inclusion in our databases or used in other aspects of our business is heavily
regulated. Federal, state and foreign governments are contemplating or have proposed or adopted additional legislation governing the possession, use and dissemination of personal data, such as personal health information and personal financial data,
as well as security breach notification rules for loss or theft of such data. Additional legislation or regulation of this type might, among other things, require us to implement new security measures and processes or bring within the legislation or
regulation de-identified health or other personal data, each of which may require substantial expenditures or limit our ability to offer some of our services.

In particular, personal health-related information is recognized in many countries such as the United States, the European Union, and several
countries in Asia, as a special, sensitive category of personal information, subject to additional mandatory protections. Violations of data protection regulations are subject to administrative penalties, civil money penalties and criminal
prosecution, including corporate fines and personal liability.

In order to comply with these evolving laws and regulations, we may need
to implement new data protection, privacy and data security measures, which may require us to make substantial expenditures or cause us to discontinue or limit the products and services we offer. In addition, if we violate applicable laws,
regulations, contractual commitments or other duties relating to the use, privacy or security of health information, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions, civil liability or criminal prosecution or suffer reputational harm, and it may be
necessary to modify our business practices.

Regulation of Promotion, Marketing and Distribution of Pharmaceutical Products and Medical Devices

Our integrated healthcare services are subject to detailed and comprehensive regulation in each geographic market in which we operate.
Such regulation relates, among other things, to the distribution of drug samples, the marketing and promotion of approved products, the qualifications of sales representatives and the use of healthcare professionals in sales functions.

In the United States, our integrated healthcare services are subject to numerous federal and state laws pertaining to promotional activities
involving pharmaceutical products and medical devices, such as the FDA’s regulations against “off-label promotion,” which require sales representatives to restrict promotion of the approved product they are detailing to the approved
labeling for the product, and the Prescription Drug Marketing Act which imposes licensing, personnel record keeping, packaging, labeling, product handling and facility storage and security requirements. Other federal and state laws prohibit
manufacturers, suppliers and providers from offering, giving or receiving kickbacks or other remuneration in connection with ordering or recommending the purchase or rental of healthcare items and services. The sale or distribution of pharmaceutical
products and devices is also governed by the United States Federal Trade Commission Act and state consumer protection laws. We are subject to similar regulations currently in effect in the other countries where we offer integrated healthcare
services.

We are also subject to various laws and regulations that may apply to certain drug and device promotional practices, including,
among others, various aspects of the Medicare program. Violations of these laws and regulations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties, including possibly as an “aider and abettor.”






Regulation of Laboratories

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration has
established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all
material respects with such federal, state and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions.

Further, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must
comply with CLIA, as well as requirements established by various states. The failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of the CLIA certification.

Intellectual Property

We develop and use
a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, invention assignments and other
contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have also registered or applied for trademarks and service marks in the United States and a number of
foreign countries, and our trademark “Quintiles®” is of material importance to us. Although the duration of trademark and service mark registrations varies from country to country,
trademarks and service marks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe the ownership of
our patents, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our
employees. Other than our Quintiles®trademark, we do not have any material patents, trademarks, service marks, licenses, franchises or concessions.

Net New Business Reporting and Backlog

Net new business is the expected service revenues awarded during the period from projects under signed contracts, letters of intent and, in
some cases, written pre-contract commitments, and adjustments on contracts modified or canceled during the period. Net new business under sole provider arrangements is recorded over the life of the arrangement as projects are awarded.






Consistent with our methodology for calculating net new business during a particular period,
backlog represents, at a particular point in time, future service revenues from work not yet completed or performed under signed contracts, letters of intent and, in some cases, pre-contract commitments that are supported by written communications.
Once work begins on a project, service revenues are recognized over the duration of the project. Included within backlog at December 31, 2014 is approximately $7,593 million of backlog that we do not expect to generate revenue in the next 12
months.

Backlog was as follows:



December 31,20142013(in millions)Backlog$11,244$9,855

Net new business was as follows:



Year Ended December 31,201420132012(in millions)Product Development$4,374$3,772$3,474Integrated Healthcare Services1,2281,1271,027Total$5,602$4,899$4,501

We believe that backlog and net new business may not be consistent indicators of future revenues because they
have been and likely will be affected by a number of factors, including the variable size and duration of projects, many of which are performed over several years, cancellations, and changes to the scope of work during the course of projects.
Projects that have been delayed remain in backlog, but the timing of the revenue generated may differ from the timing originally expected. Additionally, projects may be terminated or delayed by the customer or delayed by regulatory authorities. If a
customer cancels an order, we may be reimbursed for the costs we have incurred. However, we typically do not have a contractual right to the full amount of the revenue reflected in our backlog or net new business contracts in the event of
cancellation. For more details regarding risks related to our backlog, see “Risk Factors—The relationship of backlog to revenues varies over time.”

Employees

As of December 31, 2014,
we had approximately 32,600 full-time equivalent employees in approximately 60 countries, comprised approximately of 12,300 in the Americas region, 10,100 in the Europe and Africa region and 10,200 in the Asia-Pacific region, with at least 500
employees in 10 countries around the world. As of December 31, 2014, Product Development and Integrated Healthcare Services had approximately 21,400 and 9,500 full-time equivalent employees, respectively. In addition, our centralized
operations/corporate office had approximately 1,700 full-time equivalent employees.

The success of our business depends upon our ability
to attract and retain qualified professional, scientific and technical staff. The level of competition among employers in the United States and overseas for skilled personnel, particularly those with Ph.D., M.D. or equivalent degrees or training, is
high. We believe that our brand recognition and our multinational presence, are an advantage in attracting qualified candidates. In addition, we believe that the wide range of clinical trials in which we participate allows us to offer broad
experience to clinical researchers. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. Employees in some of our non-United States locations are represented by works councils as required by
local laws. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
