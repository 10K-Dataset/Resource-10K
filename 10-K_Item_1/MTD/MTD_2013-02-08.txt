We manufacture a wide variety of precision instruments and provide value-added services to our customers. Our principal products and principal services are set forth below. We have followed this description of our products and services with descriptions of our customers and distribution, sales and service, research and development, manufacturing and certain other matters. These descriptions apply to substantially all of our products and related segments.

Laboratory Instruments

We make a wide variety of precision laboratory instruments, including laboratory balances, pipettes, titrators, thermal analysis systems and other analytical instruments. The laboratory instruments business accounted for approximately46%of our net sales in2012,45%in2011and46%in2010.

Laboratory Balances

Our laboratory balances have weighing ranges from one ten-millionth of a gram up to 64 kilograms. To cover a wide range of customer needs and price points, we market our balances in a range of product tiers offering different levels of functionality. Based on the same technology platform, we also manufacture mass comparators, which are used by weights and measures regulators as well as laboratories to ensure the accuracy of reference weights. Laboratory balances are primarily used in the pharmaceutical, food, chemical, cosmetics and other industries.

Pipettes

Pipettes are used in laboratories for dispensing small volumes of liquids. We operate our pipette business with the Rainin brand name. Rainin develops, manufactures and distributes advanced pipettes, tips and accessories, including single- and multi-channel manual and electronic pipettes. Rainin maintains service centers in the key markets where customers periodically send their pipettes for certified recalibrations. Rainin’s principal end markets are pharmaceutical, biotech and academia.









Analytical Instruments

Titrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are used in environmental and research laboratories as well as in quality control labs in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage and other industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking models, which can perform two determinations simultaneously on multiple vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate routine work in quality control applications.

Thermal analysis systems measure material properties as a function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and polymer industries and increasingly in the pharmaceutical industry.

pH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also sell density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture content of a sample by utilizing an infrared dryer to evaporate moisture.

Laboratory Software

LabX, our PC-based laboratory software platform, manages and analyzes data generated by our balances, titrators, pH meters, moisture analyzers and other analytical instruments. LabX provides full network capability; has efficient, intuitive protocols; and enables customers to collect and archive data in compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s traceability requirements for electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR Part 11).

Automated Chemistry Solutions

Our current automated chemistry solutions focus on selected applications in the chemical and drug discovery process. Our automated lab reactors and in situ analysis systems are considered integral to the process development and scale-up activities of our customers. Our on-line measurement technologies based on infrared and laser light scattering enables customers to monitor chemical reactions and crystallization processes in real time in the lab and plant. We believe that our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring significant efficiencies to the development process, enabling our customers to bring new chemicals and drugs to market faster.

Process Analytics

Our process analytics business provides instruments for the in-line measurement of liquid parameters used primarily in the production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage, microelectronics, chemical and refining companies. Approximately half of our process analytics sales are to the pharmaceutical and biotech markets, where our customers need fast and secure scale-up and production that meets the validation processes required for GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards. We are a leading solution provider for liquid analytical measurement to control and optimize production processes. Our solutions include sensor technology for measuring pH, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, conductivity, turbidity, ozone and total organic carbons and automated systems for calibration and cleaning of measurement points. Intelligent sensor diagnostics capabilities enable improved asset management solutions for our customers to reduce process downtime and maintenance costs. Our instruments offer leading multi-parameter capabilities and plant-wide control system integration, which are key for integrated measurement of multiple parameters to secure production quality and efficiency. With a worldwide network of specialists, we support customers in critical process applications, compliance and systems integration questions.











Industrial Instruments

We manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and offer dedicated software solutions for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food and other industries. In addition, we manufacture metal detection and other end-of-line product inspection systems used in production and packaging. We supply automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification technologies for transport, shipping and logistics customers. We also offer heavy industrial scales and related software. The industrial instruments business accounted for approximately45%of our net sales in both2012and2011, and43%in2010.



Industrial Weighing Instruments

We offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and balances, such as bench scales and floor scales, for weighing loads from a few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging from measuring materials in chemical production to weighing packages. Our products are used in a wide range of applications, such as counting applications and in formulating and mixing ingredients.

Industrial Terminals

Our industrial scale terminals collect data and integrate it into manufacturing processes, helping to automate them. Our terminals allow users to remotely download programs or access setup data and can minimize downtime through predictive rather than reactive maintenance.

Transportation and Logistics

We are a leading global supplier of automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning and identification technologies. With these solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of packages for appropriate billing, logistics and quality control. Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information systems.

Vehicle Scale Systems

Our primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle transaction processing.

Industrial Software

We offer software that can be used with our industrial instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.Net, statistical quality control software, Formweigh.Net, our formulation/batching software and OverDrive, which supports the operation of vehicle scales. FreeWeigh.Net and Formweigh.Net provide full network capability and enable customers to collect and archive data in compliance with 21 CFR Part 11.

Product Inspection

Increasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more sophisticated end-of-line product inspection systems (e.g., for use in food processing and packaging, pharmaceutical and other industries). We are a leading global provider of metal detectors, x-ray and camera-based visioning equipment and checkweighers that are used in these industries. Metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself. X-ray-based vision inspection helps detect non-metallic contamination, such as glass, stones and pits, which enter the manufacturing process for similar reasons.  Our x-ray systems can also detect metal in metallized containers and can be used for mass control. We









also provide camera-based vision inspection solutions that provide in-line inspection of package quality and content and enable our customers to implement traceability and serialization tracking, which are needs for food and beverage, consumer goods and pharmaceutical companies. Checkweighers are used to control the filling content of packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. Both x-ray and metal detection systems may be used together with checkweighers as components of integrated packaging lines. FreeWeigh.Net is our statistical and quality control software that optimizes package filling, monitors weight-related data and integrates it in real time into customers’ enterprise resource planning and/or process control systems.

Retail Weighing Solutions

Supermarkets, hypermarkets and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits and cheeses). We offer stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing, price finding and printing. In addition, we offer networked scales and software, which can integrate backroom, counter, self-service and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management system. Customer benefits are in the areas of pricing, merchandising, inventory management and regulatory compliance. Our instruments have been expanded to allow in-store marketing which permits customers to make more decisions at the point of sale. The retail business accounted for approximately9%of our net sales in2012,10%in2011and11%in2010.

Customers and Distribution

Our principal customers include companies in the following key end markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and biotech companies, as well as independent research organizations); food and beverage producers; food retailers; chemical, specialty chemicals and cosmetics companies; the transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; the electronics industry; and the academic community.

Our products are sold through a variety of distribution channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated through indirect channels, including sales of our “Ohaus” branded products. Ohaus branded products target markets, such as the educational market, in which customers are interested in lower cost, a more limited set of features and less comprehensive support and service.

We have a diversified customer base, with no single customer accounting for more than1%of2012net sales.

Sales and Service

Market Organizations

We maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service. The market organizations are customer-focused, with an emphasis on building and maintaining value-added relationships with customers in our target market segments. Each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations (described below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives, new product and application ideas and information about key market segments.









We have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers. AtDecember 31, 2012, our sales and service group consisted of approximately6,220employees in sales, marketing and customer service (including related administration) and post-sales technical service, located in36countries. This field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach.

Service

Our service business remains successful with a focus on repair and preventative maintenance services as well as further expansion of our offerings to include value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration and certification. We have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting use of our instruments in compliance with FDA regulations, and we can provide these services regardless of the customer’s location around the world. This global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world. Service (representing service contracts, repairs and replacement parts) accounted for approximately21%of our net sales in2012and2011, and23%in2010. A significant portion of this amount is derived from the sale of replacement parts.

Beyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base provide us with sales opportunities and innovative product and application ideas.



Research and Development and Manufacturing

Producing Organizations

Our research, product development and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs, improve customer focus and maintain technological leadership. The producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations.

Research and Development

We continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications. Over the last three years, we have invested$325.6 millionin research and development ($112.5 millionin2012,$116.1 millionin2011and$97.0 millionin2010). In2012, we spent approximately4.8%of net sales on research and development. Our research and development efforts fall into two categories:

•technology advancements, which generate new products and increase the value of our products. These advancements may be in the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for our technologies, more accurate or reliable measurement, additional software capability or automation through robotics or other means, which allow us to design products more specific to the needs of the industries we serve, and

•cost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design.

We devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development. This includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments, application-specific software and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems. We closely









integrate research and development with marketing, manufacturing and product engineering. We have approximately1,180employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe.

Manufacturing

We are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally located in China, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Laboratory instruments are produced mainly in Switzerland and to a lesser extent in the United States and China, while our remaining products are manufactured worldwide. We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations, and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process. All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001 certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand.

We generally manufacture only critical components, which are components that contain proprietary technology. When outside manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components. We use a wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials. From time to time we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally.

Backlog; Seasonality

Our manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically no longer than one to two months.

Our business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than, sales in the second and third quarters. Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately26%to30%of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater effect on income from operations than on net sales because fixed costs are spread evenly across all quarters.



Employees

Our total workforce including employees and temporary personnel as ofDecember 31, 2012was approximately12,400throughout the world, including approximately4,600in Europe,3,400in North and South America and4,300in Asia and other countries.

We believe our employee relations are good, and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years. Labor unions do not represent a meaningful number of our employees.

Sustainability

We believe a sustainable business is one positioned for long-term growth and for us it defines our approach to decision making, from how we manage our impact on the environment to our relationships with employees, customers and shareholders.  We produced our first sustainability report in 2011 which outlined our GreenMT program which was launched in 2010 to improve our understanding of how our business affects the environment. We have gathered data to understand the magnitude of the global greenhouse gas or CO2 footprint generated not only by our fuel and electricity use, but also the products we sell and our use of supply chains.  We are now working to establish goals and will start to make reductions in these emissions.  This includes new ways of managing our vehicle fleets, incorporating new









design features into our products, improving the energy efficiency of our buildings and processes and looking at how we source the electricity we use in our facilities. We think these efforts will produce a favorable impact on the environment as well as potential savings in future periods.

Blue Ocean Program

“Blue Ocean” refers to our program to establish a new global operating model with standardized, automated and integrated processes, and high levels of global data transparency. It will encompass a new enterprise architecture, with a global, single instance ERP system. Within our IT systems we are moving toward integrated, homogeneous applications and common data structures. We will also largely standardize our key business processes. The implementation of the systems and processes have been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi-year period with the initial go-live rollout having occurred in 2010. We have implemented the Blue Ocean program in our Swiss and Chinese operations and now have approximately one-third of the program completed as measured in users. We expect to implement the program in the United States and Germany over the next two years and will then have more than half of the Company's users on the system. Incremental capital expenditures for the Blue Ocean program are more than$20 millionannually. This amount may change based upon fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We expect the return on this investment when complete to include improved realized pricing, reduced operating costs and working capital requirements.

Intellectual Property

We hold over4,650patents and trademarks (including pending applications), primarily in the United States, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, China, South Korea, Brazil and India. Our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are protected by patents of various durations. Products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our business. We regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property.

Regulation

Our products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations.

Approvals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the European Union.

Our products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our









competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.

We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities. A former subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo, LLC (“MT”) known as Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc. (“Hi-Speed”) was one of two private parties ordered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (“NJDEP”), in an administrative consent order (“ACO”) signed on June 13, 1988, to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a certain property in Landing, New Jersey. After the other party ordered under this ACO failed to fulfill its obligations, Hi-Speed became solely responsible for compliance with the ACO. Residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a Classification Exception Area (“CEA”) which NJDEP has approved and within which MT oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern. A concurrent Well Restriction Area also exists for the site. The NJDEP does not view these vehicles as remedial measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. In 2010, testing of indoor air at certain buildings within the site led to the installation of a vapor intrusion mitigation system at one building. We estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate$0.5 million.

In addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets who, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets.

We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track record of technological innovation; our comprehensive, high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service offering; our large installed base of weighing instruments; and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region, product range and customer. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing and customer service and support. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these









investments or that we will be successful in identifying, developing and maintaining any competitive advantages.

We believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself, application support, service support and price. In emerging markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products, price is a more important factor than in developed markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well.
