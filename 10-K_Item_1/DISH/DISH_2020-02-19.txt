​

Pay-TV

​

We offer pay-TV services under the DISH®brand and the Sling®brand (collectively “Pay-TV” services).  The DISH branded pay-TV service consists of, among other things, FCC licenses authorizing us to use direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) and Fixed Satellite Service (“FSS”) spectrum, our owned and leased satellites, receiver systems, broadcast operations, customer service facilities, a leased fiber optic network, in-home service and call center operations, and certain other assets utilized in our operations (“DISH TV”).

As of December 31, 2019, we had 11.986 million Pay-TV subscribers in the United States, including 9.394 million DISH TV subscribers and 2.592 million Sling TV subscribers.

​

Master Transaction Agreement.On May 19, 2019, we and our wholly-owned subsidiary BSS Merger Sub Inc., (“Merger Sub”), entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the “Master Transaction Agreement”) with EchoStar and EchoStar BSS Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EchoStar (“Newco”).

​

Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, among other things: (i) EchoStar carried out an internal reorganization in which certain assets and liabilities of the EchoStar Satellite Services segment, the business segment of EchoStar that provides broadcast satellite operations and satellite services, as well as certain related licenses, real estate properties and employees (together, the “BSS Business”) were transferred to Newco (the “Pre-Closing Restructuring”); (ii) EchoStar distributed all outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Newco (such stock, “Newco Common Stock”) on a pro rata basis (the “Distribution”), to the holders of record of Class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of EchoStar and Class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of EchoStar; and (iii) upon the consummation of the Pre-Closing Restructuring and the Distribution, Merger Sub merged with and into Newco (the “Merger”) such that, upon consummation of the Merger, Merger Sub ceased to exist and Newco continued as our wholly-owned subsidiary.

​

Effective September 10, 2019, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement, in consideration for the Merger, we issued 22,937,188 shares of our Class A common stock to the holders of Newco Common Stock at a ratio of 0.23523769 of our Class A common stock for each outstanding share of Newco Common Stock.  The transaction was structured as a tax-free spin-off and merger.

Sprint Asset Acquisition

​

Asset Purchase Agreement

​

On July 26, 2019, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “APA”) with T-Mobile US, Inc. (“TMUS”) and Sprint Corporation (“Sprint” and together with TMUS, the “Sellers” and after the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger, sometimes referred to as “NTM”).

​

Pursuant to the APA, after the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger and at the closing of the transaction, NTM will sell to us and we will acquire from NTM certain assets and liabilities associated with Sprint’s Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Sprint-branded prepaid mobile services businesses (the “Prepaid Business”) for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion as adjusted for specific categories of net working capital on the Closing Date (the “Prepaid Business Sale”).  Under the Proposed Final Judgment (as defined below), TMUS is required to divest the Prepaid Business to us no later than the latest of (i) 15 days after TMUS has enabled us to provision any new or existing customers of the Prepaid Business holding a compatible handset device onto the NTM network, (ii) the first business day of the month following the later of the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger or the receipt of approvals for the Prepaid Business Sale, and (iii) five days after the entry of the Final Judgment (as defined below) by the District Court (as defined below).  We expect to fund the purchase price with cash on hand or other available sources of liquidity.

​

At the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, we and NTM will enter into a transition services agreement under which we will receive certain transitional services (the “TSA”), a master network services agreement for the provision of network services by NTM to us (the “MNSA”), an option agreement entitling us to acquire certain decommissioned cell sites and retail stores of NTM (the “Option Agreement”) and an agreement under which we would purchase all of Sprint’s 800 MHz spectrum licenses, totaling approximately 13.5 MHz of nationwide wireless spectrum for an additional approximately $3.59 billion (the “Spectrum Purchase Agreement” and together with the APA, the TSA, the MNSA and the Option Agreement, the “Transaction Agreements”).  See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Sprint Asset Acquisition” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Transaction Agreements.

​

Wireless

​

Beginning on November 5, 2019, and while the approval of the Sprint-TMUS merger is pending, the March 7, 2020 build-out deadline for both the AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block spectrum bands is tolled; however, if the Sprint-TMUS merger is not consummated, the original deadlines (as discussed in Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless – DISH Network Spectrum” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) would be reinstated with extensions equal to thelength of time the deadline was tolled.  During October 2019, we paused work on our narrowband Internet of Things (“IoT”) deployment due to our March 2020 build-out deadlines being tolled.  We have issued requests for information and proposals (“RFI/Ps”) to various vendors in the wireless industry as we move forward with our5G broadband network deployment (“5G Network Deployment”).

​

Since 2008, we have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets and made over $10 billion in non-controlling investments in certain entities, for a total of over $21 billion, as described further below.  The $21 billion of investments related to wireless spectrum licenses described below does not include $5 billion ofcapitalized interestrelated to the carrying value of such licenses.  See Note 2 “Capitalized Interest” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on capitalized interest.

DISH Network Spectrum

​

We have directly invested over $11 billion to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses and related assets.  These wireless spectrum licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements,

as well as certain renewal requirements

.  In March 2017, we notified the FCC that we planned to deploy a narrowband IoT network on certain of these wireless licenses, which was to be the first phase of our network deployment (“First Phase”).

We expected to complete the First Phase by March 2020, with subsequent phases to be completed

thereafter.  We have entered into vendor contracts with multiple parties for, among other things, base stations, chipsets, modules, tower leases, the core network, RF design, and deployment services for the First Phase.  Among other things, initial RF design in connection with the First Phase was complete, we had secured certain tower sites, and we were in the process of identifying and securing additional tower sites.  The core network had been installed and commissioned.  We installed the first base stations on sites in 2018 and were in the process of deploying the remaining base stations.  During October 2019, we paused work on our narrowband IoT deployment due to our March 2020 build-out deadlines being tolled as discussed above.  In addition, we have issued RFI/Ps to various vendors in the wireless industry as we move forward with our

5G Network Deployment

5G Network Deployment

We will need to make significant additional investments or partner with others to, among other things, commercialize, build-out, and integrate these licenses and related assets, and any additional acquired licenses and related assets; and comply with regulations applicable to such licenses.  Depending on the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, and regulatory compliance, any such investments or partnerships could vary significantly.  In addition, as we consider our options for the commercialization of our wireless spectrum, we will incur significant additional expenses and will have to make significant investments related to, among other things, research and development, wireless testing and wireless network infrastructure.  We may also determine that additional wireless spectrum licenses may be required to commercialize our wireless business and to compete with other wireless service providers.  See Note 2 “

Business Strategy – Pay-TV

​

Our Pay-TV business strategy is to be the best provider of video services in the United States by providing products with the best technology, outstanding customer service, and great value.  We promote our Pay-TV services as providing our subscribers with a better “price-to-value” relationship than those available from other subscription television service providers.

​

●Products with the Best Technology.We offer a wide selection of local and national HD programming and are a technology leader in our industry, offering award-winning DVRs (including our Hopper®whole-home HD DVR), multiple tuner receivers, 1080p and 4K video on demand and external hard drives.  We offer several Sling TV services, including Sling Orange (our single-stream Sling domestic service), Sling Blue (our multi-stream Sling domestic service), Sling International, Sling Latino, among others, as well as add-on extras, pay-per-view events and a cloud based DVR service.

​

●Outstanding Customer Service.We strive to provide outstanding customer service by improving the quality of the initial installation of subscriber equipment, improving the reliability of our equipment, better educating our customers about our products and services, and resolving customer problems promptly and effectively when they arise.

​

​



●Great Value.We have historically been viewed as the low-cost provider in the pay-TV industry in the United States. However, today with Dish TV, we are focused on our brand promise “Tuned into You” and a message of Service, Value and Technology. For example, for certain new and qualifying customers we guarantee our pricing for certain programming packages and equipment for a two-year commitment period.  We also offer a differentiated customer experience with our award winning Hopper Platform that integrates voice control powered by Google Assistant, access to apps including Netflix, Prime Video and You Tube, and the ability to watch live, recorded and On Demand content anywhere with the Dish Anywhere mobile application.  As another example, our Sling Orange service and our Sling Blue service are two of the lowest priced live-linear online streaming services in the industry.

​

Products and Services

​

DISH TV services.We offer a wide selection of video services under the DISH TV brand, with access to hundreds of channels depending on the level of subscription.  Our standard programming packages generally include programming provided by national broadcast networks, local broadcast networks and national and regional cable networks.  We also offer programming packages that include regional and specialty sports channels, premium movie channels and Latino and international programming.  Our Latino and international programming packages allow subscribers to choose from over 270 channels in 28 languages.

​

In addition, we offer our DISH TV subscribers streaming access through DISH On Demand®to thousands of movies and TV shows via their TV or Internet-connected tablets, smartphones and computers.

​

Our DISH TV subscribers also have the ability to use dishanywhere.com and ourDISH Anywheremobile applications for smartphones, streaming media devices and tablets to view authorized content, search program listings and remotely control certain features of their DVRs.  Dishanywhere.com and ourDISH Anywheremobile applications provide access to thousands of movies and television shows.

​

Sling TV services.We market our Sling TV services primarily to consumers who do not subscribe to traditional satellite and cable pay-TV services.  Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available on multiple streaming-capable devices including streaming media devices, TVs, tablets, computers, game consoles and smart phones.  We offerSling domestic,Sling International, and Sling Latinovideo programming services.Our domestic Sling TV services have a single-stream service branded Sling Orange and a multi-stream service branded Sling Blue, which includes, among other things, the ability to stream on up to three devices simultaneously.  We also offer add-on extras, pay-per-view events and a cloud based DVR service.  During the second quarter 2018, we introduced a free tier of service as well as multiple a la carte channel options.

​



OnTech Smart Services and DISH Smart Home Services.We have expanded the capabilities of our in-home services and provide these services to non-DISH TV subscribers under the “OnTech Smart Services” brand and to DISH TV subscribers under the “DISH Smart Home Services” brand.  These capabilities include, among other things, appliance repair, installation and set-up of Smart Home Devices, security systems, wireless networks, TVs and home theaters, and over-the-air antennas.  We intend to grow this business in the future.  Installation and support services include performing these services for other companies’ products, with a focus on installation and set-up of connected home devices. Our partners include brands like Google Nest, Ring, and Polk, among others, that offer connected home devices and leverage OnTech Smart Services to provide installation and support to their customers.

Technology.

Our DISH TV subscribers receive programming via equipment that includes a small satellite dish, digital set-top receivers, and remote controls.  Our Hopper and Joey

®

whole-home DVR promotes a suite of integrated features and functionality designed to maximize the convenience and ease of watching TV anytime and anywhere.  It also has several innovative features that a consumer can use, at his or her option, to watch and record television programming, through their televisions, tablets, phones and computers.  The Hopper 3, among other things, features 16 tuners, delivers an enhanced 4K Ultra HD experience, and supports up to seven TVs simultaneously.  In 2017, we launched the AirTV Player that allows customer to combine free channels from over-the-air (“OTA”) antennas with their streaming content and Amazon Alexa was integrated into the Hopper platform.  In 2018, we launched AirTV, which allows customers the ability to bring local OTA channels into their home, DVR them and watch them on multiple devices, including Roku, Fire-TV, iOS and Android.

In 2019, we launched the “Snap” device, bringing the performance of older generation Hoppers and Joeys inline with the current products.  Google Assistant was integrated into the Hopper platform to improve and expand the DISH voice experience and allow customers more smart-home control options.  As part of this integration, an updated DISH voice remote with Google branding also launched.  We also support the Nest Hello video doorbell which allows customers to see who is at their door from their television.

​



Broadband.In addition to our wide selection of pay-TV programming and award-winning technology,we historically offered broadband services under the dishNET™ brand, which includes satellite broadband services that utilize advanced technology and high-powered satellites launched by Hughes and ViaSat and wireline broadband services.  However, as of the first quarter 2018, we have transitioned our broadband business focus from wholesale to authorized representative arrangements, and we are no longer marketing dishNET broadband services.  Our existing broadband subscribers will decline through customer attrition.  Generally, under these authorized representative arrangements, we will receive certain payments for each broadband service activation generated and installation performed, and we will not incur subscriber acquisition costs for these activations.

Agreement with the DOJ:  The Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment

​

In connection with the Prepaid Business Sale and the consummation of the Sprint-TMUS merger, we, TMUS, Sprint, Deutsche Telekom AG and SoftBank Group Corporation agreed with the United States Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) on certain key terms relating to the Transaction Agreements and our wireless service business and spectrum.  On July26, 2019, we, TMUS, Sprint, Deutsche Telekom AG (“DT”) and SoftBank Group Corp. (“SoftBank” and collectively with us, TMUS, Sprint and DT, the “Defendants”) entered into a Stipulation and Order (the “Stipulation and Order”) with the DOJ binding the Defendants to a Proposed Final Judgment (the “Proposed Final Judgment”) which memorialized the agreement between the DOJ and the Defendants.  The Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment were filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (the “District Court”) on July26, 2019.  Certain of the provisions of the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment are also reflected in the terms of the Transaction Agreements.  In addition to the terms reflected in the Transaction Agreements, the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment provide for other rights and obligations of the Sellers and us, including the following:



●For a period of one year after the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, if we determine that certain assets not included in the divestiture were previously used by the Prepaid Business and are reasonably necessary for the continued competitiveness of the Prepaid Business, subject to certain carve-outs, we may request that such assets be transferred to us, which the DOJ can approve or deny in its sole discretion.

●Within one year of the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale, we will be required to offer nationwide postpaid retail mobile wireless service.

●NTM must take all actions required to enable us to provision any new or existing customer with a compatible handset onto the NTM network within 90 days of the entry of the Final Judgment.

●If we elect not to purchase the 800 MHz licenses pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement, we must pay $360 million (equal to 10% of the Spectrum Purchase Agreement purchase price) to the United States.  However, we will not be required to make such payment if we have deployed a core network and offered 5G service to at least 20% of the U.S. population within three years of the closing of the Prepaid Business Sale.

●If we buy the 800 MHz spectrum pursuant to the Spectrum Purchase Agreement but fail to deploy all of the 800 MHz spectrum licenses for use in the provision of retail mobile wireless services by the expiration of the Final Judgment (as described below), the DOJ may require us to forfeit to the FCC any of the 800 MHz licenses for spectrum that are not being used to provide retail mobile wireless services, unless we are already providing nationwide retail wireless service.

●We and NTM must negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement for NTM to lease some or all of our 600 MHz spectrum licenses for deployment to retail consumers by NTM.  We and NTM must report on the status of the negotiations within 90 days after the filing of the Final Judgment.  If no agreement has been reached by 180 days following the filing of the Final Judgement, the DOJ may resolve any dispute in its sole discretion, provided that such resolution must be on commercially reasonable terms to both parties.

●We and NTM must agree to support eSIM technology on smartphones.

●The Sellers must introduce the suppliers and distributors of the Prepaid Business to us and the Sellers may not interfere in our negotiations with such suppliers and distributors.

●On the first day of the fiscal quarter following the entry of the Final Judgment and of each 180-day period thereafter, we will be obligated to provide the DOJ with a description of our deployment efforts over the prior quarter including: (i) the number of towers and small cells deployed, (ii) the spectrum bands on which we have deployed equipment, (iii) progress in obtaining devices that operate on our spectrum frequencies, (iv) POPs coverage of our network, (v) the number of our mobile wireless subscriptions, (vi) the amount of traffic transmitted to our subscribers using our network and using NTM’s network, and (vii) whether there are or have been any efforts by NTM to interfere with our efforts to deploy and operate our network.

6​​




●We cannot sell, lease or otherwise provide the right to use any of the divested assets to any national facilities-based mobile wireless provider and may not sell any of the divested assets or similar assets back to TMUS during the term of the Final Judgment (as described below), except that we may lease back to NTM up to 4 MHz of the 800 MHz spectrum we will acquire (as discussed above).

●We must comply with the 2023 AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, AWS H Block, and nationwide 5G broadband network build-out commitments made to the FCC, subject to verification by the FCC (as described below).  If we fail to comply with such build-out commitments, we could face civil contempt in addition to the substantial voluntary contributions and license forfeitures described below if we fail to meet the June 14, 2023 commitments (as described below).

​

Upon the signing of the Stipulation and Order and the Proposed Final Judgment by the District Court, the Sellers will be permitted by the DOJ to consummate the Sprint-TMUS merger (subject to any additional closing conditions related thereto).  The Proposed Final Judgment is subject to the procedures of the Antitrust Procedures and Penalties Act, pursuant to which, following a 60-day public comment period and other related procedures, the Proposed Final Judgment will be entered with the District Court (the Proposed Final Judgment as so entered with the District Court, the “Final Judgment”).  The term of the Final Judgment will be seven years from the date of its entry with the District Court or five years if the DOJ gives notice that the divestitures, build-outs and other requirements have been completed to its satisfaction.  A monitoring trustee has been appointed by the District Court that has the power and authority to monitor the Defendants’ compliance with the Final Judgment and settle disputes among the Defendants regarding compliance with the provisions of the Final Judgment and may recommend action to the DOJ in the event a party fails to comply with the Final Judgment.

​

FCC Build-Out Commitments

​

















In a letter filed with the FCC on July 26, 2019, we voluntarily committed to deploy a nationwide 5G broadband network and meet revised timelines relating to the build-out of our AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, AWS H Block and 600 MHz spectrum assets, subject to certain penalties.Pursuant to these commitments, we requested multi-year extensions to deploy our AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, and AWS H Block spectrum, and we have committed to build out our 600 MHz licenses on an accelerated schedule to better align with our 5G deployment.We have also committed to offer 5G broadband service to certain population coverage targets, along with minimum core network, tower and spectrum use targets, and have waived our right to deploy any technology of our choice under the FCC’s “flexible use” rules with respect to these spectrum bands.Failure to meet the various commitments would require us to pay voluntary contributions totaling up to $2.2 billion to the FCC and would subject certain licenses in the AWS-4, Lower 700 MHz E Block, and AWS H Block spectrum to forfeiture.We have also agreed not to sell our AWS-4 and 600 MHz spectrum for six years without prior DOJ and FCC approval (unless such sale is part of a change of control of DISH Network).Additionally, we have agreed not to lease a certain percentage of network capacity on our AWS-4 and 600 MHz spectrum for six years to the three largest U.S. wireless carriers (i.e., AT&T, Verizon and NTM), without prior FCC approval.

​

On November 5, 2019, the FCC released an Order that, among other things, approved the Sprint-TMUS merger, tolled our existing March 7, 2020 build-out deadline for our AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block Licenses, and directed the FCC’s Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to adopt our commitments after a 30 day review period (the “FCC Merger Order”).

​











Beginning on November 5, 2019, and while the approval of the Sprint-TMUS merger is pending, the March 7, 2020 build-out deadlinefor both the AWS-4 and Lower 700 MHz E Block spectrum bands istolled; however, if the Sprint-TMUS merger is not consummated, the original deadline will be reinstated with extensions equal to the length of time the deadline was tolled.  Except for the tolling of the March 2020 deadline, we may not receive the requested buildout extensions unless and until the Prepaid Business Sale closes.

​

Our 5G deployment commitments for each of the four spectrum bands are generally as follows:



●With respect to the 600 MHz licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2023, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 75% of the population in each Partial Economic Area (which are service areas established by the FCC) no later than June 14, 2025.  Note that these commitments are earlier than the current 600 MHz Final Build-Out Requirement date of June 2029.  See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Sprint Asset Acquisition” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form10-K for further information.

●With respect to the AWS-4 licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population no later than June 14, 2023.

●With respect to the Lower 700 MHz E Block licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population who are covered by such licenses and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population who are covered by such licenses no later than June 14, 2023.

●With respect to the AWS H Block licenses, we committed to offer 5G broadband service to at least 20% of the U.S. population and to have deployed a core network no later than June 14, 2022, and to offer 5G broadband service to at least 70% of the U.S. population no later than June 14, 2023.

​

On June 11, 2019, a number of state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against TMUS, DT, Sprint, and SoftBank in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Southern District”), alleging that the Sprint-TMUS merger, if consummated, would violate Section 7 of the Clayton Act and therefore should be enjoined. On February 11, 2020, the Southern District ruled in favor of the Sprint-TMUS merger. If this decision is appealed by any state attorneys general, we cannot predict the timing or outcome of any such appeals process.

During 2015, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries American AWS-3 Wireless II L.L.C. (“American II”) and American AWS-3 Wireless III L.L.C. (“American III”), we initially made over $10 billion in certain non-controlling investments inNorthstar Spectrum, LLC (“Northstar Spectrum”), the parent company of Northstar Wireless, L.L.C. (“Northstar Wireless,” and collectively with Northstar Spectrum, the “Northstar Entities”), and in SNR Wireless HoldCo, LLC (“SNR HoldCo”), the parent company of SNR Wireless LicenseCo, LLC (“SNR Wireless,” and collectively with SNR HoldCo, the “SNR Entities”), respectively.On October 27, 2015, the FCC granted certain AWS-3 wireless spectrum licenses (the “AWS-3 Licenses”) to Northstar Wireless and to SNR Wireless, respectively, which are recorded in “FCC authorizations” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Under the applicable accounting guidance in Accounting Standards Codification 810,Consolidation(“ASC 810”), Northstar Spectrum and SNR HoldCo are considered variable interest entities and, based on the characteristics of the structure of these entities and in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance, we consolidate these entities into our financial statements.  See Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

The AWS-3 Licenses are subject to certain interim and final build-out requirements,as well as certain renewal requirements.  The Northstar Entities and/or the SNR Entities may need to raise significant additional capital in the future, which may be obtained from third party sources or from us, so that the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities may commercialize, build-out and integrate these AWS-3 Licenses, comply with regulations applicable to such AWS-3 Licenses, and make any potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment for the AWS-3 licenses retained by the FCC.  Depending upon the nature and scope of such commercialization, build-out, integration efforts, regulatory compliance, and potential Northstar Re-Auction Payment and SNR Re-Auction Payment, any loans, equity contributions or partnerships could vary significantly.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a profitable return on our non-controlling investments in the Northstar Entities and the SNR Entities.  See Note 15 “Commitments and Contingencies – Commitments – Wireless” in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

New Business Opportunities

​

From time to time we evaluate opportunities for strategic investments or acquisitions that may complement our current services and products, enhance our technical capabilities, improve or sustain our competitive position, or otherwise offer growth opportunities.

​

Content Delivery

​

Digital Broadcast Operations Centers.Our principal digital broadcast operations facilities are located in Cheyenne, Wyoming and Gilbert, Arizona.  We also have multiple regional and micro digital broadcast operations facilities that allow us to maximize the use of the spot beam capabilities of certain satellites.  Programming content is delivered to these facilities by fiber or satellite and processed, compressed, encrypted and then uplinked to satellites for delivery to consumers.

​

Satellites.Our DISH TV programming is primarily delivered to customers using satellites that operate in the “Ku” band portion of the microwave radio spectrum.  The Ku-band is divided into two spectrum segments.  The portion of the Ku-band that allows the use of higher power satellites (12.2 to 12.7 GHz over the United States) is known as the Broadcast Satellite Service band, which is also referred to as the DBS band.  The portion of the Ku-band that utilizes lower power satellites (11.7 to 12.2 GHz over the United States) is known as the FSS band.

​

Most of our DISH TV programming is currently delivered using DBS satellites.  To accommodate more bandwidth-intensive HD programming and other needs, we continue to explore opportunities to expand our satellite capacity through the acquisition of additional spectrum, the launching of more technologically advanced satellites, and the more efficient use of existing spectrum via, among other things, better compression technologies.

​

We own or lease capacity on 13 satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator.  For further information concerning these satellites and satellite anomalies, please see the table and discussion under“Satellites”below.

​

Conditional Access System.Our conditional access system for our DISH TV services secures our programming content using encryption so that only authorized customers can access our programming.  We use microchips embedded in credit card-sized access cards, called “smart cards,” or security chips in ourDBSreceiver systems for our DISH TV services to control access to authorized programming content (“Security Access Devices”).

​

Our signal encryption has been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future even though we continue to respond with significant investment in security measures, such as Security Access Device replacement programs and updates in security software, that are intended to make signal theft more difficult.  It has been our prior experience that security measures may only be effective for short periods of time or not at all and that we remain susceptible to additional signal theft.  We expect that future replacements of our Security Access Devices may be necessary to keep our system secure.  We cannot ensure that we will be successful in reducing or controlling theft of our programming content and we may incur additional costs in the future if our system’s security is compromised.For our Sling TV services, we encrypt programming content and use digital rights management software to, among other things, prevent unauthorized access to our programming content.

10​​




​

Content Delivery Networks.The majority of Sling TV programming content is delivered to our backhaul and uplink facilities via the internet, fiber or satellite for processing and encryption.  Our Sling TV programming content is distributed from our backhaul and uplink facilities, or directly from the content provider, to content delivery network providers for delivery to consumers via the Internet.

​

Internet Connection.Our Sling TV services require an Internet connection and are available through multiple streaming-capable devices.  Certain of our DISH TV digital set-top boxes require an Internet connection to enable full functionality, including streaming access through DISH On Demand and our DISH Anywhere app, access to dishanywhere.com and other applications.

​

Distribution Channels

​

While we offer receiver systems and programming through direct sales channels, a meaningful percentage of our gross new DISH TV subscriber activations are generated through independent third parties such as small satellite retailers, direct marketing groups, local and regional consumer electronics stores, nationwide retailers, and telecommunications companies.  In general, we pay these independent third parties a mix of upfront and monthly incentives to solicit orders for our services and provide customer service.  We offer our Sling TV services through direct sales channels and third-party marketing agreements.

​

Competition

​

Our business has historically focused on providing pay-TV services.  We face substantial competition from established pay-TV providers and broadband service providers and increasing competition from companies providing/facilitating the delivery of video content via the Internet to computers, televisions, and other streaming and mobile devices, including wireless service providers.  In recent years, the traditional pay-TV industry has matured, and industry consolidation and convergence has created competitors with greater scale and multiple product/service offerings.  These developments, among others, have contributed to intense and increasing competition, and we expect such competition to continue.

Furthermore, AT&T offers its programming, including its HBO and Cinemax channels, directly to consumers over the Internet and provides HBO for free to its subscribers under certain offers.

​

We also face increasing competition from content providers and other companies who distribute video directly to consumers over the Internet.  These content providers and other companies, as well as traditional satellite television providers, cable companies and large telecommunication companies, are rapidly increasing their Internet-based video offerings.  Programming offered over the Internet has become more prevalent and consumers are spending an increasing amount of time accessing video content via the Internet on their mobile devices.  In particular, consumers have shown increased interest in viewing certain video programming in any place, at any time and/or on any broadband-connected device they choose.

​

Video content distributed over the Internet includes services with live-linear television programming, as well as single programmer offerings and offerings of large libraries of on-demand content, including in certain cases original content.These providers include, among others, Netflix, Hulu, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Disney, Verizon, AT&T, ViacomCBS, STARZ, Fubo and Philo.Certain of these companies have invested extensive resources in producing original content that is exclusive to their platform.

​

In addition to the traditional competition we have faced, new technologies have been, and will likely continue to be, developed that further increase the number of companies with whom we compete for video subscribers.  For example, we face increasing competition from wireless telecommunications providers who offer mobile video offerings, other telephone companies who are finding ways to deliver video programming services over their wireline facilities or in a bundle with other multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), including among others, AT&T, and fiber-based networks including Google Fiber.

​

For further information see“Item 1A–Risk Factors–Competition and Economic Risks–As the pay-TV industry has matured and bundled offers combining video, broadband and/or wireless services have become more prevalent and competitive, we face intense and increasing competition from providers of video, broadband and/or wireless services, which may require us to further increase subscriber acquisition and retention spending or accept lower subscriber activations and higher subscriber churn.”and“Changing consumer behavior and competition from digital media companies that provide or facilitate the delivery of video content via the Internet may reduce our subscriber activations and may cause our subscribers to purchase fewer services from us or to cancel our services altogether, resulting in less revenue to us.”

​

Acquisition of New Subscribers

​

We incur significant upfront costs to acquire subscribers, including advertising, independent third-party retailer incentives, equipment, installation services and new customer promotions.  Certain customer promotions to acquire new subscribers result in less programming revenue to us over the promotional period.  While we attempt to recoup these upfront costs over the lives of their subscriptions, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective.  With respect to our DISH TV services, we employ business rules such as minimum credit requirements for prospective customers and contractual commitments.  We strive to provide outstanding customer service to increase the likelihood of customers keeping their Pay-TV service over longer periods of time.  Subscriber acquisition costs for Sling TV subscribers are significantly lower than those for DISH TV subscribers.  Our subscriber acquisition costs may vary significantly from period to period.

​

Advertising.We use print, radio, television and Internet media, on a local and national basis to motivate potential subscribers to contact DISH TV and Sling TV, visit our websites or contact independent third-party retailers.

​



​

12​​




Retailer Incentives.In general, we pay independent third-party retailers an upfront incentive for each new DISH TV subscriber they bring to DISH TV that results in the activation of qualified programming and generally pay independent third-party retailers small monthly incentives for up to 60 months; provided, among other things:  (i) the independent third-party retailer continuously markets, promotes and solicits orders for DISH TV products and services; (ii) the independent third-party retailer continuously provides customer service to our DISH TV subscribers; and (iii) the customer continuously subscribes to qualified programming.

​

Third-Party Marketing Agreements.We have agreements with third parties to market, promote and solicit orders for our Sling TV services generally in connection with the purchase of a streaming-capable device.  We pay a fee for each Sling TV subscriber activated under these agreements.

​

Equipment.We incur significant upfront costs to provide our new DISH TV subscribers with in-home equipment, including HD and DVR receivers, which most of our new DISH TV subscribers lease from us.  While we seek to recoup these upfront equipment costs mostly through monthly fees, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in achieving that objective.  In addition, upon deactivation of a subscriber we may refurbish and redeploy their equipment which lowers future upfront costs.  However, our ability to capitalize on these cost savings may be limited as technological advances and consumer demand for new features may render the returned equipment obsolete.

​

Installation Services.We incur significant upfront costs to install satellite dishes and receivers in the homes of our new DISH TV subscribers.

​

New Customer Promotions.We often offer our new DISH TV subscribers certain programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing during a commitment period.  We often offer our new Sling TV subscribers free trials and/or streaming-capable devices at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing.  While such promotional activities have an economic cost and reduce our subscriber-related revenue, they are not included in our definitions of subscriber acquisition costs or the DISH TV SAC metric.

​

Customer Retention

​

We incur significant costs to retain our existing DISH TV customers, mostly by upgrading their equipment to HD and DVR receivers and by providing retention credits.  As with our subscriber acquisition costs, our retention upgrade spending includes the cost of equipment and installation services.  In certain circumstances, we also offer programming at no additional charge and/or promotional pricing for limited periods for existing customers in exchange for a contractual commitment to receive service for a minimum term.  A component of our retention efforts includes the re-installation of equipment for customers who move.  Our subscriber retention costs may vary significantly from period to period.  As our Sling TV services have no contract or commitment period, we have generally not provided Sling TV subscribers with retention credits, promotional pricing, special offers or discounts.  Our retention efforts for Sling TV customers generally focuses on customer engagement and increased quality of our Sling TV services.

​

Customer Service

​

Customer Service Centers.  We use both internally-operated and outsourced customer service centers to handle calls, chat messages and e-mails from prospective and existing customers.  We strive to answer customer calls, chat messages and e-mails promptly and to resolve issues effectively on the first call, chat session or e-mail.  We also use the Internet and other applications to provide our customers with self-service capabilities.

​



Installation and Smart Home Service Operations.  High-quality installations, upgrades, and Smart Home services and repairs are critical to providing DISH TV subscribers with quality customer service.  Such services and repairs are performed by both DISH Network employees and a network of independent contractors and includes, among other things, TV mounting, appliance repair, set-up and installation of wireless networks, surround sound systems and home theaters, priority technical support, replacement equipment, cabling and power surge repairs, and installation and setup of OTA antennas.

13​​




​

Subscriber Management.  We presently use, and depend on, software systems for subscriber billing and related functions, including, among others, CSG Systems International, Inc.’s software system and Amdocs Limited software, used for the DISH TV services and Recurly, Inc.’s software system for the Sling TV services.

​

Relationship with EchoStar

​

On January1, 2008, we completed the distribution of our technology and set-top box business and certain infrastructure assets (the “Spin-off”) into a separate publicly-traded company, EchoStar.  DISH Network and EchoStar operate as separate publicly-traded companies and neither entity has any ownership interest in the other.  However, a substantial majority of the voting power of the shares of both DISH Network and EchoStar is owned beneficially by Charles W. Ergen, our Chairman, and by certain entities established by Mr.Ergen for the benefit of his family.  Furthermore, we have an authorized representative arrangement with Hughes, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EchoStar, under the MSA which offers satellite broadband Internet services to customers.  See “Item 1A. Risk Factors”and Note 19 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.

​

Share Exchange.

On February

28, 2017, we and EchoStar and certain of our respective subsidiaries completed the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement (the “Share Exchange Agreement”) that was previously entered into on January 31, 2017 (the “Share Exchange”).  Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, among other things, EchoStar transferred to us certain assets and liabilities of the EchoStar technologies and EchoStar broadcasting businesses, consisting primarily of the businesses that design, develop and distribute digital set-top boxes, provide satellite uplink services and develop and support streaming video technology, as well as certain investments in joint ventures, spectrum licenses, real estate properties and EchoStar’s ten percent non-voting interest in Sling TV Holding L.L.C. (the “Transferred Businesses”), and in exchange, we transferred to EchoStar the 6,290,499 shares of preferred tracking stock issued by EchoStar (the “EchoStar Tracking Stock”) and 81.128 shares of preferred tracking stock issued by Hughes Satellite Systems Corporation, a subsidiary of EchoStar (the “HSSC Tracking Stock,” and together with the EchoStar Tracking Stock, collectively, the “Tracking Stock”), that tracked the residential retail satellite broadband business of

.

In connection with the Share Exchange, we and EchoStar and certain of their subsidiaries entered into certain agreements covering, among other things, tax matters, employee matters, intellectual property matters and the provision of transitional services.

​

As the Share Exchange was a transaction between entities that are under common control, accounting rules require that our Consolidated Financial Statements include the results of the Transferred Businesses for all periods presented, including periods prior to the completion of the Share Exchange.  See Note 19 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on our Related Party Transactions with EchoStar for further information.

​

Master Transaction Agreement.On May 19, 2019, we and Merger Sub entered into the Master Transaction Agreement with EchoStar and Newco.  Pursuant to the Master Transaction Agreement, among other things, EchoStar transferred to us certain assets and liabilities of its EchoStar Satellite Services segment.  Effective September 10, 2019, pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Master Transaction Agreement, in consideration for the Merger, we issued 22,937,188 shares of our Class A common stock.  The transaction was structured as a tax-free spin-off and merger.  In connection with the Master Transaction Agreement, we and EchoStar and certain of their subsidiaries entered into certain agreements covering, among other things, tax matters, employee matters, intellectual property matters and the provision of transitional services.

SATELLITES

​

Pay-TV Satellites.  Most of our DISH TV programming is currently delivered using DBS satellites.  We continue to explore opportunities to expand our available satellite capacity through the use of other available spectrum.  Increasing our available spectrum is particularly important as more bandwidth intensive HD programming is produced and to address new video and data applications consumers may desire in the future.  We currently utilize 13 satellites in geostationary orbit approximately 22,300 miles above the equator as detailed in the table below.

Satellite Anomalies

​

Operation of our DISH TV services requires that we have adequate satellite transmission capacity for the programming that we offer.  While we generally have had in-orbit satellite capacity sufficient to transmit our existing channels and some backup capacity to recover the transmission of certain critical programming, our backup capacity is limited.

​

In the event of a failure or loss of any of our owned or leased satellites, we may need to acquire or lease additional satellite capacity or relocate one of our other owned or leased satellites and use it as a replacement for the failed or lost satellite.  Such a failure could result in a prolonged loss of critical programming or a significant delay in our plans to expand programming as necessary to remain competitive and thus may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

​

In the past, certain of our owned and leased satellites have experienced anomalies, some of which have had a significant adverse impact on their remaining useful life and/or commercial operation.  There can be no assurance that future anomalies will not impact the remaining useful life and/or commercial operation of any of the owned and leased satellites in our fleet.  See “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” in Note 2 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form10-K for further information on evaluation of impairment.  There can be no assurance that we can recover critical transmission capacity in the event one or more of our owned or leased in-orbit satellites were to fail.  We generally do not carry commercial launch or in-orbit insurance on any of the satellites that we own and therefore, we will bear the risk associated with any uninsured launch or in-orbit satellite failures.

​

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS

​



Our operations, particularly our Pay-TV operations and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to significant government regulation and oversight, primarily by the FCC and, to a certain extent, by Congress, other federal agencies and international, foreign, state and local authorities.  Depending on the circumstances, noncompliance with legislation or regulations promulgated by these authorities could result in limitations on, or the suspension or revocation of, our licenses or registrations, the termination or loss of contracts or the imposition of contractual damages, civil fines or criminal penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  These governmental authorities could also adopt regulations or take other actions that would adversely affect our business prospects.

​

Furthermore, the Administration and any government policy changes it may institute, which may be substantial, could increase regulatory uncertainty.  The adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to video programming distribution, satellite services, wireless telecommunications, broadband, the Internet, or other areas of our business could limit or otherwise adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our business.  In addition, the manner in which regulations or legislation in these areas may be interpreted and enforced cannot be precisely determined, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

​

16​​




​

Wireless services and our wireless spectrum licenses are subject to regulation by the FCC and, depending on the jurisdiction, other federal, state and local, as well as international, governmental authorities and regulatory agencies, including, among other things, regulations governing the licensing, construction, operation, sale and interconnection arrangements of wireless telecommunications systems.  In particular, the FCC imposes significant regulation on licensees of wireless spectrum with respect to how radio spectrum is used by licensees, the nature of the services that licensees may offer and how the services may be offered, and resolution of issues of interference between spectrum bands.  The FCC grants wireless licenses for terms of generally 10-12 years that are subject to renewal or revocation.  There can be no assurances that our wireless spectrum licenses will be renewed.  Failure to comply with FCC build-out requirements in a given license area may result in acceleration of other build-out requirements or in the modification, cancellation, or non-renewal of licenses.  For further information related to our licenses and build-out requirements related to our wireless spectrum licenses see “
