Dentsply Sirona dates its history back to 1886. The Company is a designer, developer, manufacturer and marketer of a broad range of consumable dental products and technologically-advanced dental equipment. The Company also manufactures and markets healthcare consumable products. The Company introduced the first dental electric drill over 130 years ago, the first dental X-ray unit approximately 100 years ago, the first dental computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing (“CAD/CAM”) system over 30 years ago, and numerous other significant innovations including pioneering ultrasonic scaling to increase the speed, effectiveness and comfort of cleaning and revolutionizing both file and apex locater technology to make root canal procedures easier and safer. Dentsply Sirona continues to make significant investments in research and development (“R&D”), and its track record of innovative and profitable new products continues today.



Dental products and technology and equipment accounted for approximately 92% of both Dentsply Sirona’s consolidated net sales and consolidated net sales, excluding precious metal content, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The remaining net sales are primarily related to consumable medical device products. The presentation of net sales, excluding precious metal content, is considered a measure not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“US GAAP”), and is therefore considered a non-US GAAP measure. This non-US GAAP measure is discussed further in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K and a reconciliation of net sales to net sales, excluding precious metal content, is provided there.

Net sales of dental consumable products accounted for approximately 42%, 43% and 42% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.



Technologies & Equipment Segment



Dental Technology and Equipment Products



Dental technology products consist of basic and high-tech dental equipment such as treatment centers, imaging equipment, dental handpieces, and computer aided design and machining CAD/CAM systems equipment for dental practitioners. The product category also includes high-tech state-of-art dental implants and related scanning equipment and treatment software, and orthodontic clear aligners and appliances for dental practitioners and specialists. The Company offers the broadest line of products to fully outfit a dental practitioner’s office.








Treatment centers comprise a broad range of products from basic dentist chairs to sophisticated chair-based units with integrated diagnostic, hygiene and ergonomic functionalities, as well as specialist centers used in preventive treatment and for training purposes. Imaging equipment consist of a broad range of diagnostic imaging systems for 2D or 3D, panoramic, and intra-oral applications. Dental CAD/CAM systems equipment are products designed for dental offices used for dental restorations, such as inlays, onlays, veneers, crowns, bridges, copings and bridge frameworks made from ceramic, metal or composite blocks. This product line also includes high-tech chairside economical restoration of aesthetic ceramic dentistry, or CEREC equipment. This equipment allows for in-office application that enables dentists to produce high quality restorations from ceramic material and insert them into the patient’s mouth during a single appointment. CEREC has a number of advantages compared to the traditional out-of-mouth pre-shaped restoration method, as CEREC does not require a physical model, restorations can be created in the dentist’s office and the procedure can be completed in a single visit. The Company estimates that at December 31, 2019 the market penetration for in-office CAD/CAM systems in the U.S. and Germany wasapproximately 18%.



Net sales of dental technology and equipment products accounted for approximately 50%, 48% and 50% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.



Healthcare Consumable Products



Healthcare consumable products consist mainly of urology catheters, medical drills and other non-medical products.



Net sales of healthcare consumable products accounted for approximately 8%, 9% and 8% of the Company’s consolidated net sales for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.



Markets, Sales and Distribution



The Company believes that the market for its products will grow over the long-term based on the following factors:



•increasing worldwide population.



•aging population in developed countries with access to greater amounts of discretionary income will require more dental care.



•natural teeth are being retained longer - individuals with natural teeth are much more likely to visit a dentist in a given year than those without any natural teeth remaining.



•earlier preventive care and a growing demand for aesthetic dentistry - dentistry has evolved from a profession primarily dealing with pain, infections and tooth decay to one with increased emphasis on preventive care and cosmetic dentistry.



•increasing demands for patient comfort and ease of product use and handling.



•increasing demand for more efficiency and better workflow in the dental office, including digital and integrated solutions.



•per capita and discretionary incomes are increasing in emerging markets. As personal incomes continue to rise in emerging economies, healthcare, including dental services, is a growing priority. Many surveys indicate the middle class population will expand significantly within these emerging markets.



•the Company’s business is less susceptible than many other industries to general downturns in the economies in which it operates. Many of the products the Company offers relate to dental procedures and health conditions that are considered necessary by patients regardless of the economic environment. Dental specialty products, dental equipment and products that support discretionary dental procedures are the most susceptible to changes in economic conditions.



Dentsply Sirona employs approximately 4,800 highly trained, product-specific sales and technical staff to provide comprehensive marketing and service tailored to the particular sales and technical support requirements of its distributors, dealers and the end-users.








Dental Sales and Distribution



Dentsply Sirona distributes approximately two-thirds of its dental consumable and technology and equipment products through third-party distributors. Certain highly technical products such as dental technology equipment, dental ceramics, crown and bridge porcelain products, endodontic instruments and materials, orthodontic clear aligners and appliances, and dental implants are often sold directly to the dental laboratory or dental professionals in some markets. For the year ended December 31, 2019, only one customer, Henry Schein, Inc (“Henry Schein”), accounted for more than 10%, or approximately 13% of consolidated net sales. At December 31, 2019, two customers, Henry Schein and Patterson Companies, Inc. (“Patterson”), each accounted for more then 10%, or approximately 12% and 17%, respectively, of the consolidated accounts receivable balance. For the year ended December 31, 2018, only one customer, Henry Schein, accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated net sales. At December 31, 2018, two customers, Henry Schein and Patterson, accounted for approximately 10% and 13%, respectively, of the consolidated accounts receivable balance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, only one customer, Henry Schein, accounted for more then 10%, or approximately 15% of consolidated net sales.



In 2018 and 2017 the Company was impacted by the transition in distribution strategy with Patterson and Henry Schein. In 2017, the Company signed new distribution agreements with Patterson and Henry Schein for the Company’s equipment products. The Company shipped initial stocking orders for the equipment products to Henry Schein under the agreements primarily in the second and third quarters of 2017 which resulted in unfavorable year-over-year sales growth comparisons. Based on the Company’s estimate, year-over-year changes in distributor inventories associated with these agreements negatively impacted the Company’s reported sales growth for the year ended December 31, 2018 by approximately $127 million. Based on the Company’s estimate, distributor inventories increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 by approximately $27 million as compared to a decrease of approximately $100 million for the full year 2018.



Although many of its dental sales are made to distributors, dealers and importers, Dentsply Sirona focuses much of its marketing efforts on the dentists, dental hygienists, dental assistants, dental laboratories and dental schools which are the end-users of its products. As part of this end-user “pull through” marketing approach, the Company conducts extensive distributor, dealer and end-user marketing programs. Additionally, the Company trains laboratory technicians, dental hygienists, dental assistants and dentists in the proper use of its products and introduces them to the latest technological developments at its educational courses conducted throughout the world. The Company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various dental associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in the dental field.



The Company's focus includes the creation of more meaningful solutions for dentists built around the following five key operating principals:



•Approach customers as one:Put the customer at the center of how Dentsply Sirona is organized. The Company is creating one integrated approach to customer service, direct and indirect selling, and clinical education to strengthen the relationship with the customer and better serve the customers' needs.



•Assume greater responsibility for Dentsply Sirona’s demand creation:To better support dealer partners and end-user customers, the Company launched a sales force effectiveness program, with a view to improving returns on sales and marketing investments.



•Ensure that innovation is substantial and supported:Create a comprehensive R&D program that prioritizes spending across the entire Company portfolio resulting in more impactful innovations each year.



•Lead in clinical education:Dentsply Sirona is investing to further its leadership position through local training events and enhancing online training presence to strengthen the relationship with the dental professionals.



•Take advantage of scale:The Company is focused on integrating its dental product portfolios to unlock operational efficiencies, including performance improvements in procurement, logistics, manufacturing, sales force and marketing programs. In addition, Dentsply Sirona is taking significant measures to simplify the business. In combination, these initiatives will improve organizational efficiency and better leverage the Company’s selling, general and administrative infrastructure.



Medical Sales and Distribution



The Company’s urology products are sold directly in approximately 15 countries throughout Europe and North America, and through distributors in approximately 20 additional markets. The Company’s largest markets include the UK, Germany and France. Key customers include urologists, urology nurses, general practitioners and direct-to-patients.








Historical reimbursement levels within Europe have been higher for intermittent catheters which explain a greater penetration of single-use catheter products in that market. In the United States, which the Company considers an important growth market, the reimbursement environment has improved as third-party payers have recognized the cost benefits of infection control through the use of disposable catheters.



The Company also maintains ongoing consulting and educational relationships with various medical associations and recognized worldwide opinion leaders in this field.



Product Development



Innovation and successful product development are critical to keeping market leadership position in key product categories and growing market share in other products categories while strengthening the Company’s prominence in the dental and medical markets that it serves. While many of Dentsply Sirona’s existing products undergo brand extensions, the Company also continues to focus efforts on successfully launching innovative products that have a more significant impact on how dental and clinical professionals treat their patients.



New advances in technology are also anticipated to have a significant influence on future products in dentistry and in select areas of healthcare. As a result, the Company pursues research and development initiatives to support this technological development, including collaborations with external research institutions, dental and medical schools. Through its own internal research centers as well as through its collaborations with external research institutions, dental and medical schools, the Company directly invests in the development of new products, improvement of existing products and advances in technology. The continued development of these areas is a critical step in meeting the Company’s strategic goal as a leader in defining the future of dentistry and in select areas in health care.



In addition to the direct investment in product development and improvement, the Company also invests in these activities through acquisitions, by entering into licensing agreements with third parties, and by purchasing technologies developed by third parties.



Acquisition Activities



Dentsply Sirona believes that the dental consumable and technology products industries continue to experience consolidation with respect to both product manufacturing and distribution, although they remain fragmented thereby creating a number of acquisition opportunities.



The Company views acquisitions as a key part of its growth strategy. These acquisition activities are intended to supplement the Company’s core growth and assure ongoing expansion of its business, including new technologies, additional products, organizational strength and geographic breadth. Information regarding the Company's acquisition activity for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 can be found in Note 4, Business Combinations, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.



Operating and Technical Expertise



Dentsply Sirona believes that its manufacturing capabilities are important to its success. The manufacturing processes of the Company’s products require substantial and varied technical expertise.

Competition



The Company conducts its operations, both domestic and foreign, under highly competitive market conditions. Competition in the dental and healthcare consumable products and dental technology and equipment products industries is based primarily upon product performance, quality, safety and ease of use, as well as price, customer service, innovation and acceptance by clinicians, technicians and patients. Dentsply Sirona believes that its principal strengths include its well-established brand names, its reputation for high quality and innovative products, its leadership in product development and manufacturing, its global sales force, the breadth of its product line and distribution network, its commitment to customer satisfaction and support of the Company’s products by dental and medical professionals.



The size and number of the Company’s competitors vary by product line and from region to region. There are many companies that produce some, but no competitor produces all, of the same types of products as those produced by the Company.



Regulation



The development, manufacture, sale and distribution of the Company’s products are subject to comprehensive governmental regulation both within and outside the United States. The following sections describe certain, but not all, of the significant regulations that apply to the Company. For a description of the risks related to the regulations that the Company is subject to, please refer to Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.



The majority of the Company’s products are classified as medical devices and are subject to restrictions under domestic and foreign laws, rules, regulations, self-regulatory codes, circulars and orders, including, but not limited to, the United States Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”), Council Directive 93/42/EEC on Medical Devices (“MDD”) (1993) in the European Union, which will be updated to the European Union Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”) in 2020 (and implementing and local measures adopted thereunder) and similar international laws and regulations. The FDCA requires these products, when sold in the United States, to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with the regulations administered by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Certain medical device products are also regulated by comparable agencies in non-U.S. countries in which they are produced or sold.



Dental and medical devices of the types sold by Dentsply Sirona are generally classified by the FDA into a category that renders them subject to the same controls that apply to all medical devices, including regulations regarding alteration, misbranding, notification, record-keeping and good manufacturing practices. In the European Union, Dentsply Sirona’s products are subject to the medical devices laws of the various member states, which are based on a Directive of the European Commission. Such laws generally regulate the safety of the products in a similar way to the FDA regulations. Dentsply Sirona products in Europe bear the CE mark showing that such products comply with European regulations.
















The Company believes it is in substantial compliance with the laws and regulations that regulate its business.There are, however, significant uncertainties involving the application of various legal requirements, the violation of which could result in, among other things, sanctions. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for additional detail.








Sources and Supply of Raw Materials and Finished Goods



The Company manufactures the majority of the products that it sells. Most of the raw materials used by the Company in the manufacture of its products are purchased from various suppliers and are typically available from numerous sources. No single supplier accounts for more than 10% of Dentsply Sirona’s supply requirements. The Company sources some raw materials from China. In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus surfaced in China, which may impact the Company's ability to source such raw materials.



Intellectual Property



Products manufactured by Dentsply Sirona are sold primarily under its own tradenames and trademarks. Dentsply Sirona also owns and maintains more than 4,000 patents throughout the world and is licensed under a number of patents owned by others.



Dentsply Sirona’s policy is to protect its products and technology through patents and trademark registrations both in the U.S. and in significant international markets. The Company monitors trademark use worldwide and promotes enforcement of its patents and trademarks in a manner that is designed to balance the cost of such protection against obtaining the greatest value for the Company. Dentsply Sirona believes its patents and trademark properties are important and contribute to the Company’s marketing position but it does not consider its overall business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark. Additional information regarding certain risks related to our intellectual property is included in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K and is incorporated herein by reference.



Employees



At December 31, 2019, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 15,200 employees. Of these employees, approximately 3,700 were employed in the United States and approximately 11,500 outside the United States. Some of the Company's employees outside of the United States are covered by collective bargaining, union contract, worker councils, or other similar type programs. The Company believes that it generally has a positive relationship with its employees.



Environmental Matters



Dentsply Sirona believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Maintaining this level of compliance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on the Company’s capital expenditures or on its business. Dentsply Sirona also believes that policies and procedures intended to promote Company operations and product development that meet its standards for sustainability and environmental stewardship will result in better communities and a better planet but will also deliver value to its customers, employees, and shareholders by increasing efficiency and sustainability in its operations.



Other Factors Affecting the Business



The Company’s business is subject to quarterly fluctuations of consolidated net sales, net income and cash flows. The Company typically implements most of its price changes in the beginning of the first or fourth quarter. Price changes, other marketing and promotional programs including trade shows, management of inventory levels by distributors and the implementation of strategic initiatives, may impact sales levels in a given period. In addition, major new product introductions may also impact net sales as older products become less desirable compared to the new products. Sales for the industry and the Company are generally strongest in the second and fourth calendar quarters and weaker in the first and third calendar quarters, due to the effects of the items noted above and due to the impact of holidays and vacations, particularly throughout Europe.



The Company tries to maintain short lead times within its manufacturing, as such, the backlog on products is generally not material to the financial statements.
