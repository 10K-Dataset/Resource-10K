Raw Materials and Suppliers

Carpet Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of carpet and rugs are nylon, triexta, polyester, polypropylene, recycled post-consumer plastics, synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals, all of which are petroleum based. Major raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are available from independent sources, and the Company obtains most of its externally purchased fibers and resins from nine major suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. Although the market for carpet raw materials is sensitive to temporary disruptions, the carpet and rug business has not experienced a significant shortage of raw materials in recent years.

Ceramic Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of ceramic tile are clay, talc, industrial minerals and glazes.  The Company has long-term clay mining rights in the U.S. and Russia that satisfy a significant amount of its clay requirements for producing quarry tile. The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its non-quarry tile.   The Company has entered into long-term supply agreements for a portion of its talc requirements. Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tiles.  Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures a significant amount of its frit requirements.  The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay, talc and industrial minerals that are readily available from a number of independent sources.  If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available.

Laminate and Wood Segment

The principal raw materials used in producing boards, laminate and hardwood flooring are wood, paper, resins, coatings and stains. Wood supply is a very fragmented market in Europe. The Company has long-standing relationships with numerous suppliers. These suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species, varying from fresh round wood to several kinds of by-products of sawmills and recycled wood, giving the Company a cost-effective and secure supply of raw material. In the U.S., the Company has a long-term contract with a contiguously located lumber company that supplies most of its total needs for HDF board production. The supply of various species of hardwoods and hardwood veneers used in the production of solid wood and engineered flooring is both localized and global.

Major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate flooring business.. The Company processes most of the paper impregnation internally in its laminate flooring facilities.  In Europe, the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by the Company, which permits greater control over the laminate flooring manufacturing process.  The Company buys the balance of its resin requirements from a number of companies. The Company believes there are ample sources of supply of paper and resin located within a reasonable distance of the Laminate and Wood segment’s facilities.

Industry and Competition

The Company is the largest flooring manufacturer in a fragmented industry composed of a wide variety of companies from small privately held firms to large multinationals.  In2012, the U.S. floor covering industry reported $18.8 billion in sales, up 4.8% over 2011's sales of $17.9 billion.  In 2012, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on sales, were carpet and rug (52%), resilient and rubber (14%), ceramic tile (13%), hardwood (10%), stone (6%) and laminate (5%).  In 2012, the primary categories of flooring in the U.S., based on square feet, were carpet and rug (56%), resilient and rubber (19%), ceramic tile (12%), hardwood (6%), laminate (5%) and stone (2%).  In 2011, the world floor covering industry reported $194.8 billion






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



in sales.  In 2011, the primary categories of flooring throughout the world,  based on square meters, were ceramic tile (36%), carpet and rug (27%), resilient and rubber (13%),  hardwood (8%), laminate (7%) and other nonresilient (8%).  Each of these categories is influenced by the residential builder and homeowner remodeling markets, housing starts and housing resales, average house size and home ownership. In addition, the level of sales in the floor covering industry is influenced by consumer confidence, spending for durable goods, interest rates and availability of credit, turnover in housing, the condition of the residential and commercial construction industries and the overall strength of the economy.

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines. The Company’s investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and distribution network, as well as the Company’s marketing strategy, contribute to its ability to compete on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just price.

Carpet Segment

The carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top five North American carpet and rug manufacturers (including their North American and foreign divisions) in2012had carpet and rug sales in excess of $6.8 billion of the over $10.6 billion market. The Company believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs (in terms of sales dollars) in the world based on its2012net sales.

Ceramic Segment

The ceramic tile industry is significantly more fragmented than the carpet industry. The Company faces competition in the ceramic tile flooring channel from a large number of foreign and domestic manufacturers who all compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers. The Company believes it is the largest manufacturer, distributor and marketer of ceramic tile in the world.

Laminate and Wood Segment

The Company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers.  The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers, distributors and licensors of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of hardwood flooring in the U.S.  In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the laminate flooring channel as a result of the Laminate and Wood segment’s industry leading design, patented technologies and brands, which allow the Company to distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish, quality, installation and assembly.

Patents and Trademarks

Intellectual property is important to the Company’s business, and the Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its interests.

The Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of its products, including Aladdin, American Olean, Bigelow, Century Flooring, Columbia Flooring, Dal-Tile, Duracolor®, didit, Durkan, Elka®, Everset fibers®, Horizon, Karastan, Kerama Marazzi, Lees, Marazzi, Mohawk, Mohawk ColorCenter, Mohawk Floorscapes, Mohawk GreenWorks®, Mohawk Home, Pergo, Portico, PureBond®, Quick-Step, Ragno, SmartStrand, Ultra Performance System®,  UNICLIC, UNILIN®, Utherm®and Wear-Dated®. These trademarks represent innovations that highlight competitive advantages and provide differentiation from competing brands in the market.

The Laminate and Wood segment owns a number of important patent families in Europe and the U.S. some of which the Company licenses to manufacturers and distributors throughout the world.  The most important of these patent families is the UNICLIC family, which include the snap, pretension, clearance and the beveled edge patent.  The UNICLIC family of patents is expected to expire in 2017.  The Company continues to explore additional opportunities to generate revenue from its patent portfolio including, potential licensing opportunities related to Pergo's “clicking” technology.  The Company believes potential revenue from newly acquired intellectual property along with other ongoing innovations will partially offset the impact of the future expiration of the UNICLIC family patents. The licensing revenue from patents included in the Laminate and Wood segment's results were approximately €87 million and €80 million in 2013 and 2012, respectively.  The licensing revenue from patents generated in the Laminate and Wood segment's operations is partially offset by various expenses such as amortization, developing new technologies, filing new patents, supporting existing patents, defending patent lawsuits, collection and auditing of receivables, bad debt and other administrative activities. The Company continues to build upon these patents, trademarks and its proven innovation in pursuing growth opportunities.

Sales Terms and Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are substantially the same as those generally available throughout the industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return products purchased from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product.

During2013, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales, and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 20% of the Company’s net sales. The Company believes the loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As ofDecember 31, 2013, the Company employed approximately 32,100 persons consisting of approximately 23,100 in North America, approximately 4,500 in Europe, approximately 3,400 in Russia, approximately 1,000 in Malaysia and approximately 100 in various other countries. The majority of the Company’s European and Mexican manufacturing employees are members of unions. Most of the Company’s U.S. employees are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement.
