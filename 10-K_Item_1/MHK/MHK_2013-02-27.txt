The Company also continues to rely on the substantial brand name recognition of its product lines. The cost of point-of-sale displays and product samples, a significant promotional expense, is partially offset by sales of samples to customers.

Manufacturing and Operations

Mohawk Segment

The Company’s carpet and rug manufacturing operations are vertically integrated and include the extrusion of resin and post-consumer plastics into triexta fiber, polyester, nylon and polypropylene, and yarn processing, backing manufacturing, tufting, weaving, dyeing, coating and finishing. The Mohawk segment continues to invest in capital expenditures, principally in state-of-the-art equipment, to increase manufacturing efficiency, improve overall cost competitiveness and develop new capabilities.

Dal-Tile Segment

The Company’s tile manufacturing operations are vertically integrated from the production of raw material for body and glaze preparation to the manufacturing and distribution of ceramic and porcelain tile in the U.S. and Mexico. The Company believes that its manufacturing organization offers competitive advantages due to its ability to manufacture a differentiated product line consisting of one of the industry’s broadest product offerings of colors, textures and finishes and its ability to utilize the industry’s newest technology, as well as the industry’s largest offering of trim and angle pieces. In addition, Dal-Tile also imports or sources a portion of its product to supplement its product offerings. The Dal-Tile segment continues to invest in capital expenditures, principally in state-of-the-art equipment, to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency and develop new capabilities. The segment is expanding its international presence through investments in China and Mexico and through the pending acquisition of the Marazzi Group in Europe and Russia.

Unilin Segment

The Company’s laminate flooring manufacturing operations are vertically integrated, both in the U.S. and in Europe, and include high-density fiberboard (“HDF”) production, paper impregnation, short-cycle pressing, cutting and milling. The European operations also include resin production. Unilin has state-of-the-art equipment that results in competitive manufacturing in terms of cost and flexibility. In addition, Unilin has significant manufacturing capability for both engineered and prefinished solid wood flooring for the U.S. and European markets. The Unilin segment continues to invest in capital expenditures, principally in new plants and state-of-the-art equipment, to increase manufacturing capacity, improve efficiency and develop new capabilities. The segment is expanding its international presence through investments in Australia, Brazil, France and Russia, and with the recent acquisition of Pergo, the Nordic countries and India. The manufacturing facilities for other activities in the Unilin business (roofing systems, insulation panels and other wood products) are all configured for cost-efficient manufacturing and production flexibility and are competitive in the European market.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Mohawk Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of carpet and rugs are nylon, triexta, polyester, polypropylene, synthetic backing materials, latex and various dyes and chemicals, all of which are petroleum based. Major raw materials used in the Company’s manufacturing process are available from independent sources, and the Company obtains most of its externally purchased fibers and resins principally from six major suppliers. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. Although the market for carpet raw materials is sensitive to temporary disruptions, the carpet and rug business has not experienced a significant shortage of raw materials in recent years.






Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements



Dal-Tile Segment

The principal raw materials used in the production of ceramic tile are clay, talc, nepheline syenite and glazes. The Company has entered into a long-term supply agreement for most of its talc requirements. In addition, the Company has long-term clay mining rights in Kentucky and Mississippi that satisfy nearly all of its clay requirements for producing quarry tile. The Company purchases a number of different grades of clay for the manufacture of its non-quarry tile. The Company believes that there is an adequate supply of all grades of clay and that all are readily available from a number of independent sources. The Company has two suppliers for its nepheline syenite requirements. If these suppliers were unable to satisfy the requirements, the Company believes that alternative supply arrangements would be available. Glazes are used on a significant percentage of manufactured tiles. Glazes consist of frit (ground glass), zircon, stains and other materials, with frit being the largest ingredient. The Company manufactures approximately 75% of its frit requirements.

Unilin Segment

The principal raw materials used in producing boards, laminate and hardwood flooring are wood, paper, resins, coatings and stains. Wood supply is a very fragmented market in Europe. The Company has long-standing relationships with numerous suppliers. These suppliers provide a wide variety of wood species, varying from fresh round wood to several kinds of by-products of sawmills and used wood recycled specifically for chipboard production, giving the Company a cost-effective and secure supply of raw material. In the U.S., the Company has a long-term contract with a contiguously located lumber company that supplies most of its total needs for HDF board production. The supply of various species of hardwoods and hardwood veneers used in the production of solid wood and engineered flooring is both localized and global.

Major manufacturers supply the papers required in the laminate flooring business in both Europe and the U.S. The Company processes most of the paper impregnation internally in its laminate flooring facilities in Europe and the U.S. In Europe, the resins for paper impregnation are manufactured by the Company, which permits greater control over the laminate flooring manufacturing process, enabling the Company to produce higher-quality products. The Company buys the balance of its resin requirements from a number of companies. The Company believes there are ample sources of supply located within a reasonable distance of Unilin’s facilities.

Competition

The principal methods of competition within the floor covering industry generally are service, style, quality, price, product innovation and technology. In each of the markets, price competition and market coverage are particularly important because there is limited differentiation among competing product lines. The Company’s investments in manufacturing equipment, computer systems and distribution network, as well as the Company’s marketing strategy, contribute to its ability to compete primarily on the basis of performance, quality, style and service, rather than just price.

Mohawk Segment

The carpet and rug industry is highly competitive. Based on industry publications, the top five North American carpet and rug manufacturers (including their North American and foreign divisions) in2011had carpet and rug sales in excess of $7.1 billion of the over $9.9 billion market. The Company believes it is the second largest producer of carpets and rugs (in terms of sales dollars) in the world based on its2011net sales.

Dal-Tile Segment

The ceramic tile industry is significantly more fragmented than the carpet industry. The Company estimates that over 100 tile manufacturers, more than half of which are based outside the U.S., compete for sales of ceramic tile to customers located in the U.S. Although the U.S. ceramic tile industry is highly fragmented at both the manufacturing and distribution levels, the Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers, distributors and marketers of ceramic tile in the world. The Company believes it is substantially larger than the next largest competitor in the United States and that it is the only significant manufacturer with its own North American distribution system.

Unilin Segment

The Company faces competition in the laminate and hardwood flooring channel from a large number of domestic and foreign manufacturers. The Company estimates that there are over 100 wood flooring manufacturers located in various countries. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers, distributors and licensors of laminate flooring in the world, with a focus on high-end products. The Company believes it is one of the largest manufacturers and distributors of hardwood flooring in the U.S. In addition, the Company believes it has a competitive advantage in the laminate flooring channel as a result of Unilin’s industry leading design, patented technologies and brands, which allows the Company to

distinguish its laminate and hardwood flooring products in the areas of finish, quality, installation and assembly and provides a source of additional revenue for the Company from licensing royalties.

Patents and Trademarks

Intellectual property is important to the Company’s business, and the Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect its interests.

The Company uses several trademarks that it considers important in the marketing of its products, including Aladdin, American Olean, Bigelow, Century Flooring, Columbia Flooring, Dal-Tile, Duracolor®, didit, Durkan, Elka®, Everset fibers®, Horizon, Karastan, Lees, Merit, Mohawk, Mohawk ColorCenter, Mohawk Floorscapes, Mohawk GreenWorks®, Mohawk Home, Pergo, Portico, PureBond®, Quick-Step, SmartStrand, Ultra Performance System®,  UNICLIC, UNILIN®, Utherm®and Wear-Dated®. These trademarks represent innovations that highlight competitive advantages and provide differentiation from competing brands in the market.

Sales Terms and Major Customers

The Company’s sales terms are substantially the same as those generally available throughout the industry. The Company generally permits its customers to return products purchased from it within specified time periods from the date of sale, if the customer is not satisfied with the quality of the product.

During2012, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of total net sales, and the top 10 customers accounted for less than 20% of the Company’s net sales. The Company believes the loss of one major customer would not have a material adverse effect on its business.

Employees

As ofDecember 31, 2012, the Company employed approximately 25,100 persons consisting of approximately 18,200 in the U.S., approximately 3,600 in Mexico, approximately 2,200 in Europe, approximately 800 in Malaysia, approximately 200 in Canada and approximately 100 in Russia. The majority of the Company’s European and Mexican manufacturing employees are members of unions. Most of the Company’s U.S. employees are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement. Additionally, the Company has not experienced any strikes or work stoppages in recent years. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are good.
