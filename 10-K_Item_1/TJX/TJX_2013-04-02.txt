ITEM 1. Business

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide. Our over 3,000 stores
offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand-name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices, every day.

Our stores are known for our value proposition of brand, fashion, quality and price and offer a treasure hunt shopping experience through the rapid
turn of inventories relative to traditional retailers. Our goal is to create a sense of excitement and urgency for our customers and encourage frequent customer visits. We reach a broad range of customers across many income levels and other
demographic groups with our value proposition. Our strategies and operating platforms are synergistic across all of our retail chains. As a result, we are able to leverage our expertise throughout our business, sharing information, best practices,
initiatives and new ideas, and developing talent across our Company. We also leverage the substantial buying power of our businesses in our global relationships with vendors.

Our Businesses. We operate our business in four major divisions: Marmaxx and HomeGoods, both in the U.S., TJX Canada and TJX Europe.

MARMAXX:

Our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains in the United States (referred to together as The
Marmaxx Group or Marmaxx) are collectively the largest off-price retailer in the United States with a total of 1,940 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including footwear and
accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise. We primarily differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through different product assortment
(including an expanded assortment of fine jewelry and accessories and a designer section called The Runway at T.J. Maxx and a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering and a juniors’ department called The Cube at Marshalls) and
in-store initiatives. This differentiated shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both chains. We intend to launch, in a small, controlled mode, a T.J. Maxx website in fiscal 2014.

HOMEGOODS:

Our HomeGoods chain, introduced
in 1992, is the leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through its 415 stores, HomeGoods offers a broad array of home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories from around the world,
seasonal and other merchandise.

TJX CANADA:

Our TJX Canada division operates the Winners, Marshalls and HomeSense chains in Canada. Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. The merchandise offering at
its 222 stores across Canada is comparable to T.J. Maxx. We opened our HomeSense chain in 2001, bringing the home fashions off-price concept to Canada. HomeSense has 88 stores with a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to HomeGoods. We brought
Marshalls to Canada in fiscal 2012 and operate 14 Marshalls stores in Canada. Like Marshalls in the U.S., our Canadian Marshalls stores offer an expanded footwear department and The Cube juniors’ department, differentiating them from Winners
stores.

TJX EUROPE:

Our TJX
Europe division operates the T.K. Maxx and HomeSense chains in Europe. Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced off-price to Europe and remains Europe’s only major off-price retailer of apparel and home






fashions. With 343 stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K., Ireland, Germany and Poland. Through its stores and, for the U.K, an online website, T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J.
Maxx, Marshalls and Winners. We brought the off-price home fashions concept to Europe, opening HomeSense in the U.K. in 2008. Its 24 stores in the U.K. offer a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense
in Canada.

In December 2012, we acquired Sierra Trading Post, an off-price on-line retailer of apparel and home fashions, which we are
maintaining as a separate banner.

Flexible Business Model.Our flexible off-price business model, including
our opportunistic buying, inventory management, logistics and store layouts, is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable quality brand-name and designer merchandise at excellent values. Our buying and inventory
management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. Our merchants have more
visibility into consumer, fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need, which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure. Our selling floor space is flexible, without walls between departments and
largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase. Our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick,
efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores, with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times.

Opportunistic Buying.As an off-price retailer, our buying practices, which we refer to as opportunistic buying, differentiate us from traditional retailers. Our overall opportunistic
buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded, designer and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable
merchandise at department and specialty stores. We seek out and select from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end. Our buying organization, which numbers over 800 individuals in 13 buying offices in ten countries,
executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways, depending on market conditions and other factors.

Our expansive vendor universe is in excess of 16,000, consists primarily of manufacturers along with retailers and others, and provides us
substantial and diversified access to merchandise. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to
grow. We believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise. We are typically willing to purchase less-than-full assortments of items,
styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large; we are able to disperse merchandise across our






geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets; we pay promptly; and we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown
allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or return privileges. We provide vendors an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating.

Inventory Management.We offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt
experience in our stores and spur customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning,
purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics, achieve rapid in-store
inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned. We make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally, using information provided by specialized computer
systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels, to ship more
efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store.

Pricing.Our mission is to offer quality, fashionable, brand-name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular retail prices, every day. We do not generally engage in
promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons. We have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise
margins through various economic cycles.

Low Cost Operations.We operate with a low cost structure compared
to many traditional retailers. We focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business. Our advertising is generally focused on our banners rather than individual products, including at times promoting all banners in each division together, which
contributes to our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remaining low compared to many traditional retailers. We design our stores to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping environment but, relative to other retailers, do not spend heavily
on store fixtures. Additionally, our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively.

Customer Service/Shopping
Experience.We are in the process of renovating and upgrading stores across our banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales. Although we offer a self-service format, we train our store associates to
provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience. We typically offer customer-friendly return policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit
cards, and offer TJX-branded credit cards in the U.S. through a bank, but do not own the customer receivables.

Distribution.We operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 11 million square feet in five
countries. These centers are large, highly automated and built to suit our specific, off-price business model. We ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers
operated by third parties. We shipped approximately 2.0 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2013.






Store Growth.Expansion of our business through the addition of new stores
continues to be an important part of our growth strategy. The following table provides information on the store growth of our four divisions in the last two fiscal years, our growth estimates for fiscal 2014 and our estimates of the store growth
potential of the current chains in these divisions in their current geographies:

A.J. Wright Consolidation.In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed the consolidation of A.J.
Wright, our former off-price chain targeting lower middle income customers, converting 90 of the A.J. Wright stores to






T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods banners and closing A.J.Wright’s remaining 72 stores, two distribution centers and home office. We continue to serve the customer demographic previously
targeted by A.J. Wright through our other U.S. banners.

Segment Overview.We operate four main business
segments: Marmaxx, HomeGoods, TJX Canada and TJX Europe. Marmaxx operates our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains in the United States. HomeGoods operates our HomeGoods chain in the U.S. TJX Canada operates our Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls chains in
Canada. TJX Europe operates our T.K. Maxx and HomeSense chains in Europe. A.J. Wright ceased to be a segment following its consolidation. Sierra Trading Post is reported as part of the Marmaxx segment. Each of our segments has its own management,
administrative, buying and merchandising organization and distribution network. More detailed information about our segments, including financial information for each of the last three fiscal years, can be found in Note G to the consolidated
financial statements.
