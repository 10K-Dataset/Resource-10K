ITEM 1. Business

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide. Our over 3,600
stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.

Our stores are known for our value proposition of brand, fashion, price and quality. Our opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model
differentiate us from traditional retailers. We offer a treasure hunt shopping experience and a rapid turn of inventories relative to traditional retailers. Our goal is to create a sense of excitement and urgency for our customers and encourage
frequent customer visits. We acquire merchandise in a variety of ways to support that goal. We reach a broad range of customers across many income levels and other demographic groups with our value proposition. Our strategies and operations are
synergistic across our retail chains. As a result, we are able to leverage our expertise throughout our business, sharing information, best practices, initiatives and new ideas, and to develop talent across our Company. We also leverage the
substantial buying power of our businesses in our global relationships with vendors.

Our Businesses.We
operate our business in four major segments: Marmaxx and HomeGoods, both in the U.S., TJX Canada and TJX International (formerly referred to as TJX Europe).

MARMAXX:

Our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains in the United States
(referred to together as The Marmaxx Group or Marmaxx) are collectively the largest off-price retailer in the United States with a total of 2,163 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel
(including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise. We primarily differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through
different product assortment, including an expanded assortment of fine jewelry and accessories and a designer section called The Runway at T.J. Maxx and a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering and a juniors’ department called The
Cube at Marshalls, as well as varying in-store initiatives. This differentiated shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both chains. Our e-commerce website, tjmaxx.com, was launched in 2013.

HOMEGOODS:

Our
HomeGoods chain, introduced in 1992, is the leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through its 526 stores, HomeGoods offers a broad array of home fashions, including home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall
décor, seasonal items, decorative accessories from around the world and other merchandise.

TJX CANADA:

Our TJX Canada segment operates the Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls chains in Canada. Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading off-price apparel
and home fashions retailer in Canada. The merchandise offering at its 245 stores across Canada is comparable to T.J. Maxx, with select stores offering fine jewelry and The Runway, a designer section. We opened our HomeSense chain in 2001, bringing
the home fashions off-price concept to Canada. HomeSense has 101 stores with a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to HomeGoods. We brought Marshalls to Canada in 2011 and operate 41 Marshalls stores in Canada. As with Marshalls in the U.S.,
our Canadian Marshalls stores offer an expanded footwear department and The Cube juniors’ department, differentiating them from Winners stores.






TJX INTERNATIONAL:

Our TJX International segment operates the T.K. Maxx and HomeSense chains in Europe and starting in late 2015, the Trade Secret chain in Australia. Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced off-price retail to Europe
and remains Europe’s only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 456 stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands. Through its stores and its e-commerce
website for the U.K., tkmaxx.com, T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J. Maxx. We brought the off-price home fashions concept to Europe, opening HomeSense in the U.K. in 2008. Its 39 stores in the U.K. offer a merchandise mix of home
fashions similar to that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada. We acquired Trade Secret in the fall of 2015. The merchandise offering at its 35 stores in Australia is comparable to T.J. Maxx.

In addition to our four major segments, we operate Sierra Trading Post, acquired in 2012, a leading off-price Internet retailer of brand name and
quality outdoor gear, family apparel and footwear, sporting goods and home fashions. Sierra Trading Post launched its e-commerce site, sierratradingpost.com, in 1998 and operates eight retail stores in the U.S.

Flexible Business Model.Our flexible off-price business model, including our opportunistic buying, inventory
management, logistics and store layouts, is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable, quality, brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values every day. Our buying and inventory management strategies
give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. Our merchants have more visibility into consumer,
fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need, which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure. Our selling floor space is flexible, without walls between departments and largely free of permanent
fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase. Our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick, efficient and differentiated
delivery of merchandise to our stores, with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times.

Opportunistic Buying.As an off-price retailer, our buying practices, which we refer to as opportunistic buying,
differentiate us from traditional retailers. Our overall buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded, designer and other quality merchandise in our stores
at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores. We seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end. Our buying organization, which numbers
more than 1,000 Associates in 15 buying offices in 11 countries, executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways, depending on market conditions and other factors.






Our expansive vendor universe, which is in excess of 18,000, consists primarily of manufacturers along
with retailers and other vendors, and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments
and expect this will continue as we continue to grow. We believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market. We are typically
willing to purchase less-than-full assortments of items, styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large; we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets;
we pay promptly; we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or return privileges; and we have
financial strength and an excellent credit rating.

Inventory Management.We offer our customers a rapidly changing
selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and to spur frequent customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions
at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local
preferences and demographics, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned. We make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally,
using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to
operate with low inventory levels, to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store.

Pricing.Our mission is to offer quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty
store regular retail prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons. We have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our
pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles.

Low Cost Operations.We operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers. We focus aggressively
on expenses throughout our business. Our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products, including at times promoting multiple banners together, which contributes to our advertising budget (as a
percentage of sales) remaining low compared to many traditional retailers. We design our stores to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping environment but, relative to other retailers, do not spend heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our
distribution network is designed to run cost effectively.

Customer Service/Shopping Experience.We continue
to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales. Although we offer a self-service format, we train our store Associates to provide friendly and helpful customer
service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience. We typically offer customer-friendly return policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards. We also offer TJX-branded
credit cards in the U.S. through a bank, but do not own the customer receivables.

Distribution.We operate
distribution centers encompassing approximately 14 million square feet in six countries. These centers are generally large, highly automated and built to suit our specific, off-price business model. We ship substantially all of our merchandise
to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties.






Store Growth.Expansion of our business through the addition of new stores
continues to be an important part of our growth strategy. The following table provides information on the store growth of our four major segments in the last two fiscal years, our growth estimates for fiscal 2017 and our estimates of the store

Competition.The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. We compete on the
basis of factors including brand, fashion, price, quality, selection and freshness; in-store service and shopping experience; reputation and store location. We compete with local, regional, national and international department, specialty,
off-price, discount, warehouse and outlet stores as well as other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through catalogues, on-line or other media.

Employees.At January 30, 2016, we had approximately 216,000 employees, many of whom work less than 40 hours per week.
In addition, we hire temporary employees, particularly during the peak back-to-school and holiday seasons.

Trademarks.We
have the right to use our principal trademarks and service marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners, HomeSense, T.K. Maxx, Sierra Trading Post and Trade Secret, in relevant countries. We expect our rights in these trademarks and
service marks to endure in locations where we use them for as long as we continue to do so.

Seasonality.Our business is
subject to seasonal influences. In the second half of the year, which includes the back-to-school and year-end holiday seasons, we generally realize higher levels of sales and income.
