ITEM 1. Business

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide. Our over 3,200 stores
offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.

Our stores are known for our value proposition of brand, fashion, quality and price and offer a treasure hunt shopping experience through the rapid
turn of inventories relative to traditional retailers. Our opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model also differentiate us from traditional retailers. Our goal is to create a sense of excitement and urgency for our customers and
encourage frequent customer visits. We acquire merchandise in a variety of ways to support that goal. We reach a broad range of customers across many income levels and other demographic groups with our value proposition. Our strategies and operating
platforms are synergistic across all of our retail chains. As a result, we are able to leverage our expertise throughout our business, sharing information, best practices, initiatives and new ideas, and developing talent across our Company. We also
leverage the substantial buying power of our businesses in our global relationships with vendors.

Our Businesses.We
operate our business in four major divisions: Marmaxx and HomeGoods, both in the U.S., TJX Canada and TJX Europe.

MARMAXX:

Our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains in the United States (referred to together as The Marmaxx Group or Marmaxx) are
collectively the largest off-price retailer in the United States with a total of 2,021 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home fashions
(including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise. We primarily differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through different product assortment (including an expanded
assortment of fine jewelry and accessories and a designer section called The Runway at T.J. Maxx and a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering and a juniors’ department called The Cube at Marshalls) and in-store initiatives. This
differentiated shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both chains. We launched our new e-commerce website,tjmaxx.comin 2013.

HOMEGOODS:

Our HomeGoods chain, introduced in 1992, is the
leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through its 450 stores, HomeGoods offers a broad array of home fashions, including home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories from around
the world, seasonal and other merchandise.

TJX CANADA:

Our TJX Canada division operates the Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls chains in Canada. Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading off-price apparel
and home fashions retailer in Canada. The merchandise offering at its 227 stores across Canada is comparable to T.J. Maxx, with select stores offering fine jewelry and The Runway, a designer section. We opened our HomeSense chain in 2001, bringing
the home fashions off-price concept to Canada. HomeSense has 91 stores with a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to HomeGoods. We brought Marshalls to Canada in 2011 and operate 27 Marshalls stores in Canada. Like Marshalls in the U.S., our
Canadian Marshalls stores offer an expanded footwear department and The Cube juniors’ department, differentiating them from Winners stores.






TJX EUROPE:

Our TJX Europe division operates the T.K. Maxx and HomeSense chains in Europe. Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced off-price to Europe and remains Europe’s only major brick-and-mortar off-price retailer of
apparel and home fashions. With 371 stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K., Ireland, Germany and Poland. Through its stores and its e-commerce website for the U.K., tkmaxx.com, T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and
Winners. We brought the off-price home fashions concept to Europe, opening HomeSense in the U.K. in 2008. Its 28 stores in the U.K. offer a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada.

Additionally, we operate Sierra Trading Post, acquired in 2012, a leading off-price Internet retailer of brand name outdoor gear, family
apparel and footwear, sporting goods and home fashions. Sierra Trading Post launched its e-commerce site, sierratradingpost.com, in 1998 and operates four retail stores in the U.S.

Flexible Business Model.Our flexible off-price business model, including our opportunistic buying, inventory
management, logistics and store layouts, is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable, quality, brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values. Our buying and inventory management strategies give us
flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. Our merchants have more visibility into consumer, fashion and
market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need, which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure. Our selling floor space is flexible, without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we
can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase. Our logistics and distribution operations are designed to support our buying strategies and to facilitate quick, efficient and differentiated delivery of
merchandise to our stores, with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right times.

Opportunistic Buying.As an off-price retailer, our buying practices, which we refer to as opportunistic buying,
differentiate us from traditional retailers. Our overall opportunistic buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded, designer and other quality merchandise
in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at department and specialty stores. We seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end. Our buying organization,
which numbers over 900 associates in 13 buying offices in ten countries, executes this opportunistic buying strategy in a variety of ways, depending on market conditions and other factors.

Our expansive vendor universe, which is in excess of 16,000, consists primarily of manufacturers along with retailers and other vendors, and provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise. We have
not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult






retail environments and expect this will continue as we continue to grow. We believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us
an attractive channel for many vendors in the market. We are typically willing to purchase less-than-full assortments of items, styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large; we are able to disperse merchandise across our
geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets; we pay promptly; we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments
to stores or delayed deliveries) or return privileges and we have financial strength and an excellent credit rating.

Inventory
Management.We offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a treasure hunt experience in our stores and spur customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly, regularly
offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, enable
us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned. We make pricing and markdown decisions and store
inventory replenishment determinations centrally, using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. Over the past several years, we have been investing in our
supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels, to ship more efficiently and quickly and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store.

Pricing.Our mission is to offer quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail
prices that are generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular retail prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons. We have generally been able to
react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles.

Low Cost Operations.We operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers. We focus aggressively
on expenses throughout our business. Our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual products, including at times promoting multiple banners together, which contributes to our advertising budget (as a
percentage of sales) remaining low compared to many traditional retailers. We design our stores to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping environment but, relative to other retailers, do not spend heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our
distribution network is designed to run cost effectively.

Customer Service/Shopping Experience.We are in
the process of renovating and upgrading stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales. Although we offer a self-service format, we train our store associates to provide friendly and helpful
customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience. We typically offer customer-friendly return policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards, and offer TJX-branded
credit cards in the U.S. through a bank, but do not own the customer receivables.

Distribution.We operate
distribution centers encompassing approximately 12 million square feet in five countries. These centers are large, highly automated and built to suit our specific, off-price business model. We ship substantially all of our merchandise to our
stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties. We shipped approximately 2 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2014.






Store Growth.Expansion of our business through the addition of new stores continues to
be an important part of our growth strategy. The following table provides information on the store growth of our four divisions in the last two fiscal years, our growth estimates for fiscal 2015 and our estimates of the store growth potential of
these divisions in their current geographies:

A.J. Wright Consolidation.In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed the
consolidation of A.J. Wright, our former off-price chain targeting lower middle income customers, converting 90 of the A.J. Wright stores to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods banners and closing A.J. Wright’s remaining 72 stores, two
distribution centers and home office. We continue to serve the customer demographic previously targeted by A.J. Wright through our other U.S. banners.

Segment Overview.We operate four main business segments. Marmaxx (T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and tjmaxx.com) and HomeGoods both operate in the United States. Our TJX Canada segment operates
Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls in Canada, and our TJX Europe segment operates T.K. Maxx, HomeSense and tkmaxx.com in Europe. Late in fiscal 2013 we acquired Sierra Trading Post (STP), an off-price Internet retailer in the U.S. The results of STP
are reported in our Marmaxx segment. Each of our segments has its own management, administrative, buying and merchandising organization and distribution network. More detailed information about our segments, including financial information for each
of the last three fiscal years, can be found in Note H to the consolidated financial statements.

Competition.The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly competitive. We
compete on the basis of factors including merchandise fashion, quality, brand name, price, selection and freshness; in-store service and shopping experience; reputation and store location. We compete with local, regional, national and international
department, specialty, off-price, discount, warehouse and outlet stores as well as other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through catalogues, on-line or other media.

Trademarks.We have the right to use our principal trademarks and service marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls,
