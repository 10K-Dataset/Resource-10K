ITEM 1. Business

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leadingoff-priceapparel and home fashions retailer in the United
States and worldwide. We have over 4,000 stores that offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty,
and major online retailers) regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day.

Our stores are known for our value proposition of
brand, fashion, price and quality. Our opportunistic buying strategies and flexible business model differentiate us from traditional retailers. We offer a treasure hunt shopping experience and a rapid turn of inventories relative to traditional
retailers. Our goal is to create a sense of excitement and urgency for our customers and encourage frequent customer visits. We acquire merchandise in a variety of ways to support that goal. We reach a broad range of customers across many income
levels and across other demographic groups with our value proposition. Our strategies and operations are synergistic across our retail chains. As a result, we are able to leverage our expertise throughout our business, sharing information, best
practices, initiatives and new ideas, and to develop talent across our Company. We also leverage the substantial buying power of our businesses in our global relationships with vendors.

Our Businesses.We operate our business in four main segments: Marmaxx and HomeGoods, both in the U.S., TJX
Canada and TJX International.

MARMAXX:

Our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls chains in the United States (“Marmaxx”) are collectively the largestoff-priceretailer in the United States with a total of 2,285
stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories
and giftware) and other merchandise. We primarily differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through different product assortment, including an expanded assortment of fine jewelry and accessories and a designer section called The Runway at T.J. Maxx and
a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering and a juniors’ department called The Cube at Marshalls, as well as varyingin-storeinitiatives. This differentiated shopping experience at T.J. Maxx
and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both chains. Oure-commercewebsite,tjmaxx.com, was launched in 2013.

HOMEGOODS:

Our HomeGoods segment, introduced in 1992, is the leadingoff-priceretailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through its 667 stores, HomeGoods offers an eclectic assortment of home fashions, including furniture, rugs, lighting, soft home, decorative accessories, tabletop and
cookware as well as expanded pet, kids and gourmet food departments. In 2017, we launched Homesense in the U.S. with 4 stores. Homesense complements HomeGoods, offering a differentiated mix and expanded departments, such as large-scale furniture,
lighting and rugs, as well as new departments, such as a general store and an entertaining marketplace.

TJX CANADA:

Our TJX Canada segment operates the Winners, HomeSense and Marshalls chains in Canada. Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leadingoff-priceapparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. The merchandise offering at its 264 stores across Canada is comparable to T.J. Maxx, with select stores offering fine jewelry, and The Runway, a designer
section. We opened our HomeSense chain in 2001, bringing the home fashionsoff-priceconcept to Canada. HomeSense has 117 stores with a merchandise mix of home fashions similar






to HomeGoods in the U.S. We brought Marshalls to Canada in 2011 and operate 73 Marshalls stores in Canada. As with Marshalls in the U.S., our Canadian Marshalls stores offer an expanded footwear
department and The Cube juniors’ department, differentiating them from Winners stores.

TJX INTERNATIONAL:

Our TJX International segment operates the T.K. Maxx and Homesense chains in Europe and starting in late 2015, the T.K. Maxx chain in Australia.
Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introducedoff-priceretail to Europe and remains Europe’s only majorbrick-and-mortaroff-priceretailer of apparel and home fashions. With 540 stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Poland, Austria and the Netherlands. Through its stores and itse-commercewebsite for the U.K., tkmaxx.com, T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J. Maxx. We brought theoff-pricehome fashions concept to Europe, opening
Homesense in the U.K. in 2008. In fiscal 2018, we opened 2 Homesense stores in Ireland. Its 55 stores offer a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada. We acquired Trade Secret in Australia in
fiscal 2016 andre-brandedit under the T.K. Maxx name during fiscal 2018. The merchandise offering at its 38 stores is comparable to T.J. Maxx.

In addition to our four main segments, we operate Sierra Trading Post (“STP”), anoff-priceInternet retailer of brand name and quality outdoor gear, family apparel and footwear, sporting goods and home fashions. Sierra Trading Post launched itse-commercesite, sierratradingpost.com, in 1998 and
operates 27 retail stores in the U.S.

Flexible Business Model.Our flexibleoff-pricebusiness model, including our opportunistic buying, inventory management, logistics and flexible store layouts, is designed to deliver our customers a compelling value proposition of fashionable,
quality, brand name and designer merchandise at excellent values every day. Our buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers, and the design and
operation of our stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. Our buyers have more visibility into consumer, fashion and market trends and pricing when we buy closer to need, which can help us “buy smarter” and reduce our
markdown exposure. Our selling floor space is flexible, without walls between departments and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments to accommodate the merchandise we purchase. Our logistics and
distribution operations are designed to support our global buying strategies and to facilitate quick, efficient and differentiated delivery of merchandise to our stores, with a goal of getting the right merchandise to the right stores at the right
time.

Opportunistic Buying.As anoff-priceretailer, our buying practices, which
we refer to as opportunistic buying, differentiate us from traditional retailers. Our overall global buying strategy is to acquire merchandise on an ongoing basis that will enable us to offer a desirable and rapidly changing mix of branded, designer
and other quality merchandise in our stores at prices below regular prices for comparable merchandise at full-price retailers, including department, specialty, and major online retailers. We seek out and select merchandise from the broad range of
opportunities in the marketplace to achieve this end. Our global buying organization, which numbers more than 1,000 Associates in 16 buying offices in 12 countries, executes this opportunistic buying strategy, buying merchandise from more than 100
countries in a variety of ways, depending on market conditions and other factors.

We take advantage of opportunities to acquire
merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the production and flow of inventory in the apparel and home fashions marketplace. These opportunities include, among others, order cancellations, manufacturer overruns, closeouts
from brands, manufacturers and other retailers and special production direct from brands and factories. Our global buying strategies are intentionally flexible to allow us to react to frequently changing opportunities and trends in the market and to
adjust how and what we source as well as when we source it. Our goal is to operate with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give us the flexibility to seek out and to take advantage of these opportunities as they arise. In
contrast to traditional retailers, which tend to order most of their goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor, our merchants generally remain in the marketplace for goods throughout the year, frequently looking for
opportunities to buy merchandise. We buy much of our merchandise for the current or immediately upcoming selling season. We also buy some merchandise that is available in the market






with the intention of storing it for sale, typically in future selling seasons. We generally make these purchases, referred to as packaway, in response to opportunities in the marketplace to buy
merchandise that we believe has the right combination of brand, fashion, price and quality to supplement the product we expect to be available to purchase later for those future seasons. We also acquire some merchandise that we offer underin-housebrands or brands that are licensed to us. We develop some of this merchandise ourselves in order to supplement the depth of, or fill gaps in, our expected merchandise assortment.

Our expansive vendor universe, which is in excess of 20,000, consists primarily of manufacturers as well as retailers and other vendors, and
provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining sufficient quality merchandise for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and expect this will continue as we
continue to grow. We believe a number of factors provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise and make us an attractive channel for many vendors in the market. We are typically willing to purchase less-than-full
assortments of items, styles and sizes as well as quantities ranging from small to very large; we are able to disperse merchandise across our geographically diverse network of stores and to target specific markets; we pay promptly; we generally do
not ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or return privileges; and we have financial strength and an excellent
credit rating.

Inventory Management.We offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a
treasure hunt experience in our stores and to spur frequent customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values. Our specialized
inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and demographics, achieve
rapidin-storeinventory turnover on a vast array of products and generally sell within the period we planned. We make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations centrally,
using information provided by specialized computer systems designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. We continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of continuing to operate with low inventory levels,
to ship more efficiently and quickly, and to more precisely and effectively allocate merchandise to each store.

Pricing.Our mission is to offer quality, fashionable, brand name and designer merchandise in our stores with retail prices that are generally 20% to 60% below full-price retailers’ (including department, specialty, and major online retailers)
regular prices on comparable merchandise, every day. We do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons. We have generally been able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing gap
relative to prices offered by traditional retailers as well as our merchandise margins through various economic cycles.

Low Cost
Operations.We operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers. We focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business. Our advertising is generally focused on promoting our retail banners rather than individual
products, including at times promoting multiple banners together, which contributes to our advertising budget (as a percentage of sales) remaining low compared to many traditional retailers. We design our stores to provide a pleasant, convenient
shopping environment but, relative to other retailers, do not spend heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively.

Customer Service/Shopping Experience.We continue to renovate and upgrade our stores across our retail banners to enhance our customers’ shopping experience and help drive sales. Although we
offer a self-service format, we train our store Associates to provide friendly and helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience. We typically offer customer-friendly return policies. We accept a
variety of payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards. We also offerTJX-brandedcredit cards in the U.S. through a bank, but do not own the customer receivables.

Distribution.We operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 17.5 million square feet in six countries, including a
third-party operated distribution center in Australia. These centers are generally large,






highly automated and built to suit our specific,off-pricebusiness model. We ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through these
distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties.

Store Growth.Expansion of our
business through the addition of new stores continues to be an important part of our global growth strategy. The following table provides information on the store growth of our four major segments in the last two fiscal years, our growth estimates
