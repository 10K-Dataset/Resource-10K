ITEM 1.BUSINESS





BUSINESS
    OVERVIEW



The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel
    and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide.
    Our over 2,700 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of
    quality, brand-name and designer merchandise at prices generally
    20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices,
    every day.



Retail Concepts.We operate multiple off-price
    retail chains in the U.S., Canada and Europe which are known for
    their treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values on
    fashionable, brand-name merchandise. Our stores turn their
    inventories rapidly relative to traditional retailers to create
    a sense of urgency and excitement for our customers which
    encourages frequent customer visits. With our flexible “no
    walls” business model, we can quickly expand and contract
    merchandise categories in response to consumers’ changing
    tastes. Although our stores primarily target the middle to upper
    middle income customer, we reach a broad range of customers
    across many demographic groups and income levels with the values
    we offer. The operating platforms and strategies of all of our
    retail concepts are synergistic. As a result, we capitalize on
    our expertise and systems throughout our business, leveraging
    information, best practices, initiatives and new ideas, and
    developing talent across our concepts. We also leverage the
    substantial buying power of our businesses in our global
    relationships with vendors.



In the United States:



—T.J. MAXX and MARSHALLS: T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    (referred to together in the U.S. as Marmaxx) are the
    largest off-price retailers in the United States with a total of
    1,753 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired
    Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including
    footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics,
    accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative
    accessories and giftware) and other merchandise. We
    differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through different product
    assortment (including an expanded assortment of fine jewelry and
    accessories and a designer section called The Runway at T.J.
    Maxx and a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering
    and a juniors’ department called The Cube at Marshalls),
    in-store initiatives, marketing and store appearance. This
    differentiated shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    encourages our customers to shop both chains.—HOMEGOODS: HomeGoods, introduced in 1992, is the
    leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the
    U.S. Through 336 stores, it sells a broad array of home
    basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall
    décor, decorative accessories, children’s furniture,
    seasonal merchandise and other merchandise.



In Canada:



—WINNERS: Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading
    off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. The
    merchandise offering at its 215 stores across Canada is
    comparable to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. In 2008, Winners opened 3
    StyleSense stores, a concept that offers family footwear and
    accessories.—MARSHALLS: In March 2011, we brought the Marshalls
    chain to Canada, with six stores planned to open in Canada
    during Fiscal 2012.—HOMESENSE: HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to Canada in 2001. The chain has 82 stores
    with a merchandise mix of home fashions similar to HomeGoods.



In Europe:



—T.K. MAXX: Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced
    off-price to Europe and remains Europe’s only major
    off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 307
    stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K. and Ireland as well as
    Germany, to which it expanded in 2007, and Poland, to which it
    expanded in 2009. Through its stores and online website, T.K.
    Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls
    and Winners.—HOMESENSE: HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to the U.K. in 2008 and its 24 stores offer a
    merchandise mix of home fashions in the U.K. similar to that of
    HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada.










A.J. Wright Consolidation.In the fourth quarter
    of fiscal 2011, we announced our decision to consolidate A.J.
    Wright, an off-price retailer of family apparel and home
    fashions primarily targeting the lower middle income customer,
    by converting 90 of its stores to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or
    HomeGoods banners and by closing the remaining 72 stores, two
    distribution centers and home office. We have increasingly
    improved our ability to reach the A.J. Wright customer
    demographic through our T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores and have
    seen these stores perform well in markets with these
    demographics. Consolidating the A.J. Wright chain is expected to
    allow us to serve this customer demographic more efficiently,
    focus our financial and managerial resources on fewer, larger
    businesses with higher returns and enhance the growth prospects
    for the Company overall. For more detail on the A.J. Wright
    consolidation, see Note C to the consolidated financial
    statements.



Flexible Business Model.Our off-price business
    model is flexible, particularly for a company of our size,
    allowing us to react to market trends. Our opportunistic buying
    and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to
    adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than
    traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our
    stores and distribution centers support this flexibility. By
    maintaining a liquid inventory position, our merchants can buy
    close to need, enabling them to buy into current market trends
    and take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. Buying
    close to need gives us insight into consumer and fashion trends
    and current pricing at the time we make our purchases, helping
    us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure. Our
    selling floor space is flexible, without walls between
    departments and largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can
    easily expand and contract departments in response to customer
    demand, as well as market and fashion trends. Our distribution
    facilities are designed to accommodate our methods of receiving
    and shipping broadly ranging quantities of product to our large
    store base quickly and efficiently.



Opportunistic Buying.We are differentiated from
    traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality,
    fashionable, brand name merchandise, which permits us to buy
    into current trends and pricing. We purchase the majority of our
    apparel inventory and a significant portion of our home fashion
    inventory opportunistically. Virtually all of our opportunistic
    purchases are made at discounts from initial wholesale prices.
    Our merchant organization numbers over 700, and we operate 12
    buying offices in nine countries. In contrast to traditional
    retailers, which typically order goods far in advance of the
    time the product appears on the selling floor, our merchants are
    in the marketplace virtually every week. They buy primarily for
    the current selling season, and to a limited extent, for a
    future selling season. Buying later in the inventory cycle than
    traditional retailers and using the flexibility of our stores to
    shift in and out of categories, we are able to take advantage of
    opportunities to acquire merchandise at substantial discounts
    that regularly arise from the routine flow of inventory in the
    highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace, such as
    order cancellations, manufacturer overruns and special
    production. We operate with lean inventory levels compared to
    conventional retailers to give ourselves the flexibility to take
    advantage of these opportunities.



We buy most of our inventory directly from manufacturers, with
    some coming from retailers and other sources. A small percentage
    of the merchandise we sell is private label merchandise produced
    for us by third parties. Our expansive vendor universe, which is
    in excess of 14,000, provides us substantial and diversified
    access to merchandise. We have not historically experienced
    difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts of quality inventory
    for our business in either favorable or difficult retail
    environments and believe that we will continue to have adequate
    inventory as we continue to grow.



We believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for
    the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an
    ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise. We are typically
    willing to purchaseless-than-fullassortments of items, styles and sizes and quantities ranging
    from small to very large; we are able to disperse inventory
    across our geographically diverse network of stores; we pay
    promptly; and we generally do not ask for typical retail
    concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown
    allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to
    stores or delayed deliveries) or return privileges. Importantly,
    we provide vendors an outlet with financial strength and an
    excellent credit rating.



Inventory Management.We offer our customers a
    rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a
    “treasure hunt” experience in our stores and spur
    customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory
    in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of
    apparel and home fashions at excellent values. Our specialized
    inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems,
    coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling
    and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our
    stores to local preferences and demographics, achieve rapid
    in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of products and sell
    substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods.
    We make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory
    replenishment determinations centrally, using








information provided by specialized computer systems, designed
    to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined
    manner. We do not generally engage in promotional pricing
    activity such as sales or coupons. Over the past several years,
    we have improved our supply chain, allowing us to reduce
    inventory levels and ship more efficiently and quickly. We plan
    to continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of more
    precisely and effectively allocating the right merchandise to
    each store and delivering it quicker and more efficiently.



Pricing.Our mission is to offer retail prices in
    our stores generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty
    store regular retail prices. Through our opportunistic
    purchasing, we are generally able to react to price fluctuations
    in the wholesale market to maintain this pricing. For example,
    in a time of rising inventory prices, if conventional retailers
    increase retail prices to preserve merchandise margin, we
    typically are able to increase our retail prices
    correspondingly, while maintaining our value relative to
    conventional retailers and preserve our own merchandise margin.
    If conventional retailers do not raise prices to pass rising
    inventory costs on to consumers, we seek to buy inventory at
    prices that permit us to maintain our values relative to
    conventional retailers and sustain our merchandise margins.



Low Cost Operations.We operate with a low cost
    structure compared to many traditional retailers. We focus
    aggressively on expenses throughout our business. Although we
    have enhanced our advertising over the past several years to
    attract new customers to our stores, our advertising budget as a
    percentage of sales remains low compared to traditional
    retailers. We design our stores, generally located in community
    shopping centers, to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping
    environment but, relative to other retailers, do not spend
    heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our distribution
    network is designed to run cost effectively. We continue to
    pursue cost savings in our operations.



Customer Service.While we offer a self-service
    format, we train our store associates to provide friendly and
    helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver
    a positive shopping experience. We typically offer
    customer-friendly return policies. We accept a variety of
    payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards. In
    the U.S., we offer a co-branded TJX credit card and a private
    label credit card, both through a bank, but do not own the
    customer receivables related to either program. We are engaged
    in a store upgrade program across our banners, designed to
    enhance the customer shopping experience and drive sales.



Distribution.We operate distribution centers
    encompassing approximately 10 million square feet in four
    countries, which are large, highly automated and built to suit
    our specific, off-price business model. We ship substantially
    all of our merchandise to our stores through these distribution
    centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by
    third parties. We shipped approximately 1.8 billion units
    to our stores during fiscal 2011.



Store Growth.Expansion of our business through
    the addition of new stores is an important part of our strategy
    for TJX as a global, off-price, value Company. The following
    table provides information on the growth and potential growth of
    each of our current chains in their current geographies:

Segment Overview.As of January 29, 2011,we operated five business segments: three in the
    U.S. and one in each of Canada and Europe. Each of our
    segments has its own administrative, buying and merchandising
    organization and distribution network. Of the U.S. based
    chains, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, referred to as Marmaxx, are
    managed together and reported as a single segment and HomeGoods
    and A.J. Wright each is reported as a separate segment. As a
    result of the consolidation of A.J. Wright, it will cease to be
    a separate segment during fiscal 2012. Outside the U.S., chains
    in Canada (Winners, HomeSense and StyleSense) are under common
    management and reported as the TJX Canada segment, and chains in
    Europe (T.K. Maxx and HomeSense) are under common management and
    reported as the TJX Europe segment. More detailed information
    about our segments, including financial information for each of
    the last three fiscal years, can be found in Note H to the
    consolidated financial statements.
