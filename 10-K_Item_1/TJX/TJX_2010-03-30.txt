BUSINESS
    OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel
    and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide.
    Our over 2,700 stores offer a rapidly changing assortment of
    quality, brand-name and designer merchandise at prices generally
    20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices
    every day.

Retail Concepts.

We operate eight off-price retail
    chains in the U.S., Canada and Europe and are known for our
    treasure hunt shopping experience and excellent values on
    brand-name merchandise. We turn our inventories rapidly relative
    to traditional retailers to create a sense of urgency and
    excitement for our customers and to encourage frequent customer
    visits. Our flexible “no walls” business model allows
    us to expand and contract merchandise categories quickly in
    response to consumers’ changing tastes. The values we offer
    appeal to a broad range of customers across demographic groups
    and income levels. The operating platforms and strategies of all
    of our retail concepts are synergistic. As a result, we
    capitalize on our off-price expertise and systems throughout our
    business, leveraging best practices, initiatives and new ideas
    and developing talent across our concepts. We also leverage the
    substantial buying power of our businesses to develop our global
    relationships with vendors.

In the United States:

—

T.J. MAXX and MARSHALLS:

T.J. Maxx and Marshalls
    (together known as Marmaxx) are the largest off-price retailers
    in the United States with a total of 1,703 stores. We founded
    T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains
    sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home
    fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs,
    wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other
    merchandise, primarily targeting the middle to upper-middle
    income customer demographic. We differentiate T.J. Maxx and
    Marshalls through product assortment (including an expanded
    assortment of fine jewelry and accessories at T.J. Maxx and a
    full line of footwear and broader men’s and juniors’
    offerings at Marshalls), in-store initiatives, marketing and
    store appearance. This differentiated shopping experience at
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both
    chains.

—

HOMEGOODS:

HomeGoods, introduced in 1992, is an
    off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through 323
    stores, it sells a broad array of home basics, giftware, accent
    furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories,
    children’s furniture, seasonal merchandise and other
    fashions for the home. The HomeGoods’ target customers are
    similar to those of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.

—

A.J. WRIGHT:

Launched in 1998, A.J. Wright, like
    T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, sells off-price family apparel, home
    fashions and other merchandise. Catering to the entire family,
    key apparel categories for A.J. Wright’s 150 stores include
    basics, children’s, women’s plus sizes, juniors, young
    men’s and footwear. Different from all of our other chains,
    A.J. Wright primarily targets the moderate-income customer
    demographic.

In Canada:

—

WINNERS:

Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading
    off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. The
    merchandise offering at its 211 stores across Canada and its
    target customers are similar to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls. In
    2008, Winners began testing StyleSense, a new concept that
    offers family footwear and accessories.

—

HOMESENSE:

HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to Canada in 2001. The chain has 79 stores
    with a merchandise mix of home fashions and target customers
    similar to HomeGoods.

In Europe:

—

T.K. MAXX:

Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced
    off-price to Europe and remains Europe’s only major
    off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions. With 263
    stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K. and Ireland as



well as Germany, where it expanded in 2007, and Poland, where it
    expanded in 2009. T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix and targets
    customers similar to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls in the
    U.S. and Winners in Canada.

—

HOMESENSE:

HomeSense introduced the home fashions
    off-price concept to the U.K. in 2008 and its 14 stores offer a
    merchandise mix of home fashions in the U.K. like that of
    HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada. HomeSense
    primarily targets customers similar to those of HomeGoods in the
    U.S. and HomeSense in Canada.

Flexible Business Model.

Our off-price business
    model is flexible, particularly for a company of our size,
    allowing us to react to market trends. Our opportunistic buying
    and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to
    adjust our assortments more frequently than traditional
    retailers, and our stores and distribution centers are built and
    designed to support this flexibility. By maintaining a liquid
    inventory position, our merchants can buy close to need,
    enabling them to buy into current market trends and to take
    advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. Buying close to
    need gives us the ability to turn our inventory more rapidly and
    adjust our pricing to the current market more frequently than
    conventional retailers. Our selling floor space is flexible,
    without walls between departments and largely free of permanent
    fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments in
    response to customer demand, available merchandise and fashion
    trends. Our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate
    our methods of receiving and shipping both small and large
    quantities of product to our large store base quickly and
    efficiently.

Opportunistic Buying.

We are differentiated from
    traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality,
    brand name merchandise. We purchase the majority of our apparel
    inventory and a significant portion of our home fashion
    inventory opportunistically and purchase virtually all of our
    inventory at discounts from initial wholesale prices. Our
    merchant organization numbers over 700, and we operate 12 buying
    offices in the U.S. and abroad. We continue to open many
    new vendors each year, sourcing from a vendor universe of over
    12,000 in fiscal 2010. In contrast to traditional retailers,
    which typically order goods far in advance of the time the
    product appears on the selling floor, our merchants are in the
    marketplace virtually every week, buying primarily for the
    current selling season, and to a limited extent, for a future
    selling season.

We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate amounts
    of quality inventory for our business in either favorable or
    difficult retail environments and believe that we will continue
    to have adequate inventory as we continue to grow. Buying later
    in the inventory cycle than traditional retailers and
    maintaining flexibility in adapting to changing conditions, we
    are able to take advantage of opportunities to acquire
    merchandise at substantial discounts, such as order
    cancellations and manufacturer overruns, which regularly arise
    from the routine flow of inventory in the highly fragmented
    apparel and home fashions marketplace. As a result, we are able
    to buy the vast majority of our inventory opportunistically and
    directly from manufacturers, with some coming from retailers and
    other sources. A small percentage of the merchandise we sell is
    private label merchandise produced specifically for us by third
    party manufacturers.

We believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for
    the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an
    ongoing basis to leading branded merchandise. We are willing to
    purchase

less-than-full

assortments of items, styles and sizes, pay promptly and do not
    ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising,
    promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such
    as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or return
    privileges. We are able to purchase quantities of inventory that
    range from small to very large, and we have the ability to sell
    product through a geographically diverse network of stores.
    Importantly, in TJX, we offer vendors an outlet with financial
    strength and an excellent credit rating.

Inventory Management.

We offer our customers a
    rapidly changing selection of merchandise to create a
    “treasure hunt” experience in our stores. To achieve
    this, we seek to rapidly turn the inventory in our stores,
    regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions
    at excellent values. Our specialized inventory planning,
    purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with
    distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping
    systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to
    local preferences, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on
    a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise
    within targeted selling periods. We make pricing and markdown
    decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations
    centrally, using information provided by specialized computer



systems, designed to move inventory through our stores in a
    timely and disciplined manner. We do not generally engage in
    promotional pricing activity.

Low Cost Operations.

We operate with a low cost
    structure compared to many other traditional retailers. We focus
    aggressively on expenses throughout our business. Our
    advertising budget as a percentage of sales is low compared to
    traditional retailers. We design our stores, generally located
    in community shopping centers, to provide a pleasant, convenient
    shopping environment but do not spend heavily on store fixtures.
    Additionally, our distribution network is designed to run cost
    effectively. We continue to pursue cost saving strategies in
    areas such as non-merchandise procurement, operating
    efficiencies in our distribution centers and stores, as well as
    efficiencies in our supply chain.

Customer Service.

While we offer a self-service
    format, we train our store associates to provide friendly and
    helpful customer service. We also have customer-friendly return
    policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash,
    credit cards and debit cards. In the U.S., we offer a co-branded
    TJX credit card and a private label credit card, both through a
    major bank, but do not maintain customer credit receivables
    related to either program.

Distribution.

We operate 13 distribution centers
    in the U.S., 2 in Canada and 4 in the U.K. Our distribution
    centers encompass approximately 11 million square feet. We
    ship substantially all of our merchandise to our stores through
    these distribution centers, which are large, highly automated
    and built to suit our specific, off-price business model, as
    well as warehouses operated by third parties. We shipped
    approximately 1.6 billion units to our stores during fiscal
    2010.

Store Growth.

Expansion of our business through
    the addition of new stores is an important part of our strategy
    for TJX as a global, off-price, value company. The following
    table provides information on the growth and potential growth of
    each of our chains:

Segment Overview.

We operate five business
    segments: three in the U.S. and one in each of Canada and
    Europe. Each of our segments has its own administrative, buying
    and merchandising organization and distribution network. Of our

U.S.-based

stores, T.J. Maxx and Marshalls, referred to as Marmaxx, are
    managed together and reported as a single segment, and A.J.
    Wright and HomeGoods each is reported as a separate segment.
    Outside the U.S., our chains in Canada are managed together, and
    our chains in Europe are managed together. Thus, Canada is
    reported as a segment and Europe is reported as a segment. More
    detailed information about our segments, including financial
    information for each of the last three fiscal years, can be
    found in Note Q to the consolidated financial statements.

Competition.

The retail apparel and home fashion business is highly
    competitive. We compete on the basis of fashion, quality, price,
    value, merchandise selection and freshness, brand name
    recognition, service, reputation and store location. We compete
    with local, regional, national and international department,
    specialty, off-price, discount, warehouse and outlet stores as
    well as other retailers that sell apparel, home fashions and
    other merchandise that we sell, whether in stores, through
    catalogues or media or over the internet.

Employees.

At January 30, 2010, we had approximately
    154,000 employees, many of whom work less than
    40 hours per week. In addition, we hire temporary employees
    during the peak

back-to-school

and holiday seasons.

Trademarks.

We have the right to use our principal trademarks and service
    marks, which are T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods, Winners,
    HomeSense, T.K. Maxx and A.J. Wright, in relevant countries. Our
    rights in these trademarks and service marks endure for as long
    as they are used.

Seasonality.

Our business is subject to seasonal influences. In the second
    half of the year, which includes the

back-to-school

and holiday seasons, we generally realize higher levels of sales
    and income.

Sale of
    Bob’s Stores.

In fiscal 2009, we sold Bob’s Stores, a value-oriented,
    branded apparel chain we acquired in fiscal 2004. The loss on
    the sale and historical results of operations have been
    accounted for as discontinued operations.
