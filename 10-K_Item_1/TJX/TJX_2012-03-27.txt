ITEM 1. BUSINESS

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The TJX Companies, Inc. (TJX) is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the United States and worldwide. Our over 2,900 stores
offer a rapidly changing assortment of quality, fashionable, brand-name and designer merchandise at prices generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular prices, every day.

Retail Concept.We operate apparel and home fashions off-price retail chains which are known for their treasure hunt shopping
experience and excellent values on fashionable, brand-name merchandise within four major divisions: the Marmaxx Group (or Marmaxx) and HomeGoods in the U.S., TJX Canada and TJX Europe. Inventories turn rapidly in our stores relative to traditional
retailers to create a sense of urgency and excitement for our customers which encourages frequent customer visits. With our flexible “no walls” business model, we can quickly expand and contract merchandise categories in response to
consumers’ changing tastes and market conditions. Although our stores primarily target the middle to upper middle income customer, we reach a broad range of customers across many demographic groups and income levels with the values we offer.
The operating platforms and strategies of all of our retail concepts are synergistic. As a result, we capitalize on our expertise and systems throughout our business, leveraging information, best practices, initiatives and new ideas, and developing
talent across our concepts. We also leverage the substantial buying power of our businesses in our global relationships with vendors.

In the United States:



—T.J. MAXX and MARSHALLS(MARMAXX): T.J. Maxx and Marshalls (referred to together in the U.S. as Marmaxx) are collectively the largest
off-price retailer in the United States with a total of 1,867 stores. We founded T.J. Maxx in 1976 and acquired Marshalls in 1995. Both chains sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent
furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise. We differentiate T.J. Maxx and Marshalls through different product assortment (including an expanded assortment of fine jewelry and accessories
and a designer section called The Runway at T.J. Maxx and a full line of footwear, a broader men’s offering and a juniors’ department called The Cube at Marshalls), in-store initiatives, marketing and store appearance. This differentiated
shopping experience at T.J. Maxx and Marshalls encourages our customers to shop both chains.



—HOMEGOODS: HomeGoods, introduced in 1992, is the leading off-price retailer of home fashions in the U.S. Through its 374 stores, the chain offers a
broad array of home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories, children’s furniture, seasonal and other merchandise.

TJX Canada:



—WINNERS: Acquired in 1990, Winners is the leading off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in Canada. The merchandise offering at its 216
stores across Canada is comparable to T.J. Maxx and Marshalls.



—MARSHALLS: In March 2011, we brought the Marshalls chain to Canada, and successfully opened a total of six Canadian Marshalls stores during fiscal
2012. Like Marshalls in the U.S., our Canadian Marshalls stores offer an expanded footwear department and a juniors’ department called The Cube, differentiating it from the Winners chain.



—HOMESENSE: HomeSense introduced the home fashions off-price concept to Canada in 2001. The chain has 86 stores with a merchandise mix of home
fashions similar to HomeGoods.






TJX Europe:



—T.K. MAXX: Launched in 1994, T.K. Maxx introduced off-price to Europe and remains Europe’s only major off-price retailer of apparel and home
fashions. With 332 stores, T.K. Maxx operates in the U.K. and Ireland as well as Germany, to which it expanded in 2007, and Poland, to which it expanded in 2009. Through its stores and online website, T.K. Maxx offers a merchandise mix similar to
T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and Winners.



—HOMESENSE: HomeSense brought the home fashions off-price concept to Europe, opening in the U.K. in 2008. Its 24 stores offer a merchandise mix of
home fashions in the U.K. similar to that of HomeGoods in the U.S. and HomeSense in Canada.

A.J. Wright
Consolidation.In the first quarter of fiscal 2012, we completed the consolidation of A.J. Wright, converting 90 of the A.J. Wright stores to T.J. Maxx, Marshalls or HomeGoods banners and closing the remaining 72 stores, two distribution
centers and home office. We continue to serve the customer demographic previously targeted by A.J. Wright through our other banners.

Flexible Business Model.Our off-price business model is flexible, particularly for a company of our size, allowing us to react to
market trends. Our opportunistic buying and inventory management strategies give us flexibility to adjust our merchandise assortments more frequently than traditional retailers, and the design and operation of our stores and distribution centers
support this flexibility. By maintaining a liquid inventory position, our merchants can buy close to need, enabling them to buy into current market trends and take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace. Buying close to need gives us
visibility into consumer and fashion trends and current pricing at the time we make our purchases, helping us “buy smarter” and reduce our markdown exposure. Our selling floor space is flexible, without walls between departments and
largely free of permanent fixtures, so we can easily expand and contract departments in response to customer demand, as well as market and fashion trends. Our distribution facilities are designed to accommodate our methods of receiving and shipping
broadly ranging quantities of product to our large store base quickly and efficiently.

Opportunistic Buying.We are
differentiated from traditional retailers by our opportunistic buying of quality, fashionable, brand name merchandise, which permits us to buy into current trends and pricing. We purchase the majority of our apparel inventory and a significant
portion of our home fashion inventory opportunistically. Virtually all of our opportunistic purchases are made at discounts from initial wholesale prices. Our buying organization numbers over 700, and we operate 12 buying offices in nine countries.
In contrast to traditional retailers, which typically order goods far in advance of the time the product appears on the selling floor, our merchants are in the marketplace virtually every week. They buy primarily for the current selling season, and
to a limited extent, for a future selling season. Buying later in the inventory cycle than traditional retailers and using the flexibility of our stores to shift in and out of categories, we are able to take advantage of opportunities to acquire
merchandise at substantial discounts that regularly arise from the routine flow of inventory in the highly fragmented apparel and home fashions marketplace, such as order cancellations, manufacturer overruns and special production. We operate
with lean inventory levels compared to conventional retailers to give ourselves the flexibility to take advantage of these opportunities.

We buy most of our inventory directly from manufacturers, with some coming from retailers and other sources. A small percentage of the merchandise
we sell is private label merchandise produced for us by third parties. Our expansive vendor universe, which is in excess of 15,000, provides us substantial and diversified access to merchandise. We have not historically experienced difficulty in
obtaining adequate amounts of quality inventory for our business in either favorable or difficult retail environments and believe that we will continue to have adequate inventory as we continue to grow.

We believe a number of factors make us an attractive outlet for the vendor community and provide us excellent access on an ongoing basis to leading
branded merchandise. We are typically willing to purchase less-than-full assortments of items, styles and sizes and quantities ranging from small to very large; we are able to disperse inventory across our geographically diverse network of stores or
to specific markets; we pay promptly; and we generally do not ask for typical retail concessions (such as advertising, promotional and markdown allowances), delivery concessions (such as drop shipments to stores or delayed deliveries) or return
privileges. Importantly, we provide vendors an outlet with financial strength and an excellent credit rating.






Inventory Management.We offer our customers a rapidly changing selection of merchandise
to create a “treasure hunt” experience in our stores and spur customer visits. To achieve this, we seek to turn the inventory in our stores rapidly, regularly offering fresh selections of apparel and home fashions at excellent values. Our
specialized inventory planning, purchasing, monitoring and markdown systems, coupled with distribution center storage, processing, handling and shipping systems, enable us to tailor the merchandise in our stores to local preferences and
demographics, achieve rapid in-store inventory turnover on a vast array of products and sell substantially all merchandise within targeted selling periods. We make pricing and markdown decisions and store inventory replenishment determinations
centrally, using information provided by specialized computer systems, designed to move inventory through our stores in a timely and disciplined manner. We do not generally engage in promotional pricing activity such as sales or coupons. Over the
past several years, we have improved our supply chain, allowing us to reduce inventory levels and ship more efficiently and quickly. We plan to continue to invest in our supply chain with the goal of more precisely and effectively allocating the
right merchandise to each store and delivering it even more quickly and efficiently.

Pricing.Our mission is to offer
retail prices in our stores generally 20% to 60% below department and specialty store regular retail prices. Through our opportunistic purchasing, we are generally able to react to price fluctuations in the wholesale market to maintain our pricing
gap relative to prices offered by other retailers. For example, in a time of rising inventory prices, if conventional retailers increase retail prices to preserve merchandise margin, we typically are able to increase our retail prices
correspondingly, while maintaining our value relative to conventional retailers and preserve our own merchandise margin. If conventional retailers do not raise prices to pass rising inventory costs on to consumers, we seek to buy inventory at prices
that permit us to maintain our values relative to conventional retailers and sustain our merchandise margins.

Low Cost
Operations.We operate with a low cost structure compared to many traditional retailers. We focus aggressively on expenses throughout our business. Our advertising is focused on our banners rather than individual products, and partially as a
result, our advertising budget as a percentage of sales remains low compared to traditional retailers. We design our stores, generally located in community shopping centers, to provide a pleasant, convenient shopping environment but, relative to
other retailers, do not spend heavily on store fixtures. Additionally, our distribution network is designed to run cost effectively. We continue to pursue cost savings in our operations.

Customer Service/Shopping Experience.While we offer a self-service format, we train our store associates to provide friendly and
helpful customer service and seek to staff our stores to deliver a positive shopping experience. We typically offer customer-friendly return policies. We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, credit cards and debit cards. In the U.S.,
we offer a co-branded TJX credit card and a private label credit card, both through a bank, but do not own the customer receivables related to either program. We plan to continue our program of renovating and upgrading stores across our banners,
which we believe has enhanced our customers’ shopping experience and has helped to drive sales.

Distribution.We
operate distribution centers encompassing approximately 11 million square feet in four countries. These centers are large, highly automated and built to suit our specific, off-price business model. We ship substantially all of our merchandise
to our stores through these distribution centers as well as warehouses and shipping centers operated by third parties. We shipped approximately 1.8 billion units to our stores during fiscal 2012.






Store Growth.Expansion of our business through the addition of new stores is an
important part of our strategy for TJX as a global, off-price, value company. The following table provides information on the growth and potential growth of each of our current chains in their current geographies:

organization and distribution network. The A.J. Wright chain was also reported as a separate segment through the first quarter of fiscal 2012, when the consolidation of A.J. Wright was completed. More detailed information about our segments,
