Technology and Architecture



Our proprietary FortiASIC hardware architecture, FortiOS operating system and associated security and networking functions combine to form a platform that integrates security features and enables our products to perform sophisticated security processing for networks with high throughput requirements.



FortiASIC



Our FortiASIC family of Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (“ASICs”), is comprised of three lines of processors: FortiASIC content processor (“CP”), the FortiASIC network processor (“NP”), and the FortiASIC system-on-a-chip (“SOC”).









These custom ASICs are designed to enhance the sophisticated security processing capabilities implemented in software by accelerating the computation-intensive tasks such as firewall policy enforcement or IPS anomaly detection. This architecture provides the flexibility of implementing accelerated processing of new threat detection without requiring a new ASIC release. The FortiASIC CP is currently included in most of our entry-level and all of our mid-range and high-end FortiGate appliances. The FortiASIC NP is currently included in some of our mid-range and high-end FortiGate appliances, delivering further accelerated firewall and VPN performance. The FortiASIC SOC is currently included in our entry-level FortiGate-20 and -40 product families.During fiscal 2012, we also introduced our new FortiASIC-SoC2 processor,which is currently being designed into our new appliances. FortiASIC-SoC2 is our second-generation processor that combines general purpose processing power with Fortinet’s custom technology to provide hardware-accelerated network security performance for our FortiGate appliances. It provides more than double the general processing capacity than its predecessor.



FortiOS



Our FortiOS operating system provides the foundation for the operation of all FortiGate appliances, from the core kernel functions to the security processing feature sets. FortiOS provides multiple layers of security including a hardened kernel layer providing protection for the FortiGate system, a network security layer providing security for end-customers’ network infrastructures, and application content protection providing security for end-customers’ workstations and applications. FortiOS directs the operations of processors and ASICs as well as providing system management functions such as command-line and graphical user interfaces.



In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we released the latest version of our FortiOS operating system, which brings advanced security, control, and intelligence that organizations of all sizes need to protect themselves from today’s sophisticated threats. These enhancements to FortiOS include:



•A client reputation feature which delivers specific, actionable information that identifies compromised systems in real time.



•On-device behavior-based heuristic engine and cloud-based anti-malware services.



•Industry-validated anti-malware protection.



•User-based and device-based access and security policy enforcement for mobile devices.



•Automatic adjustment of role-based policies for users and guests based on location, data, and application profiles.



We make available updates to FortiOS through our FortiCare support services. FortiOS also enables advanced, integrated routing and switching, allowing end-customers to deploy FortiGate devices within a wide variety of networks, as well as providing a direct replacement solution option for legacy switching and routing equipment. FortiOS implements a suite of commonly used routing protocols as well as address translation technologies, allowing the FortiGate appliance to integrate and operate in a wide variety of network environments. Additional features include Virtual Domain (“VDOM”), capabilities and traffic queuing and shaping, enabling administrators to set the appropriate configurations and policies that meet their infrastructure needs. FortiOS also provides capabilities for logging of traffic for forensic analysis purposes which are particularly important for regulatory compliance initiatives like PCI DSS. FortiOS’s packet classification, queue disciplines, policy enforcement, congestion management, and other traffic optimization functionality are designed to help control network traffic in order to optimize performance.



Our FortiOS incorporates the following eight core security and networking technologies:



•Firewall. Our firewall technology delivers high performance network and application firewalling, including the ability to enforce policies based on application behavior and content. Our technology identifies traffic patterns independent of port or protocol used, and links them to the use of specific applications, enabling visibility and control over application behavior (explained in more detail below). By coupling application intelligence with firewall technology, the FortiGate platform is able to deliver real-time security with integrated application content level inspection, thereby simplifying security deployments.



•Virtual Private Network. Our advanced VPN technology provides secure communications between multiple networks and hosts, through both secure socket layer (“SSL”), and IPsec VPN technologies, leveraging our custom FortiASIC to provide hardware acceleration for high-performance communications and data privacy.











•Application Control.Our application control technology allows our end-customers to define granular network-based application policies in over 2,400 applications, providing additional visibility and control over application access, user behavior within applications, and application content.



•Anti-malware. Our anti-malware technology provides protection against malware, including viruses, spyware and trojans.



•Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). Our IPS technology provides protection against current and emerging network level threats.



•Web Filtering. Our Web filtering automation technology works in concert with our research team to collect, analyze and categorize websites to provide real-time protection through website ratings and categorization. Our Web filtering technology is a pro-active defense feature that identifies known locations of malware and blocks access to these malicious sources.



•Anti-spam. We employ a variety of anti-spam techniques to detect and block spam. These techniques include a hosted service performing algorithmic validations of messages against known spam messages, sophisticated reputation service designed to evaluate and track valid email sources and destinations, intelligent image scanning to evaluate the validity of images and dynamic heuristic rules to allow messages to be evaluated based on content within each message.



•WAN Acceleration. Our storage-enabled and storage-ready FortiGate appliances provide the ability to accelerate network traffic across the wide area network by implementing a combination of application content caching and protocol optimization techniques.



In addition to the eight core security and networking functions mentioned above, we also incorporate additional technologies within FortiGate appliances that differentiate our UTM/NGFW solution, including:



•Data Leakage Prevention (DLP).Our DLP technology provides the ability to define rules based on corporate policies, and consequently detect and help prevent confidential data from being distributed outside of the corporate network.



•Traffic optimization.Our traffic optimization technology combines quality of service techniques with traffic shaping to provide better service to selected network traffic based on customer policies without causing interruptions to other traffic.



•SSL inspection.Our SSL inspection technology provides the ability to decrypt SSL application content for processing by FortiOS. The ability to inspect encrypted SSL content enables our customers to ensure protection from malware that would be otherwise hidden from traditional security products, and enforce the full complement of security and networking features available within FortiOS.



•Vulnerability Management. Our vulnerability management technology enables the FortiGate platform to perform network scans to discover systems on a network, identity vulnerabilities and recommend steps for remediation. The FortiGate devices can store the results of the scans locally, or send the results from multiple FortiGate devices to a central FortiAnalyzer for aggregation and analysis.



•Wireless Controller. Our wireless controller technology provides the ability to deploy FortiAP wireless access points to create a secure wireless network. FortiAP access points tunnel all wireless traffic to FortiGate or FortiWiFi platforms, enabling end-customers to use a single security platform to manage all wired and wireless network traffic.



Products



Our core product offerings consist of our FortiGate UTM/NGFW product family, along with our FortiManager central management and FortiAnalyzer central logging and reporting product families, both of which are typically purchased to complement a large FortiGate deployment.













FortiGate



Our flagship FortiGate physical and virtual appliances offer a broad set of security and networking functions, including firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, Web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. All FortiGate models are based on our proprietary operating system, FortiOS, and substantially all FortiGate physical appliances include our proprietary FortiASICs to accelerate content and network security features implemented within FortiOS. FortiGate platforms can be centrally managed through both embedded Web-based and command line interfaces, as well as through FortiManager which provides a central management architecture for thousands of FortiGate physical and virtual appliances.



By combining multiple network security functions in our purpose-built security platform, the FortiGate provides high quality protection capabilities and deployment flexibility while reducing the operational burden and costs associated with managing multiple point products. Through FortiGuard security subscription services, our products enable end-customers to add security functionality as required by their evolving business needs and the changing threat landscape. By purchasing FortiGuard security subscription services, end-customers obtain coverage and access to regular updates for application control, antivirus, IPS, Web filtering and anti-spam functions for their FortiGate appliances. With over 30 models in the FortiGate product line, FortiGate is designed to address security requirements for small- to mid-sized businesses, remote offices, large enterprises, and service providers.



Each FortiGate model runs our FortiOS operating system, and substantially all FortiGate physical appliances include our FortiASIC CP. The significant differences between each model are the performance and scalability targets each model is designed to meet, while the security features and associated services offered are common throughout all models.

FortiGate System Virtualization (VDOM)



In addition to providing network and content level security, our FortiOS operating system also offers system virtualization capabilities—the ability to “divide” a security appliance into multiple, separately provisioned and managed instances. This capability is currently deployed in substantially all of our FortiGate products as our virtual domain, or VDOM, feature, where administrators have the ability to segment a single FortiGate appliance platform into multiple FortiGate instances. Network









security system virtualization, using our VDOM feature, provides isolation between each virtual system, giving administrators flexibility in configuration and traffic management capabilities for each virtual instance.

As ofDecember 31, 2012, our research and development organization had headcount of599people predominantly in Canada, the United States and China. Our research and development expense was$81.1 millionin fiscal 2012,$63.6 millionin fiscal 2011 and$49.8 millionin fiscal 2010.



Intellectual Property



We rely primarily on patent, trademark, copyright and trade secrets laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our technology. As ofDecember 31, 2012, we had 102 issued U.S. patents, 18 issued Chinese patents, 1 issued Japanese patent, 86 patent applications pending for examination in the United States, and 9 patent applications pending for examination in China. We also license software from third parties for inclusion in our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.



Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, vendors and customers, and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. However, we cannot assure you that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of our technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States, and many foreign countries do not enforce these laws as diligently as government agencies and private parties in the United States.



Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners or our end-customers. Successful claims of infringement by a third party could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services or require us to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents or copyrights), royalties or other fees. Even if third parties may offer a license to their technology, the terms of any offered license may not be acceptable and the failure to obtain a license or the costs associated with any license could cause our business, operating results or financial condition to be materially and adversely affected. We typically indemnify our end-customers, distributors and certain resellers against claims that our products infringe the intellectual property of third parties.



Seasonality



For information regarding seasonality, see the section entitled “—Quarterly Results of Operations—Seasonality, Cyclicality and Quarterly Revenue Trends” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

















Competition



The markets for our products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change. The principal competitive factors in our markets include the following:



•product performance, features, effectiveness, interoperability and reliability;



•technological expertise;



•price of products and services and total cost of ownership;



•brand recognition;



•customer service and support;



•sales and distribution capabilities;



•compliance with industry standards and certifications;



•size and financial stability of operations; and



•breadth of product line.



Our competitors include networking companies such as Cisco Systems, Inc. (“Cisco”) and Juniper Networks, Inc. (“Juniper”), security vendors such as Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (“Check Point”), McAfee, Inc. (“McAfee”) (acquired by Intel), SonicWALL, Inc. (“SonicWALL”) (acquired by Dell Inc. (“Dell”)), and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. (“Palo Alto Networks”), and other point solution security vendors.



We believe we compete favorably based on our products’ performance, reliability and breadth, our ability to add and integrate new networking and security features and our technological expertise. Several competitors are significantly larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition. Some of these larger competitors have substantially broader product offerings and leverage their relationships based on other products or incorporate functionality into existing products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products. Based in part on these competitive pressures, we may lower prices or attempt to add incremental features and functionality.



Conditions in our markets could change rapidly and significantly as a result of technological advancements or continuing market consolidation. The development and market acceptance of alternative technologies could decrease the demand for our products or render them obsolete. Our competitors may introduce products that are less costly, provide superior performance or achieve greater market acceptance than our products. In addition, our larger competitors often have broader product lines and market focus, are in a better position to withstand any significant reduction in capital spending by end-customers in these markets, and will therefore not be as susceptible to downturns in a particular market. The above competitive pressures are likely to continue to impact our business. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future, and competition may harm our business.
