Competition

Competition in the major home appliance industry is intense, including competitors such as Arcelik, Bosch Siemens, Electrolux, General Electric, Haier, Kenmore, LG, Mabe, Midea, Panasonic and Samsung, many of which are increasingly expanding beyond their existing manufacturing footprint. Moreover, our customer base includes large, sophisticated trade customers who have many choices and demand competitive products, services and prices. Competition in our business is based upon a wide variety of factors, including selling price, product features and design, performance, innovation, energy efficiency, quality, cost, distribution and financial incentives. These financial incentives include cooperative advertising, co-marketing funds, salesperson incentives, volume rebates and terms. We believe that we can best compete in the current environment by focusing on introducing new and innovative products, building strong brands, enhancing trade customer and consumer value with our product offerings, continuing to expand our regional footprint, expanding trade distribution channels, increasing productivity, improving quality, lowering costs, and taking other efficiency-enhancing measures.

Raw Materials and Purchased Components

We are generally not dependent upon any one source for raw materials or purchased components essential to our business. In areas where a single supplier is used, alternative sources are generally available and can be developed within the normal manufacturing environment. Some supply disruptions and unanticipated costs may be incurred in transitioning to a new supplier if a prior single supplier relationship were abruptly interrupted or terminated. Supply constraints due to environmental impacts such as hurricanes and floods have required the qualification and use of alternate materials, some of which were at premium costs. We believe such raw materials and components will be available in adequate quantities to meet forecasted production schedules.

Trademarks, Licenses and Patents

We consider the trademarks, licenses and patents we own, in the aggregate, to be a valuable asset. Whirlpool is the owner of a number of trademarks in the United States and foreign countries. The most important trademarks to North America areWhirlpool,Maytag,Jenn-Air,KitchenAid,AmanaandAcros. The most important trademarks to Latin America areConsul,Brastemp,WhirlpoolandKitchenAid. The most important trademarks to EMEA areWhirlpool,KitchenAid, Bauknecht, Indesit, Hotpoint(Whirlpool ownership of theHotpointbrand in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions is not affiliated with theHotpointbrand sold in the Americas), Hotpoint-AristonandIgnis. The most important trademarks to Asia areWhirlpool, Royalstar and Diqua. We receive royalties from licensing our trademarks to third parties to manufacture, sell and service certain products bearing theWhirlpool, Maytag, KitchenAid,andAmanabrand names. We continually apply for and obtain United States and foreign patents. The primary purpose in obtaining patents is to protect our designs and technologies.

Research and Development

Expenditures for research and development relating to new and innovative products and the improvement of existing products were approximately $579 million,$563 millionand$582 millionin2015,2014and2013, respectively.

Protection of the Environment

Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect or enhance the environment, many of which require federal, state, or other governmental licenses and permits with regard to wastewater discharges, air emissions, and hazardous waste management. Our policy is to comply with all such laws and regulations. Where laws and regulations are less restrictive, we have established and are following our own standards, consistent with our commitment to environmental responsibility.

We believe that we are in compliance, in all material respects, with presently applicable governmental provisions relating to environmental protection in the countries in which we have manufacturing operations. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had a material effect on capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position during2015and is not expected to be material in2016.










The entire major home appliance industry, including Whirlpool, must contend with the adoption of stricter governmental energy and environmental standards. These standards were phased-in over the past several years and include the general phase-out of ozone-depleting chemicals used in refrigeration, energy standards rulemakings for selected major appliances, regulatory restrictions on the materials content specified for use in our products by some jurisdictions and mandated recycling of our products at the end of their useful lives. Compliance with these various standards, as they become effective, will require some product redesign. However, we believe, based on our understanding of the current state of proposed regulations, that we will be able to develop, manufacture, and market products that comply with these regulations.

Whirlpool participates in environmental assessments and cleanup at a number of locations globally.  These include operating and non-operating facilities, previously owned properties and waste sites, including "Superfund" (Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA)) sites. However, based upon our evaluation of the facts and circumstances relating to these sites along with the evaluation of our technical consultants, we do not presently anticipate any material adverse effect upon our earnings, financial condition, or competitive position arising out of the resolution of these matters or the resolution of any other known governmental proceeding regarding environmental protection matters.

Whirlpool ChinaAcquisition

OnOctober 24, 2014, Whirlpool's wholly-owned subsidiary, Whirlpool (China) Investment Co., Ltd., completed its acquisition of a51%equity stake in Hefei Rongshida Sanyo Electric Co., Ltd. ("Hefei Sanyo"), a joint stock company whose shares are listed and traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, which we have since renamed to Whirlpool (China) Co., Ltd. ("Whirlpool China").

The aggregate purchase price was RMB3.4 billion(approximately$551 millionat the dates of purchase of each step of the transaction). The Company funded the total consideration for the shares with cash on hand. The cash paid for the private placement step is considered restricted cash, which isused to fund capital and technical resources to enhance Whirlpool China’s research and development and working capital.

With this acquisition, Whirlpool also gains manufacturing scale and a competitive cost structure. Further discussion of this transaction can be found in Note2of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

IndesitCompany S.p.A. Acquisition

OnDecember 3, 2014, Whirlpool completed the final step in its acquisition of Indesit Company S.p.A. ("Indesit") and on the same day Indesit delisted from the Electronic Stock Market organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. Total consideration paid for Indesit was€1.1 billion(approximately$1.4 billionat the dates of purchase of each step in the transaction) in aggregate net of cash acquired.

The Company funded the aggregate purchase price for Indesit through borrowings under its credit facility and commercial paper programs, and repaid a portion of such borrowings through the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of$650 millionin senior notes onNovember 4, 2014and an aggregate principal amount of€500 million(approximately$525 millionas of the date of issuance) in senior notes onMarch 12, 2015.  Additional information about our 2015 financing arrangements can be found in Note6.

This transaction builds Whirlpool’s market position within Europe, and we believe will enable sustainable growth given the complementary market positions, product offerings and distribution channels of Whirlpool andIndesitthroughout Europe. Further discussion of this transaction can be found in Note2of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
