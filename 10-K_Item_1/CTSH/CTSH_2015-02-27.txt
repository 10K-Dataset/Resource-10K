Item 1.Business

Overview

We are a leading provider of information technology (IT), consulting and business process services, dedicated to helping the world’s leading companies innovate and build stronger businesses. Our clients engage us to help them operate more efficiently, provide solutions for critical business and technology problems, and to help them drive technology-based innovation and growth. Our core competencies include: Business, Process, Operations and IT Consulting, Application Development and Systems Integration, Enterprise Information Management, or EIM, Application Testing, Application Maintenance, IT Infrastructure Services, or IT IS, and Business Process Services, or BPS. We tailor our services to specific industries and utilize an integrated global delivery model. This seamless global sourcing model combines industry-specific expertise, client service teams based on-site at the client locations and delivery teams located at dedicated near-shore and offshore global delivery centers.

We completed several acquisitions during 2014 that we believe will accelerate our ability to provide multi-service integrated solutions to the healthcare industry and enhance our overall digital delivery capabilities. We believe that our fourth quarter acquisition of TZ US Parent, Inc., or TriZetto, a leading provider of healthcare IT software and solutions, broadens our solutions offerings and creates an opportunity for us to cross-sell our business process, infrastructure management and consulting services to the TriZetto clients where we currently do not have relationships. More importantly, we believe a greater longer term opportunity exists for us to combine TriZetto’s platforms with our services and program management capabilities to create end-to-end integrated platform-based solutions that bring together infrastructure, applications, the cloud and business process services. During 2014, we completed three other acquisitions to strengthen our digital delivery capabilities across several industry groups.

Industry Background

In today’s complex business environment, many companies face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics, driven by such factors as changes in the economy, government regulations, globalization, virtualization and other technology innovations. At the same time, companies must evaluate the effect of emerging digital technologies, including social networks, mobile devices, advanced analytics and cloud computing, or SMAC, on their business operations. These technologies represent a new IT infrastructure that will transform the way companies relate to their customers, engage with employees, and bring innovative products and services to market. In response to these challenges, many companies are focused on improving efficiencies and enhancing effectiveness while also driving innovation through technology to favorably impact both the bottom-line and the top-line. Companies need to build agility into both the cost and revenue sides of their models. In this context, they increasingly view a global sourcing model as a key to their efforts to operate more cost-effectively and productively. At the same time, companies are confronting secular industry shifts, changing customer requirements and new technologies that require them to innovate by building new and different capabilities with emerging technologies to ensure their businesses stay competitive.

Companies increasingly seek to meet a dual mandate of achieving more efficient and effective operations, including cost reductions, while developing technology-based innovation and business transformation in a comprehensive, integrated manner. Achieving these objectives presents major challenges and requires companies to have highly skilled professionals trained in many diverse and new technologies combined with industry-specific expertise. Increasingly, companies are relying on service providers operating with global delivery models, like Cognizant, to help them meet these ever-changing objectives.

Global demand for high quality, cost-effective technology services from outside providers has created a significant opportunity for IT service providers that can successfully leverage the benefits of and address the challenges in using a global talent pool. The effective use of personnel from across the globe can offer a variety of benefits, including deep industry expertise, lower costs, faster delivery of new IT solutions and innovations in industry-specific solutions, processes and technologies. Certain countries, particularly India, the Philippines, Singapore and China, have large talent pools of highly qualified technical professionals who can provide high quality IT and business process services at a lower cost. India is a leader in IT services and is regarded as having one of the largest and highest quality pools of talent in the world. Historically, IT service providers have used offshore labor pools primarily to supplement the internal staffing needs of customers. However, evolving customer demands have led to the increasing acceptance and use of offshore resources for higher value-added services. These services include application design, development, testing and systems integration, technology and industry-specific consulting and infrastructure management.











The Cognizant Approach

Our approach is built on a global network of delivery centers, deep domain expertise and a robust portfolio of industry-specific services.

Global Delivery Model.Our geographic reach extends across the globe, with more than 75 delivery centers worldwide. We have a four-tiered global architecture for service delivery and operations, consisting of employees co-located at clients’ sites, at local or in-country delivery centers, at regional delivery centers and at global delivery centers. We are continuously expanding global delivery capacity at our centers in the United States, India, Europe and other regions throughout the world. We use our proprietary Cognizant 2.0 knowledge-sharing and project-management platform to unite all of our operations around the globe, access capabilities across the Company and streamline workflow. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure facilitates the seamless integration of our global workforces.

Domain Expertise.Our business is organized and managed primarily around our four industry-oriented business segments:

•Financial Services;

•Healthcare;

•Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics; and

•Other, which includes Communications, Information, Media and Entertainment, and High Technology.

This industry focus has been central to our revenue growth and high client satisfaction. As the IT services industry continues to mature, clients are looking for service providers with a deep understanding of their businesses, industry initiatives, customers, markets and cultures, and that can create solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. To strengthen our industry practices, we hire professionals who are deeply experienced in the industries we serve, thus establishing a broad base of business analysts and consultants. We continually invest in industry training for our staff and build out industry-specific services and solutions. This approach is central to our high levels of on-time delivery and client satisfaction, as we understand the full context of our clients’ challenges and have deep experience in addressing them.

Portfolio of Services.We offer a broad range of services designed to help clients address business challenges and enhance their ability to pursue growth opportunities. Our key service areas, Consulting and Technology Services and Outsourcing Services, are delivered to our clients across our four business segments in a standardized, high-quality manner through our global delivery model.

Business Segments

We are organized around and report the operations of our business according to our four industry-oriented business segments:

Financial ServicesHealthcareManufacturing/Retail/LogisticsOther-Banking-Insurance-Healthcare-Life Sciences-Manufacturing and Logistics-Retail, Travel and Hospitality-Consumer Goods-Communications-Information, Media and Entertainment-High Technology









Financial Services

Our Financial Services business segment serves leading financial institutions throughout the world. Our clients include banks, investment firms and insurance companies. In 2014, this segment represented approximately41.8%of our total revenues. Revenues from our Financial Services business segment were$4,285.6 million, $3,717.6 million, and $3,035.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. This business segment provides services to our customers operating in the following industries:

•Banking. We serve traditional retail and commercial banks, diversified financial enterprises, broker-dealers, asset management firms, depositories, clearing organizations and exchanges. Our clients engage us to help make their operations as effective, productive and cost-efficient as possible, and to support new digital capabilities. We assist these clients in such areas as: Retail Banking, Wholesale Banking, Consumer Lending, Cards and Payments, Risk Management, Investment Banking and Brokerage, Asset and Wealth Management, and Securities Services.

The demand for our services in the banking sector is being driven by several significant changes in the industry. In response to the recent global economic crisis, central banks and government bodies have adopted policies designed to maintain low interest rates, raise capital requirements, impose new regulations, and institute risk-mitigation measures, such as restricting proprietary trading. Such actions have the effect of curtailing some revenue sources and increasing compliance costs for most financial institutions. In addition, financial institutions must consider adopting new digital technologies to change the way they interface with customers and employees and  manage their operations. We help our customers adapt to these changes by providing technology-based, industry-specific solutions. In addition to Application Development and Maintenance, the services increasingly in demand in this sector include EIM, Testing, Customer Relationship Management, or CRM, Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP, BPS, IT IS, and Business and Technology Consulting.

•Insurance. We serve global property and casualty insurers, life insurers, reinsurance firms and insurance brokers by improving the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and helping them with business transformation. We focus on such aspects of our clients’ operations as: Business Acquisition, Policy Administration, Claims Processing, Management Reporting, Regulatory Compliance and Reinsurance.

Among the factors driving the need for our services in the insurance industry is a desire to improve the sales and marketing process, both by deepening direct retail customer relationships and strengthening interactions with networks of independent and captive insurance agents, often through the use of social and mobile technologies. Insurers also seek to enhance their profitability by differentiating their products and services, resulting in a need for specialized underwriting models and systems. Additionally, many insurers seek to improve business effectiveness by reducing expense ratios and exiting non-core lines of business and operations. Our services which are most in demand in this sector include: Application Development and Integration, Consulting, BPS, IT IS, EIM, and digital services.

Healthcare

Our Healthcare business segment serves many leading healthcare and life sciences companies, and includes the post-acquisition operating results of TriZetto. In 2014, our Healthcare business segment represented approximately26.2%of our total revenues. Revenues from our Healthcare business segment were$2,689.4 million, $2,264.8 million, and $1,934.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively. This business segment provides services to our clients operating in the following industries:

•Healthcare.We work with many leading global healthcare organizations, including healthcare payers, providers and pharmacy benefit managers. The healthcare industry today faces the dual challenge of improving the quality of care while lowering the cost of care and making healthcare affordable to a larger population. A key factor driving this transformation has been the Affordable Care Act. In 2014, we acquired TriZetto to enhance our competitive position in the healthcare sector. TriZetto delivers world-class, healthcare IT solutions that enable healthcare organizations to work more efficiently and collaboratively.

Our Healthcare business focuses on providing a broad range of services and solutions that address regulatory requirements and emerging industry trends such as: Regulatory Compliance (including compliance with the Affordable Care Act and work related to state health insurance exchanges), Integrated Health Management (including establishing health information exchanges), EIM, Claims Investigative Services (aimed at preventing fraud and abuse and strengthening administrative processes), and Operational Improvement (in areas such as claims processing, enrollment, membership and billing). We also help our clients to enable their systems and processes to deal with the retail orientation of health care, such as the support of individual mandates and the adoption of mobile and analytics solutions to improve access to









health information and decision making by end consumers. Through our acquisition of TriZetto, we now develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products for the healthcare industry.

•Life Sciences.We partner with leading pharmaceutical, biotech, and medical device companies, as well as providers of generic, animal health and consumer health products, to assist them in transforming their business by becoming more efficient and effective from an IT and business operations perspective, while driving innovation and transformation to grow their business.

Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics

Our Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics business segment provides outsourcing, business consulting and technology services for global leaders in a range of sub-sectors, including industrial, automotive, process logistics, energy and utilities, and retail. In 2014, this segment represented approximately20.4%of our total revenues. Revenues from our Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics business segment were$2,093.6 million, $1,868.3 million, and $1,498.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

For transportation and distribution clients, our service areas include Warehouse and Yard Management, Transportation Asset Management, Transportation Network Design, Global Trade Management and Analytics.

Industry trends that influence the demand for our services in this sector include the increasing globalization of sourcing and the desire of clients to further penetrate emerging markets, leading to longer and more complex supply chains. In the power generation sector, industry trends include the continued energy conservation efforts, including “smart meter” installations, the need for better grid reliability and security, regulatory changes and the need to relieve cost pressures through better asset performance and web-based customer care systems. Clients also are optimizing their supply chains to better manage inventory, support growing eCommerce operations and improve customer-supplier collaboration. They are applying intelligent systems to manufacturing and logistics operations, enabling mobile platforms to support field sales and are using data analytics to make better informed decisions. These trends are driving demand for our offerings such as Enterprise Application Services, or EAS, EIM, Consulting and digital technologies.

•Retail, Travel and Hospitality.We serve a wide spectrum of retailers and distributors, including supermarkets, specialty premium retailers, department stores and large mass-merchandise discounters, who seek our assistance in becoming more efficient and cost-effective and in digitally transforming their businesses. Current trends affecting demand in the retail industry include a need for greater cost-efficiency to combat the industry’s traditionally narrow profit margins, changes in supply chain management to facilitate direct store delivery, the ability to accommodate









multi-channel (in-store and on-line) models, and the impact of digital technologies on customer and employee interaction.

Services in high demand in the retail sector include Consulting, eCommerce, EAS, Systems Integration, Testing, BPS and EIM. We also serve the entire travel and hospitality industry including airlines, hotels and restaurants, as well as online and retail travel, global distribution systems and intermediaries and real estate companies, providing solutions such as CRM, EIM and BPS.

Our expertise in these areas spans a wide range, from demand-driven supply chains, to revenue-creating trade promotion management systems, to analytics systems and mobility solutions that anticipate and serve ever-changing customer needs.

The demand for our services in this sector is driven by the need of consumer goods companies to accelerate product innovation to remain competitive and deliver top-line growth, the continuing drive to optimize global sourcing and supply chain management, the impact of digital technologies on consumer interaction, marketing and sales processes, the use of data analytics to increase the effectiveness of product development and marketing, as well as ongoing pressures to curtail IT costs. In response to these needs, we provide solutions including Application Development and Systems Integration, Consulting, CRM, EIM, Testing, BPS, IT IS and digital services.

Across our business segments, we are highly dependent upon our foreign operations. The majority of our development and delivery centers and technical professionals are located in India, and we also have facilities in Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Latin America. Our operations in India and the rest of the world expose us to various risks, including regulatory, economic and political instability, potentially unfavorable tax, import and export policies, fluctuations in foreign exchange and inflation rates, international and civil hostilities, terrorism, natural disasters and pandemics.

See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our business segments, including the disclosure of segment operating profit.

Our Solutions and Services

Across each of our business segments, we provide a broad and expanding range of consulting, information technology and outsourcing services, including:

Consulting and Technology Services

•Business, Process, Operations and IT Consulting. Our global consulting team, Cognizant Business Consulting, or CBC, helps clients re-imagine and transform their businesses to gain competitive advantage. As businesses explore new operating models, the value chain is being disaggregated to drive speed to market and agility.

CBC is built on a foundation of deep thought leadership and actionable strategies. CBC works with clients to improve business performance and operational productivity in order to exceed business goals. We also provide assistance with Strategy Consulting, Business and Operations Consulting, IT Strategy & Change Management, and Program Management Consulting.

Key factors driving the demand for CBC’s services are the following:

•The need to run the business better while increasing operational flexibility and reducing time to market;

•Optimizing big data and predictive analytics to gain competitive insight;

•Large business transformations, impacting business and IT operating models;

•Increased demands to collaborate and compete in the market for customers, capabilities and talent;

•The need to remove roadblocks in the Business/IT relationship to increase the return on technology investments, both directly and through positioning IT as a source of digital business innovation;

•Readiness to embrace virtualization capabilities, including greater infrastructure outsourcing and cloud solutions, with a focus on identifying and managing risk and cost; and

•Ongoing regulatory shifts, which require enhanced risk management and compliance frameworks as well as greater organizational resilience.

In this environment, the services currently provided by CBC include:

•IT strategy consulting to define new IT target operating and delivery models, and to optimize IT-to-business alignment, sourcing strategies and IT costs;

•Program management consulting, including post-acquisition integration, business and IT integration, business transformation, and large scale business transformation;

•Operations improvement consulting for business process management, operations strategy, global sourcing and supply chain management, and change management;

•Business consulting related to finance, risk advisory, human resources, marketing and analytics functions.

CBC is also expanding new services and capabilities in areas such as BPS, Supply Chain Management, Enterprise Analytics, EAS, and consulting related to the management of core assets and intellectual property, or IP.

•Application Development and Systems Integration. We offer a full range of Application Design, Application Development and Systems Integration services, which enable customers to focus on and invest in their core business activities and in growth-producing innovation, while ensuring that their IT functions operate in the most efficient, responsive and cost-effective manner. We have particular depth of skills in implementing large, complex, business-critical IT development and integration programs.









Demand for our Application Development and Systems Integration services is being driven by our customers' growing need to access outside capabilities to respond to the impact of changes in markets, regulation, competition and digital technologies on their businesses.

As part of our Application Development services, we define customer requirements, document specifications and design, develop, test and integrate software across multiple platforms, including Internet technologies. We modify and test applications to enable systems to function in new operating environments. In addition, these services include ERP and CRM implementation services. We follow one of two alternative approaches to application development and systems integration:

•full life-cycle application development, in which we assume start-to-finish responsibility for analysis, design, implementation, testing and integration of systems; or

•cooperative development, in which our employees work with a customer’s in-house IT personnel to jointly analyze, design, implement, test and integrate new systems.

In both of these approaches, our on-site team members work closely and collaboratively with our clients. Detailed design, implementation and testing are generally performed at dedicated near-shore and offshore development and delivery centers. In addition, we maintain an on-site presence at each customer location in order to address evolving client needs and resulting changes to the project.

A key part of our application development and systems integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate business applications with the rest of their operations. Using this suite of services, we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these new applications and websites with client servers and legacy systems. We build and deploy robust, scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries. We maintain competency centers specializing in various areas such as: Microsoft solutions; IBM, SAP, Oracle and Java applications; and Cloud Computing and Mobile solutions. These competency centers enable us to provide application development and integration services to a broad spectrum of clients.

Our re-engineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing environments to newer standards-based distribution architectures, often in response to the more stringent demands of business. Our re-engineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced technology platforms. We believe that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform re-engineering services. These tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to re-design target databases and convert certain programming languages. If necessary, our programmers also help clients re-design and convert user interfaces.

•Enterprise Information Management.Our EIM practice focuses on helping clients harness the vast amounts of data available on their operations, customers and markets, and to convert that data into information and insights that are valuable to their businesses and can be used to drive management decisions. We help clients identify the types of data available both within their organizations and from outside sources, including social media, and work to bring that data together in a meaningful “data to foresight” continuum. Among the trends driving this business are: the desire of companies to better understand consumer demands and market opportunities in order to create new products and services, the explosion of differently structured types of data from newly crafted business processes, the need to manage reporting requirements in regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services, and the pressures to manage operations more efficiently and cost-effectively through the use of analytical tools. Among the services we provide in the EIM area are the following:

•Strategic, advisory and management consulting services across Information Management, Business Intelligence & Analytics;

•Enterprise Data Management, including the creation of data warehouses, data marts, operational stores, enterprise master data management platforms, enterprise metadata platforms and enterprise data governance;

•Descriptive Analytics/ Business Intelligence that involves the strategy, design, build and management of information assets that drive day-to-day decision making;

•Strategic Corporate Performance Management, which enables clients to create executive dashboards or scorecards to better manage operations;

•Packaged Analytics designed to provide solutions to specific business problems leveraging technologies such as Mobile and Cloud; and

•Big Data services that assist clients in managing and deriving actionable insights from the explosion in the volume, variety, velocity and complexity of data.











•

Application Testing

•Digital Technologies Services, including Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud-based Technologies.We help clients implement digital technologies in their businesses. These technologies are now fundamental components of the enterprise IT architecture. These technologies are profoundly changing the way companies bring products and services to market and relate to and interact with their customers, employees and others. As such, these technologies may help companies achieve innovation-driven top line growth and efficiencies that improve the bottom line. As part of our services, we help clients analyze social media sentiment and build those insights into their customer relationship management process, as well as enabling clients to manage and analyze vast accumulations of data and use that data to drive management decisions. We also offer end-to-end services to enable cloud-based processes, from consulting and implementation to ongoing support activities.

•Software Solutions and Related Services.Through our 2014 acquisition of TriZetto, we now develop, license, implement and support proprietary and third-party software products for the healthcare industry, including solutions for health insurance plans, third party benefit administrators, or TPAs, and healthcare providers that enable healthcare organizations to work more efficiently and collaboratively to deliver better healthcare services. Our solutions help health plans and TPAs increase administrative efficiency, improve the cost and quality of care, and succeed in the retail healthcare market. Our solutions help physicians and healthcare organizations simplify business processes and execute strategies for population health management, accountable care, and value-based initiatives.

Outsourcing Services

•Application Maintenance. Our Application Maintenance service offering supports some or all of a client’s applications, ensuring that systems remain operational and responsive to changing user requirements and provide on-going enhancements as required by the client. Beyond the traditional view of IT outsourcing as a cost-saving measure, our Application Maintenance services enable clients to improve the overall agility, responsiveness, productivity and efficiency of their IT infrastructure. Increasingly, we also are assisting clients in adapting their IT systems to digital technologies.

By supporting some or all of a client’s applications, our services help ensure that a user’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to changing needs. As part of this process, we are often able to introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and on-going support. We also provide Application Value Management Solutions that can help balance cost, complexity and capacity and can help clients reduce cost of ownership, improve service levels and create new operational efficiencies.

Our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and cost-effective support services to our clients. Our on-site personnel often provide help-desk services at the client’s facility. These employees typically are available in the event of an emergency service request and are also able to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations. In the case of more complex maintenance services, including modifications, enhancements and documentation, which typically take a longer amount of time, we utilize our offshore resources to develop solutions more cost-effectively than would be possible locally.

As part of our Application Maintenance services, we assist clients in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations, new standards or other external events. We anticipate the operational









environment of our clients’ IT systems as we design and develop such systems. We also offer diagnostic services to assist clients in identifying issues in their IT systems and optimizing the performance of their systems.

•IT Infrastructure Services. We provide end-to-end IT Infrastructure Management Outsourcing services and anticipate continued growth for these services in the coming years. We provide service capability in redundant Global Operating Centers worldwide, through which we provide significant scale, quality and cost savings to our clients. Clients are increasingly utilizing IT IS to sharpen their focus on core business operations, reallocate overhead costs to growth investments, enable businesses to respond more quickly to changing demands, decrease time to market, ensure that the IT infrastructure can scale as the business evolves, and access skill sets outside the organization. The major services we provide include Data Center, Infrastructure Security, Network and Convergence, End-User Computing Services, and Mobility. We also have Cloud Services offerings that utilize virtualization technologies across delivery solutions for private cloud, enterprise multi-tenant cloud and public cloud models.

•Business Process Services.We provide BPS services through unique industry-aligned solutions that integrate process, domain and technology expertise to enable our clients to respond in an agile manner to market opportunities and challenges, while also creating variable cost structures to drive greater effectiveness and cost-efficiency. We have extensive domain-specific expertise in core front office, middle office and back office functions including Finance and Accounting, Procurement, Data Administration, Data Management, and Research and Analytics. Our industry-specific solutions include clinical data management, pharmacovigilance, equity research support, commercial operations and order management. In addition to BPS, related services include Consulting to ensure process excellence, and a range of platform-based services. Our goals for our client relationships are customer satisfaction, operational productivity, strategic value, and business transformation. Among the factors driving growth in our services are the desire to improve cost-effectiveness, the emergence of digital technologies, and the need for clients to access capabilities beyond their organizations to adapt to rapid changes in technologies, markets and customer demands.

Business Strategies

Our objectives are to maximize shareholder value and enhance our position as a leading provider of information technology, consulting and business process services. We implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives:

Growth through Reinvestment. We aim to invest our profits above the 19% to 20% non-GAAP operating margin level, excluding stock-based compensation expense and acquisition-related charges, back into our business. We believe this is a significant contributing factor to our strong revenue growth. This investment is primarily focused in the areas of: strengthening and expanding our portfolio of services; continuing to expand our geographic presence for both sales and delivery; hiring client partners and relationship personnel with specific industry experience or domain expertise; training our technical staff in a broader range of service offerings; recognizing and rewarding exceptional performance by our employees; and maintaining a level of resources, trained in a broad range of service offerings, to be well positioned to respond to our client requests, as described below.

•Expand Service Offerings and Solutions: We have several teams dedicated to creating innovative technology-based solutions and developing new, high value services. The teams collaborate with customers to develop these services. We are currently developing new offerings in Business and IT Consulting and industry-oriented IT solutions utilizing innovative technologies. We invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization to advance the development of new services and solutions. We also continue to enhance our capabilities and service offerings in the areas of CRM, ERP, EIM, Software Testing, Infrastructure Management, industry-oriented BPS services and digital technologies.

We believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will provide new sources of revenue, reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and foster long-term relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs. Additionally, as part of our vision to continue our growth and anticipate our clients’ and the markets’ rapidly changing demands in the near-term, mid-term and long-term, we are investing in emerging digital opportunities which will transform client and user platforms to Internet, cloud and mobile-based experiences.

•Expand Domestic and International Geographic Presence: We have established sales and marketing offices in various metropolitan areas in the United States and internationally. As we expand our customer base, we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices globally to support the demands of our clients and markets. This expansion is expected to facilitate sales and services to existing and new customers.

•Research and Development and Competency Centers: We have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and technologies, and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and









development around the latest technology developments. Most of our technical staff is trained in multiple technologies and architectures. As a result, we are able to react to clients’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy our technical staff to support a variety of technologies. Also, to develop and maintain this flexibility, we have made a substantial investment in our competency centers so that the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization. Through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education of our technical personnel, we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies. We believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster long-term relationships by having the capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new clients.

Enhance Processes, Methodologies and Productivity Toolsets

We have invested considerably in automation to improve process institutionalization across the organization. For example, we have built and deployed “Cognizant 2.0,” an intelligent delivery ecosystem which orchestrates processes, methodologies and best practices driving effective usage of knowledge, while providing a collaborative framework for our world-wide client service personnel. Our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization across different service lines, such as Application Development, Managed Services, Application Testing, BPS and IT IS.

Global Delivery Model.We have a four-tiered global architecture for service delivery and operations, consisting of employees co-located at clients’ sites, at local facilities or in-country delivery centers, at regional delivery centers and at global delivery centers. Our extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces. This is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work directly on client projects. This infrastructure allows for rapid completion of projects, highest level of quality, efficient use of clients’ technological resources and real-time access to project information by the on-site account manager or the client. In addition, for large projects with short time frames, our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time.  Key aspects of our global delivery model include:

•Two-in-a-Box Engagement Model: Our proprietary, trademarked client engagement model, called Two-in-a-Box, or TIB, represents our commitment to providing superior service to help clients reduce IT operational costs, embrace best practices and undergo sustainable business transformation. Centered on the needs of the client’s organization, TIB is designed specifically to help clients quickly reduce IT budgets, revamp IT operations and re-deploy freed-up assets to more strategic initiatives that generate business value. The TIB model includes a relationship management team, led by the Client Partner, or CP, with deep industry expertise, working onsite to absorb the client’s culture, operational processes, challenges and business goals and to assist with strategic planning. Another critical TIB team member is the dedicated global delivery manager, or DM. The relationship between the CP and DM is essential to ensure that our IT services are delivered with precision and that they are tailored to each client’s unique needs.

•Highly-Skilled Workforce: Our managers and senior technical personnel provide in-depth project management expertise to clients. To maintain this level of expertise, we place significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highly-skilled professionals. We have approximately30,000project managers and senior service delivery staff around the world, many of whom have significant work experience in North America, Europe and Asia. We also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and emerging technologies. We provide extensive combined classroom and on-the-job training to newly-hired technical staff, as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the business practices, tools, technology and consulting skills of our professional staff.









•Initiatives to Remain an Employer of Choice: As a rapidly growing professional services firm, a key attribute of our continued success is the ability to continually hire, assimilate, motivate and retain the best talent possible in the industry. We have developed strong relationships with key universities around the world, particularly in India, to provide a continual pipeline of talented staff from top-ranked schools. In addition, we have established an active lateral recruiting program in North America, Europe and India and an on-campus recruiting program in North America. We continue to expand our presence and brand in our key supply markets, further enhancing our ability to hire experienced professionals from competing IT services firms and industry to support our client needs and growth. We invest heavily in training programs, motivational programs and career development to ensure personal professional growth for each of our employees.

Further Development of Long-Term Client Relationships. We have strong long-term strategic relationships with our clients and business partners. We seek to establish long-term relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities, frequently trying to establish relationships with our clients’ chief information officers, or other IT and business decision makers, by offering a wide array of cost-effective high quality services. Approximately 97.1% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014 were derived from clients who had been using our services at the end of 2013. We also seek to leverage our experience with a client’s IT systems into new business opportunities. A successful track record and in-depth knowledge of a client’s processes and IT systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services can provide us with a competitive advantage in securing additional maintenance, development and other projects.

Pursuit of Selective Strategic Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances. We believe that opportunities continue to exist in the fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances. We believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence, service offering and capabilities more rapidly. For example, in 2014, we completed several acquisitions which we believe will accelerate our ability to provide multi-service integrated solutions to the healthcare industry and enhance our overall digital delivery capabilities. We believe that our fourth quarter acquisition of TriZetto, the largest acquisition in our history, broadens our offerings and creates an opportunity for us to cross-sell our business process, infrastructure management and consulting services to the TriZetto clients where we currently do not have relationships. More importantly, we believe a greater longer term opportunity exists for us to combine TriZetto’s platforms with our services and program management capabilities to create end-to-end integrated platform-based solutions that bring together infrastructure, applications, the cloud and business process services. During 2014, we completed three other acquisitions to strengthen our digital delivery capabilities across several industry groups.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel operating out of our Teaneck, New Jersey global headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world. The sales and marketing group works with our client delivery team as the sales process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider. The duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service, ranging from approximately two months to over one year.

Customers

The number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years. As of December 31,2014, we increased the number of strategic clients to271. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31,2014,2013, and2012. In addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradually declining revenues. For the years ended December 31,2014,2013, and2012,76.8%, 77.6%, and 79.4% of our revenue, respectively, was from North American customers. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional financial information by geographic area.

For the year ended December 31,2014, the distribution of our revenues across our business segments was as follows:41.8%from Financial Services,26.2%from Healthcare,20.4%from Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics and11.6%from Other.









We generally provide our services on a time-and-material, fixed price, or per-transaction basis. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a significant customer in one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. Presented in the table below is additional information about our customers.

We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, to protect our intellectual property and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, domain names, and copyrights. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we have also applied for or obtained a total of 624 trademark registrations in 60 countries. In addition, we have applied for or obtained 105 U.S. and international patents and patent applications and 146 U.S. and international copyright registrations covering certain of









our proprietary technology assets. Although we believe the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks and service marks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel.

Corporate History

We began our IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in-house technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, we, along with certain other entities, were spun-off from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, we completed an initial public offering of our Class A common stock. On June 30, 1998, a majority interest in us, and certain other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health. Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated.

On January 30, 2003, we filed a tender offer in which IMS Health stockholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for our Class B common stock held by IMS Health. On February 13, 2003, IMS Health distributed all of our Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to its stockholders. On February 21, 2003, pursuant to the terms of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all of the shares of Class B common stock automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock. Since February 21, 2003, there have been no outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Effective May 26, 2004, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, there are no authorized shares of Class B common stock.
