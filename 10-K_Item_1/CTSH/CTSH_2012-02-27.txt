Item 1.Business

Overview

We are a leading provider of custom information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. Our customers are
primarily Global 2000 companies. Our core competencies include Technology Strategy Consulting, Complex Systems Development and Integration, Enterprise Software Package Implementation and Maintenance, Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence and
Analytics, Application Testing, Application Maintenance, Infrastructure Management, and Business and Knowledge Process Outsourcing, or BPO and KPO. We tailor our services to specific industries, and utilize an integrated global delivery model. This
seamless global sourcing model combines technical and account management teams located on-site at the customer location and at dedicated near-shore and offshore development and delivery centers located primarily in India, China, the United States,
Canada, Argentina, Hungary and the Philippines.

Industry Background

Many companies today face intense competitive pressure and rapidly changing market dynamics, driven by such factors as changes in the
economy, government regulations, globalization, virtualization and other technology innovations. In response to these challenges, many companies are focused on improving efficiencies, enhancing effectiveness and driving innovation to favorably
impact both the bottom-line and the top-line. In order to achieve these goals, companies are focusing on a number of services, such as:



•Business and Information Technology, or IT, alignment;



•IT application and infrastructure optimization;



•Business and Knowledge Process effectiveness and efficiency;



•Complex custom systems development;



•Data Warehousing, Business Intelligence, or BI and Analytics;



•Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP;



•Customer Relationship Management, or CRM;



•Supply Chain Management;



•Enterprise 2.0 business models and technology solutions;



•Service-Oriented Architectures, Web 2.0 and Cloud Computing; and



•Engineering and Manufacturing solutions.

These solutions facilitate faster, more responsive and lower-cost business operations. However, their development, integration and on-going maintenance present major challenges and require a large number
of highly-skilled professionals trained in many diverse technologies and specialized industries. In addition, companies also require additional technical resources to maintain, enhance and re-engineer their core legacy IT systems and to address
application maintenance projects. Increasingly, companies are relying on custom IT solutions providers, such as us, to provide these services.

Additionally, in order to respond effectively to a changing and challenging business environment, IT departments of many companies have focused increasingly on improving returns on IT investments,
lowering costs and accelerating the delivery of new systems and solutions. To accomplish these objectives, many IT departments have shifted all or a portion of their IT development, integration and maintenance requirements to outside service
providers operating with global delivery models.







Using a globally distributed workforce to provide value-added services presents a number of challenges to IT services
and BPO/KPO providers. The offshore implementation of value-added IT services requires that IT service providers continually and effectively attract, train and retain highly-skilled software development professionals with advanced technical and
industry skills necessary to keep pace with continuing changes in information technology, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences. These skills are necessary to design, develop and deploy high-quality technology solutions in a
cost-effective and timely manner. In addition, IT service providers must have the methodologies, processes and communications capabilities to enable offshore workforces to be successfully integrated with on-site personnel. Service providers must
also have strong research and development capabilities, technology competency centers and relationship management skills in order to compete effectively.

The Cognizant Approach

Our business is organized and managed primarily
around our four vertically-oriented business segments:



•Financial Services;



•Healthcare;



•Manufacturing, Retail and Logistics; and



•Other, which includes Communications, Information, Media and Entertainment, and High Technology.

This vertical focus has been central to our revenue growth and high customer satisfaction. As the IT services industry continues to
mature, clients are looking for service providers who understand their businesses, industry initiatives, cultures and have solutions tailored to meet their individual business needs. We continue to hire experts out of industry, establish a broad
base of business analysts and consultants, invest in industry training for our staff, and build out industry-specific services and solutions. This approach is central to our high-levels of on-time delivery and customer satisfaction, as we understand
the full context of our clients’ challenges and have deep experience in addressing them.







Our key service areas, IT Consulting and Technology Services and Outsourcing Services are
delivered to our clients across our four business segments in a standardized, high-quality manner through a global delivery model. These service areas include:



•IT Consulting and Technology Services

Our Solution and Services

We believe that we have developed an effective integrated global delivery business model and this business model is expected to be a
critical element of our continued growth. To support this business model, at December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 137,700 professionals and support staff globally. We also have established facilities and technology and communication
infrastructures to support our business model.

Across each of our business segments, we provide a broad and expanding range
of consulting, information technology and outsourcing services, including:

Consulting and Technology Services



•IT Consulting. Our consulting division, Cognizant Business Consulting, focuses on helping clients derive greater value at the intersection of
their business initiatives and IT requirements. Our consulting offerings are based on rigorous and proven methodologies and scientifically driven frameworks. In the areas of business processes, technologies and offshoring, we analyze the existing
environment, identify opportunities for optimization and provide a robust roadmap for significant cost savings and productivity improvement. The broad areas of coverage include: offshoring strategy, IT strategy, technology rationalization, business
process rationalization, change management and IT solution strategy.



•Program Management Consulting. We provide a broad range of project delivery services, including post-acquisition integration, business and IT
integration, business transformation, product/service launch and organization relocation services.



•Application Design, Development, Integration and Re-engineering. We define customer requirements, write specifications and design, develop, test
and integrate software across multiple platforms including Internet technologies. We modify and test applications to enable systems to function in new operating environments. In addition, these services include Data Warehousing / Business
Intelligence, ERP and CRM implementation services. We follow either one of two alternative approaches to application development and integration:



•full life-cycle application development, in which we assume start-to-finish responsibility for analysis, design, implementation, testing and
integration of systems; or



•cooperative development, in which our employees work with a customer’s in-house IT personnel to jointly analyze, design, implement, test and
integrate new systems.

In both of these approaches, our on-site team members work closely and
collaboratively with our clients. Detailed design, implementation and testing are generally performed at dedicated near-shore and offshore development and delivery centers located primarily in India, China, the United States, Canada, Argentina,
Hungary and the Philippines. In addition, we maintain an on-site presence at each customer location in order to address evolving customer needs and resulting changes to the project.

A key part of our application development and integration offering is a suite of services to help organizations build and integrate
business applications with the rest of their operations. In this suite of services, we leverage our skills in business application development and enterprise application integration to build sophisticated business applications and to integrate these
new applications and







websites with client server and legacy systems. We build and deploy robust, scalable and extensible architectures for use in a wide range of industries. We maintain competency centers
specializing in various areas such as: Microsoft solutions; IBM, SAP, Oracle and JAVA applications; and Cloud Computing and Mobile solutions. These competency centers enable us to provide application development and integration services to a broad
spectrum of customers.

Our re-engineering service offerings assist customers migrating from systems based on legacy computing
environments to newer standards-based distribution architectures, often in response to the more stringent demands of business. Our re-engineering tools automate many of the processes required to implement advanced technology platforms. We believe
that this automation substantially reduces the time and cost to perform re-engineering services, savings that benefit both our customers and us. These tools also enable us to perform source code analysis and to re-design target databases and convert
certain programming languages. If necessary, our programmers also help customers re-design and convert user interfaces.



•Software Testing. Our Software Testing service offering has experienced significant growth in the past several years. Through this practice, we
provide an independent verification and validation service focused exclusively on supporting the software testing needs of our clients. Our testing service has four key offerings: 1) Independent Functional Testing; 2) Test Automation; 3) Test
Process Consulting; and 4) Performance Testing. We utilize our own Managed Test Center process model to ensure our clients receive the highest quality code possible after it has been tested by us. We focus our Managed Test Centers on specific
domains (e.g., specific industries and software solutions), ensuring we tailor our testing solutions to the particular needs of our clients.

Outsourcing Services



•Application Maintenance. Our Application Maintenance Service offering supports some or all of a customer’s applications ensuring that
systems remain operational and responsive to changing user requirements and provide on-going enhancements as required by the customer.

We provide services to help ensure that a customer’s core operational systems are free of defects and responsive to the customer’s changing needs. As part of this process, we are often able to
introduce product and process enhancements and improve service levels to customers requesting modifications and on-going support.

Our global delivery business model enables us to provide a range of rapid response and cost-effective support services to our customers. Our on-site team members often provide help-desk services at the
customer’s facility. These team members typically are available in the event of an emergency service request and are able to quickly resolve customer problems from remote locations. In the case of more complex maintenance services, including
modifications, enhancements and documentation, which typically have longer turnaround times, we take full advantage of our offshore resources to develop solutions more cost-effectively than would be possible relying on higher cost local
professionals. The services provided by our offshore team members are delivered to customers using satellite and fiber-optic communications.

As part of our Application Maintenance services, we assist customers in renovating their core systems to meet the requirements imposed by new regulations, new standards or other external events. These
services include, or have previously included, Year 2000 compliance, Eurocurrency compliance, decimalization within the securities industry and compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act for the healthcare industry.

We seek to anticipate the operational environment of our customers’ IT systems as we design and develop such systems. We
also offer diagnostic services to customers to assist them in identifying shortcomings in their IT systems and optimizing the performance of their systems.







•IT Infrastructure Services. We provide IT Infrastructure Management Outsourcing services and we anticipate growing demand for these services in
the coming years. We provide service capability in redundant Network Operating Centers, or NOCs, in North America and India through which we are able to provide significant scale, quality and cost savings to our clients in IT Infrastructure
Services. We focus on a number of key areas of infrastructure management such as: Networks, Servers, Middleware, Security, Vendors, Storage, Messaging, Databases, and Desktops. We can provide these through an IT Service Desk model, focusing on such
areas as IT Operations and IT Help Desk.



•Business and Knowledge Process Outsourcing, or BPO and KPO.We provide BPO and KPO services to our clients across industries of our
specialization. At Cognizant, we are primarily focused on value-added processes that are specific to clients in our key industry segments (particularly in Financial Services, Healthcare and Manufacturing / Retail / Logistics and Communications). Our
BPO/KPO practice focuses on core back office services covering: Transaction Processing, Accounting Operations, Voice Processes, Data Administration, Data Management and Data Analytics.

In addition to our industry-specific expertise and focus, our strengths, which we believe differentiate us from other IT service providers, include
the following:

Established and Scalable Proprietary Processes:We have a comprehensive process framework that
addresses the entire software engineering life cycle and support activities which are scalable for projects of different sizes and complexities. This proprietary framework, which we refer to as “Process Space” (part of Cognizant 2.0), is
supported by in-house project management, metrics management and workflow tools and is available to all of our programmers globally. Process Space has evolved since its original release in 1996 in breadth, depth and maturity, based on the
implementation feedback from projects and findings of internal quality audits and external assessments. Process capabilities are monitored at the sub-process level and performance targets are monitored at the process level, which are aligned with
the overall business objectives. Statistical process controls are used extensively to continuously monitor, predict and improve performance. Our Delivery Assurance group facilitates process implementation from the project inception and audits the
projects periodically to ensure that the implementation is effective and the risks are being managed.

Our process framework has been extensively adapted to cater to different types of projects managed by the organization across different service lines, such as Application Development, Managed Services,
Application Testing, BPO and IT Infrastructure Management. In our goal of achieving the highest level of Delivery Excellence, we are also driving an initiative called Best-In-Class framework throughout the organization.







Highly-Skilled Workforce.Our managers and senior technical personnel provide
in-depth project management expertise to customers. To maintain this level of expertise, we place significant emphasis on recruiting and training our workforce of highly-skilled professionals. We have approximately 16,200 project managers and senior
technical personnel around the world, many of whom have significant work experience in North America, Europe and Asia. We also maintain programs and personnel to hire and train the best available technical professionals in both legacy systems and
emerging technologies. We provide extensive combined classroom and on-the-job training to newly hired technical staff, as well as additional annual training programs designed to enhance the business practices, tools, technology and consulting skills
of our professional staff. We were assessed by KPMG at Level 5 (the highest possible rating) of the People Capability Maturity Model, or P-CMM, of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. This widely recognized means of
implementing current best practices in fields such as human resources, knowledge management and organizational development help improve our processes for managing and developing our workforce and addressing critical people issues.

Research and Development and Competency Centers. We have project experience and expertise across multiple architectures and
technologies, and have made significant investments in our competency centers and in research and development to keep abreast of the latest technology developments. Most of our technical staff are trained in multiple technologies and architectures.
As a result, we are able to react to customers’ needs quickly and efficiently redeploy our technical staff to different technologies. Also, to develop and maintain this flexibility, we have made a substantial investment in our competency
centers so that the experience gained from particular projects and research and development efforts is leveraged across our entire organization. In addition, through our investment in research and development activities and the continuing education
of our technical personnel, we enlarge our knowledge base and develop the necessary skills to keep pace with emerging technologies. We believe that our ability to work in new technologies allows us to foster long-term relationships by having the
capacity to continually address the needs of both existing and new customers.

Well-Developed Infrastructure.Our
extensive facilities, technology and communications infrastructure facilitate the seamless integration of our global workforces. This is accomplished by permitting team members in different locations to access common project information and to work
directly on customer projects. This infrastructure allows for:



•rapid completion of projects;



•highest level of quality;



•off-peak use of customers’ technological resources; and



•real-time access to project information by the on-site account manager or the customer.

International time differences enable our offshore teams to access a customer’s computing facilities located in North America,
Europe, the Asia Pacific region and other countries in which we provide services during off-peak hours. This ability to perform services during off-peak hours enables us to complete projects more rapidly and does not require our customers to invest
in duplicative hardware and software. In addition, for large projects with short time frames, our offshore facilities allow for parallel processing of various development phases to accelerate delivery time. In addition, we can deliver services more
rapidly than some competitors without an offshore labor pool because our lower labor costs enable us to cost-effectively assign more professionals to a project.

Business Strategies

Our objectives are to maximize stockholder value and
enhance our position as a leading provider of custom information technology, consulting and business process outsourcing services. We implement the following core strategies to achieve these objectives:

Expand Service Offerings and Solutions.We have several teams dedicated to creating technology-based innovative solutions and
developing new, high value services. The teams collaborate with customers to develop







these services. For example, we are currently developing new offerings in Business and IT Consulting and vertically-oriented IT solutions atop innovative technologies such as: Service Oriented
Architectures, or SOA, and Web 2.0. We invest in internal research and development and promote knowledge building and sharing across the organization to advance the development of new services and solutions. Furthermore, we continue to enhance our
capabilities and service offerings in the areas of:



•Customer Relationship Management, or CRM;



•Enterprise Resource Planning, or ERP;



•Data Warehousing / Business Intelligence, or BI;



•Software Testing;



•Infrastructure Management; and



•Vertically-Oriented Business and Knowledge Process Outsourcing, or BPO and KPO.

We believe that the continued expansion of our service offerings will reduce our reliance on any one technology initiative and may help
foster long-term relationships with our customers by allowing us to better serve their needs. Among service offerings, Infrastructure Management and Vertically-Oriented Business and Knowledge Process Outsourcing have been among the key drivers of
growth.

As part of our vision to preserve our growth and to stay ahead of our clients’ and the markets’ rapidly
changing demands in the near-term, mid-term and long-term, we are investing in emerging opportunities which seek to transform client and user platforms to internet, cloud and mobile based experiences.

Further Develop Long-Term Customer Relationships.We have strong long-term strategic relationships with our customers and business
partners. We seek to establish long-term relationships that present recurring revenue opportunities, frequently trying to establish relationships with our customers’ chief information officers, or other IT and business decision makers, by
offering a wide array of cost-effective high quality services. Approximately 97% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011 were derived from customers who had been using our services at the end of 2010. We also seek to leverage our
experience with a customer’s IT systems into new business opportunities. Knowledge of a customer’s processes and IT systems gained during the performance of application maintenance services, for example, may provide us with a competitive
advantage in securing additional maintenance, development and other projects from that customer.

Enhance Processes,
Methodologies and Productivity Toolsets.With the globalization of business, we are committed to improving and enhancing our proprietary Process Space software engineering process and other methodologies and toolsets. In light of the rapid
evolution of technology, we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our continued success. We are constantly designing and developing additional productivity software tools to automate testing processes and
improve project estimation and risk assessment techniques. For example, we have created and rolled out “Cognizant 2.0” which uses groupware technology based on Web 2.0 technologies, enabling Cognizant associates to share project
experiences and best practice methodologies across the organization with the objective of improving productivity.

Expand
Domestic and International Geographic Presence. As we expand our customer base, we plan to open additional sales and marketing offices in North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, and the Middle East. This expansion is expected to facilitate
sales and services to existing and new customers. We have established sales and marketing offices in various metropolitan areas both in the United States and internationally.

Continue to be an Employer of Choice in the Industry.As a rapidly growing professional services firm, a key attribute of our continued success is the ability to continually hire, assimilate,
motivate and retain the best talent possible in the industry. We have developed strong relationships with key universities around the world, particularly in India, to provide a continual funnel of talented staff from Tier One schools. In addition,
we







continue to expand our presence and brand in our key supply markets, further enhancing our ability to hire experienced professionals from competing IT services firms and industry to support our
client needs and growth. We invest heavily in training programs (centered around Cognizant Academy), motivational programs and career development to ensure personal professional growth for each of our associates.

Pursue Selective Strategic Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Strategic Alliances. We believe that opportunities exist in the
fragmented market in which we operate to expand our business through selective strategic acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances. We believe that acquisition and joint venture candidates may enable us to expand our geographic presence
and our capabilities more rapidly, especially in geographic markets and key industries. For example, in 2011, we completed two acquisitions to strengthen our business process and analytics solution offerings and enhance our retail SAP capabilities.
In addition, through our working relationships with independent software vendors we obtain projects using the detailed knowledge we gain in connection with a joint development process. Finally, we expect to continue to form strategic alliances with
select IT service firms that offer complementary services to best meet the requirements of our customers.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell our services directly through our professional staff, senior management and direct sales personnel
operating out of our Teaneck, New Jersey headquarters and our business development offices which are strategically located in various metropolitan areas around the world. The sales and marketing group works with our technical team as the sales
process moves closer to the customer’s selection of a services provider. The duration of the sales process varies depending on the type of service, ranging from approximately two months to over one year. The account manager or sales executive
works with the technical team to:



•define the scope, deliverables, assumptions and execution strategies for a proposed project;



•develop project estimates;



•prepare pricing and margin analyses; and



•finalize sales proposals.

Management reviews and approves proposals, which are then presented to the prospective customer. Our sales and account management personnel remain actively involved in the project through the execution
phase. We focus our marketing efforts on businesses with intensive information processing needs. We maintain a prospect/customer database that is continuously updated and used throughout the sales cycle from prospect qualification to close. As a
result of this marketing system, we pre-qualify sales opportunities, and direct sales representatives are able to minimize the time spent on prospect qualification. In addition, substantial emphasis is placed on customer retention and expansion of
services provided to existing customers. In this regard, our account managers play an important marketing role by leveraging their ongoing relationship with the customer to identify opportunities to expand and diversify the type of services provided
to that customer.

Customers

The number of customers served by us has increased significantly in recent years. As of December 31, 2011, we were providing services to approximately 785 customers, as compared to approximately 712
customers as of December 31, 2010, and approximately 589 customers as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2011, we increased the number of strategic clients to 191. We define a strategic client as one offering the potential to
generate at least $5 million to $50 million or more in annual revenues at maturity. Accordingly, we provide a significant volume of services to many customers in each of our business segments. Therefore, a loss of a significant customer or
a few significant customers in a particular segment could materially reduce revenues for such segment. However, no individual customer exceeded 10.0% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. In
addition, the services we provide to our larger customers are often critical to the operations of such customers and a termination of our services generally would require an extended transition period with gradual declining revenues. For the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, 78.5%, 78.0%, and 79.1% of our revenue, respectively, was from North American customers.







For the year ended December 31, 2011, we derived our revenues from the following
business segments: 41.1% from Financial Services, 26.5% from Healthcare, 19.6% from Manufacturing/Retail/Logistics and 12.8% from Other.

We provide services either on a time-and-material basis or on a fixed price basis. The volume of work performed for specific customers is likely to vary from year to year, and a significant customer in
one year may not use our services in a subsequent year. Presented in the table below is additional information about our customers.

Intellectual Property

Our intellectual property rights are important to
our business. We presently hold no patents or registered copyrights. Instead, we rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. We
require our employees, independent contractors, vendors and customers to enter into written confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their relationships with us. These agreements generally provide that any confidential or proprietary

Employees

We finished the year 2011 with headcount of approximately 137,700. We employed approximately 111,600 persons in the Asia Pacific
region, approximately 21,800 persons in various locations throughout North America and Latin America and over 4,300 persons in various locations throughout Europe, principally in the United Kingdom. We are not party to any significant
collective bargaining agreements. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.

Our future success depends to a
significant extent on our ability to attract, train and retain highly-skilled IT development and other professionals. In particular, we need to attract, train and retain project managers, programmers and other senior technical personnel. We believe
there is a shortage of, and significant competition for, IT development professionals in the United States, Europe and in India with the advanced technological skills necessary to perform the services we offer. We have an active recruitment program
in India, and have developed a recruiting system and database that facilitates the rapid identification of skilled candidates. During the course of the year, we conduct extensive recruiting efforts at premier colleges and technical schools in India.
We evaluate candidates based on academic performance, the results of a written aptitude test measuring problem-solving skills and a technical interview. In addition, we have an active lateral recruiting program in North America, Europe and India and
have established an on-campus recruiting program in North America. A substantial majority of the personnel on most on-site teams and virtually all the personnel staffed on offshore teams is comprised of Indian nationals.

Our senior project managers are hired from leading consulting firms in the United States, Europe and India. Our senior management and
most of our project managers have experience working in the United States and Europe. This enhances our ability to attract and retain other professionals with experience in the United States and Europe. We have also adopted a career and education
management program to define our employees’ objectives and career plans. We have implemented an intensive orientation and training program to introduce new employees to the Process Space software engineering process, our other technologies and
our services.

Corporate History

We
began our IT development and maintenance services business in early 1994, as an in-house technology development center for The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation and its operating units. In 1996, we, along with certain other entities, were
spun-off from The Dun & Bradstreet Corporation to form a new company, Cognizant Corporation. On June 24, 1998, we completed an initial public offering of our Class A common stock. On June 30, 1998, a majority interest in us,
and certain other entities were spun-off from Cognizant Corporation to form IMS Health. Subsequently, Cognizant Corporation was renamed Nielsen Media Research, Incorporated.

On January 30, 2003, we filed a tender offer in which IMS Health stockholders could exchange IMS Health shares held by them for our Class B common stock held by IMS Health. On February 13, 2003,
IMS Health distributed all of our Class B common stock that IMS Health owned in an exchange offer to its stockholders. On February 21, 2003, pursuant to the terms of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, all of the shares of Class B common
stock automatically converted into shares of Class A common stock. Since February 21, 2003, there have been no outstanding shares of Class B common stock. Effective May 26, 2004, pursuant to our Certificate of Incorporation, there are
no authorized shares of Class B common stock.
