General

Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation, doing business as Wabtec Corporation, is a Delaware corporation with headquarters at 1001 Air Brake Avenue in Wilmerding, Pennsylvania. Our telephone number is 412-825-1000, and our website is located atwww.wabtec.com. All references to “we”, “our”, “us”, the “Company” and “Wabtec” refer to Westinghouse Air Brake Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries. Westinghouse Air Brake Company (“WABCO”) was formed in 1990 when it acquired certain assets and operations from American Standard, Inc., now known as Trane (“Trane”). In 1999, WABCO merged with MotivePower Industries, Inc. (“MotivePower”) and adopted the name Wabtec.

Today, Wabtec is one of the world’s largest providers of value-added, technology-based equipment and services for the global rail industry. We believe we hold approximately a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading position in North America for most of our other product lines. Our highly engineered products, which are intended to enhance safety, improve productivity and reduce maintenance costs for customers, can be found on virtually all U.S. locomotives, freight cars, subway cars and buses, and on many of these vehicles around the world. In2015, the Company had sales of approximately$3.3 billionand net income of about$398.6 million. In2015, sales of aftermarket parts and services represented about62%of total sales, while sales to customers outside of the U.S. accounted for about47%of total sales.

Industry Overview

The Company primarily serves the worldwide freight rail and passenger transit industries. As such, our operating results are largely dependent on the level of activity, financial condition and capital spending plans of the global railroad and transit industries. Many factors influence these industries, including general economic conditions; traffic volumes, as measured by freight tonnage and passenger ridership; government spending on public transportation; and investment in new technologies by freight rail and passenger transit systems.

According to a recent study by UNIFE, the Association of the European Rail Industry, the accessible global market for railway products and services is more than $100 billion, and it is expected to grow at about 2.7% annually through 2019. The three largest markets, which represent about 75% of the total market, are Europe, Asia-Pacific and North America. UNIFE projects the overall market to remain stable through 2020 as emerging markets show above-average growth due to overall economic growth and trends such as urbanization and increasing mobility, deregulation, investments in new technologies, energy and environmental issues, and increasing government support; while developed markets grow at a slower pace. UNIFE projects growth in all major product segments, with rail control and services expected to grow the fastest, at about 3% each.

By using various industry publications and market studies, we estimate that the global installed base of locomotives is about 110,000 units, with about 35% in Asia-Pacific, about 25% in Russia-CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) and about 20% in North America.  We estimate the global installed base of freight cars is about 5.2 million units, with about 30% each in Russia-CIS and North America, and about 20% in Asia-Pacific.  We estimate the global installed base of transit cars is about 330,000 units, with about 55% in Asia-Pacific, about 20% in Europe and about 10% in Russia.










In the U.S., the passenger transit industry is dependent largely on funding from federal, state and local governments, and from fare box revenues. The New York City region is the largest passenger transit market in the U.S., but most major cities also offer either rail or bus transit services. Demand for North American passenger transit products is driven by a number of factors, including government funding, deliveries of new subway cars and buses, and ridership. The U.S. federal government provides money to local transit authorities, primarily to fund the purchase of new equipment and infrastructure for their transit systems. In 2015, the U.S. Congress passed a five-year transportation funding bill that includes transit spending of about $11.8 billion in fiscal 2016, an increase of about 10% compared to the prior year.  The number of new transit cars delivered in 2015 was about 850, compared to about the same in 2014. The number of new buses delivered in 2015 was about 4,600 compared to about the same in 2014. In the past 10 years, the average number of new transit cars delivered annually is about 800, and the average number of new buses delivered annually is about 4,700.



Public transit ridership provides fare box revenues to transit authorities, which use these funds, along with state and local money, primarily for equipment and system maintenance. Based on preliminary figures from the American Public Transportation Association, ridership on U.S. transit vehicles decreased about 1.0% in 2015.

Outside of North America, countries such as Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, and South Africa have been investing capital to expand and improve both their freight and passenger rail systems. Throughout the world, some government-owned railroads are being sold to private owners, who often look to improve the efficiency of the rail system by investing in new equipment and new technologies. According to UNIFE, emerging markets are expected to grow at above-average rates as global trade creates increases in freight volumes and urbanization leads to increased demand for efficient mass-transportation systems. As this growth occurs, Wabtec expects to have additional opportunities to provide products and services in these markets.

The Asia/Pacific market is now the second-largest geographic segment, according to UNIFE. This market consists primarily of China, India and Australia. Growth has been driven by the continued urbanization of China and India, and by investments in freight rail infrastructure to serve the mining and natural resources markets in those countries.  We estimate that this market consists of 35,000 locomotives and about 1.0 million freight cars.  China is expected to increase spending on rail infrastructure and equipment, as it resumes investment in high-speed rail programs.  In its most recent report, the Indian government reported that in the first six months of its fiscal 2015, freight rail volume increased about 26% and earnings from passenger rail traffic increased about 8.5%. India is expected to increase spending significantly in future years as it seeks to modernize its rail system; for example, it recently awarded a 1,000-unit locomotive order to a U.S. manufacturer.

Other key geographic markets include Russia-CIS, South Africa, and Brazil.  With about 1.5 million freight cars and about 28,000 locomotives, Russia-CIS is among the largest freight rail markets in the world, and it’s expected to invest significantly in new rolling stock and infrastructure.  Russian Railways, a state-owned company, provides both freight and passenger transportation.  In 2015, Russian Railways announced a decrease of 1.2% in freight loadings and a decrease of 4.4% in passenger ridership.  South Africa, in 2012, announced a major program to invest in its freight rail and passenger transit infrastructure during the next 20 years.  As part of this program, PRASA, the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa, plans to purchase about 3,600 new transit cars and about 1,000 new locomotives.  Brazil has also been investing in its passenger transport systems in advance of hosting the 2016 Olympics.

Business Segments and Products

We provide our products and services through two principal business segments, the Freight Segment and the Transit Segment, both of which have different market characteristics and business drivers.

The Freight Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing locomotive and freight cars, supplies railway electronics, positive train control equipment, signal design and engineering services, builds switcher










locomotives, rebuilds freight locomotives and provides heat exchangers and cooling systems for rail and other industrial markets. Customers include large, publicly traded railroads, leasing companies, manufacturers of original equipment such as locomotives and freight cars, and utilities. As discussed previously, demand in the freight market is primarily driven by rail traffic, and deliveries of new locomotives and freight cars. In2015, the Freight Segment accounted for62%of our total sales, with about81%of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. In2015, slightly more than half of the Freight Segment’s sales were in aftermarket.

The Transit Segment primarily manufactures and services components for new and existing passenger transit vehicles, typically subway cars and buses, builds new commuter locomotives and refurbishes subway cars. Customers include public transit authorities and municipalities, leasing companies, and manufacturers of subway cars and buses around the world. As discussed previously, demand in the transit market is primarily driven by government funding at all levels and passenger ridership. In2015, the Transit Segment accounted for38%of our total sales, with about39%of its sales in North America and the remainder to international customers. About two-thirds of the Transit Segment’s sales are in the aftermarket with the remainder in the original equipment market.

Following is a summary of our leading product lines in both aftermarket and original equipment across both of our business segments:

Specialty Products & Electronics:

•Positive Train Control equipment and electronically controlled pneumatic braking products

•Railway electronics, including event recorders, monitoring equipment and end of train devices

•Signal design and engineering services

•Freight car truck components

•Draft gears, couplers and slack adjusters

•Air compressors and dryers

•Heat exchangers and cooling products for locomotives and power generation equipment

Transit Products:

•Door and window assemblies for buses and subway cars

•Accessibility lifts and ramps for buses and subway cars

•Traction motors

We have become a leader in the rail industry by capitalizing on the strength of our existing products, technological capabilities and new product innovation, and by our ability to harden products to protect them from severe conditions, including extreme temperatures and high-vibration environments. Supported by our technical staff of over1,500engineers and specialists, we have extensive experience in a broad range of product lines, which enables us to provide comprehensive, systems-based solutions for our customers.

Over the past several years, we introduced a number of significant new products, including electronic braking equipment and train control equipment that encompasses onboard digital data and global positioning communication protocols. In 2007, for example, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved the use of our Electronic Train Management System®, which offers safety benefits to the rail industry. In 2008, the U.S. federal government enacted a rail safety bill that mandates the use of Positive Train Control (“PTC”) technology, which includes on-board locomotive computer and related software, on a majority of the locomotives and track in the U.S. With our Electronic Train Management System®, we are the leading supplier of this on-board train control equipment, and we are working with the U.S. Class I railroads, commuter rail authorities and other industry suppliers to implement this technology.  The rail safety bill included a deadline of December 31, 2015 for PTC










implementation, but the deadline has been extended until the end of 2018.  The deadline extension is expected to affect the rate of industry spending on this technology.  In2015, Wabtec recorded about$400 millionof revenue from freight and transit PTC projects.

For additional information on our business segments, see Note 20 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part IV, Item 15 of this report.

Competitive Strengths

Our key strengths include:

•Leading market positions in core products. Dating back to 1869 and George Westinghouse’s invention of the air brake, we are an established leader in the development and manufacture of pneumatic braking equipment for freight and passenger transit vehicles. We have leveraged our leading position by focusing on research and engineering to expand beyond pneumatic braking components to supplying integrated parts and assemblies for the locomotive through the end of the train. We are a recognized leader in the development and production of electronic recording, measuring and communications systems, positive train control equipment, highly engineered compressors and heat exchangers for locomotives, and a leading manufacturer of freight car components, including electronic braking equipment, draft gears, trucks, brake shoes and electronic end-of-train devices. We are also a leading provider of braking equipment, door assemblies, lifts and ramps, couplers and current collection equipment for passenger transit vehicles.

•Breadth of product offering with a stable mix of original equipment market (OEM) and aftermarket business. Our product portfolio is one of the broadest in the rail industry, as we offer a wide selection of quality parts, components and assemblies across the entire train. We provide our products in both the original equipment market and the aftermarket. Our substantial installed base of products with end-users such as the railroads and the passenger transit authorities is a significant competitive advantage for providing products and services to the aftermarket because these customers often look to purchase safety- and performance-related replacement parts from the original equipment components supplier. In addition, as OEMs and railroad operators attempt to modernize fleets with new products designed to improve and maintain safety and efficiency, these products must be designed to be interoperable with existing equipment. On average, over the last several years, more than60%of our total net sales have come from our aftermarket products and services business.

•Leading design and engineering capabilities. We believe a hallmark of our relationship with our customers has been our leading design and engineering practice, which has, in our opinion, assisted in the improvement and modernization of global railway equipment. We believe both our customers and the government authorities value our technological capabilities and commitment to innovation, as we seek not only to enhance the efficiency and profitability of our customers, but also to improve the overall safety of the railways through continuous improvement of product performance. The Company has an established record of product improvements and new product development. We have assembled a wide range of patented products, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Wabtec currently owns2,312active patents worldwide and621U.S. patents. During the last three years, we have filed for more than403patents worldwide in support of our new and evolving product lines.

•Experience with industry regulatory requirements.The freight rail and passenger transit industries are governed by various government agencies and regulators in each country and region. These groups mandate rigorous manufacturer certification, new product testing and approval processes that we believe are difficult for new entrants to meet cost-effectively and efficiently without the scale and extensive experience we possess.

•Experienced management team and the Wabtec Performance System. The Company has implemented numerous initiatives that enable us to manage successfully through cycles in the rail supply market. For example, the Wabtec Performance System (WPS), an ongoing program that focuses on lean manufacturing principles and continuous improvement across all aspects of our business, has been a part of the Company’s culture for more than 20 years. As a result, our management team has improved our cost structure, operating leverage and financial flexibility, and placed the Company in an excellent position to benefit from growth opportunities.

Business strategy

Using WPS, we strive to generate sufficient cash to invest in our growth strategies and to build on what we consider to be a leading position as a low-cost producer in the industry while maintaining world-class product quality, technology and customer responsiveness. Through WPS and employee-directed initiatives such as Kaizen, a Japanese-developed team concept, we continuously strive to improve quality, delivery and productivity, and to reduce costs. These efforts enable us to streamline processes, improve product reliability and customer satisfaction, reduce product cycle times and respond more rapidly to market developments. Over time, these lean initiatives have enabled us to increase operating margins, improve cash flow and strengthen our ability to invest in the following growth strategies:










•Expand globally and into new product markets. We believe that international markets represent a significant opportunity for future growth. In2015, sales to non-U.S. customers were$1.6 billion, including export sales from the Company’s U.S. operations of$508.4 million. We intend to increase our existing international sales through strategic acquisitions, direct sales of products through our existing subsidiaries and licensees, and joint ventures with railway suppliers which have a strong presence in their local markets. We are specifically targeting markets that operate significant fleets of U.S.-style locomotives and freight cars, including Australia, Brazil, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and other select areas within Europe and South America. In addition, we have opportunities to increase the sale of certain products that we currently manufacture for the rail industry into other industrial markets, such as mining, off-highway and energy. These products include heat exchangers and friction materials.

•Expand aftermarket sales. Historically, aftermarket sales are less cyclical than OEM sales because a certain level of aftermarket maintenance and service work must be performed, even during an industry slowdown. In2015, Wabtec’s aftermarket sales and services represented approximately62%of the Company’s total sales across both of our business segments. Wabtec provides aftermarket parts and services for its components, and the Company is seeking to expand this business with customers who currently perform the work in-house. In this way, we expect to take advantage of the rail industry trend toward outsourcing, as railroads and transit authorities focus on their core function of transporting goods and people.

•Accelerate new product development. We continue to emphasize research and development funding to create new and improved products. We are focusing on technological advances, especially in the areas of electronics, braking products and other on-board equipment, as a means of new product growth. We seek to provide customers with incremental technological advances that offer immediate benefits with cost-effective investments.

•Seek acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. We invest in acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances using a disciplined, selective approach and rigorous financial criteria. These transactions are expected to meet the financial criteria and contribute to our growth strategies of global expansion, new products and expanding aftermarket sales. All of these expansion strategies will help Wabtec to grow profitably, expand geographically, and dampen the impact from potential cycles in the North American rail industry.

Recent Acquisitions and Joint Ventures

Wabtec has completed certain significant acquisitions in support of its growth strategies mentioned above:

•OnOctober 30, 2015, the Company acquired Relay Monitoring Systems PTY Ltd. (“RMS”), an Australian manufacturer of electrical protection and control products for a purchase price of approximately$18.7 million, net of cash acquired.

•OnOctober 8, 2015, the Company acquired Track IQ, an Australian based manufacturer of wayside censor systems for the global rail industry for a purchase price of approximately$9.1 million, net of cash acquired.

•OnJune 6, 2014, the Company acquired Fandstan Electric Group Ltd. (“Fandstan”), a leading rail and industrial equipment manufacturer for a variety of markets, including rail and tram transportation, industrial and energy, for a purchase price of approximately$199.4 million, net of cash acquired.

Backlog

The Company’s backlog was about$2.1 billionatDecember 31, 2015. For2015, about62%of total sales came from aftermarket orders, which typically carry lead times of less than 30 days, and are not recorded in backlog for a significant period of time.

The Company’s contracts are subject to standard industry cancellation provisions, including cancellations on short notice or upon completion of designated stages. Substantial scope-of-work adjustments are common. For these and other










reasons, completion of the Company’s backlog may be delayed or cancelled. The railroad industry, in general, has historically been subject to fluctuations due to overall economic conditions and the level of use of alternative modes of transportation.

The backlog of firm customer orders as ofDecember 31, 2015andDecember 31, 2014, and the expected year of completion are as follows:

Engineering and Development

To execute our strategy to develop new products, we invest in a variety of engineering and development activities. For the fiscal years ended December 31,2015,2014, and2013, we invested about$71.2 million,$61.9 millionand$46.3 million, respectively, on product development and improvement activities. The engineering resources of the Company are allocated between research and development activities and the execution of original equipment customer contracts.

Our engineering and development program includes investment in train control and new braking technologies, with an emphasis on applying electronics to traditional pneumatic equipment. Electronic braking has been used in the transit industry for years, and freight railroads are conducting pilot programs to test its reliability and benefits. Freight railroads have generally been slower to accept the technology due to issues over interoperability, connectivity and durability. We are proceeding with efforts to enhance the major components for existing hard-wired braking equipment and development of new electronic technologies for the freight railroads. We are also investing in technology, such as advanced cooling systems that enable lower emissions from diesel engines used in rail and other industrial markets.  Sometimes we conduct specific research projects in conjunction with universities, customers and other industry suppliers.

We use our Product Development System (PDS) to develop and monitor new product programs. The system requires the product development team to follow consistent steps throughout the development process, from concept to launch, to ensure the product will meet customer expectations and internal profitability targets.

Intellectual Property

We have2,312active patents worldwide. We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and other intellectual property laws, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our intellectual property.

Certain trademarks, among them the name WABCO®, were acquired or licensed from American Standard Inc., now known as Trane, in 1990 at the time of our acquisition of the North American operations of the Railway Products Group of Trane. Other trademarks have been developed through the normal course of business, or acquired as a part of our ongoing merger and acquisition program.

We have entered into a variety of license agreements as licensor and licensee. We do not believe that any single license agreement is of material importance to our business or either of our business segments as a whole.

We have issued licenses to the two sole suppliers of railway air brakes and related products in Japan, Nabtesco and Mitsubishi Electric Company. The licensees pay annual license fees to us and also assist us by acting as liaisons with key Japanese passenger transit vehicle builders for projects in North America. We believe that our relationships with these licensees have been beneficial to our core transit business and customer relationships in North America.

Customers

Our customers include railroads and passenger transit authorities throughout North America, as well as in the United Kingdom, Australia, Europe, Asia, South Africa and South America; manufacturers of transportation equipment, such as locomotives, freight cars, subway vehicles and buses; and lessors of such equipment.

Top customers can change from year to year. For the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2015, our top five customers accounted for22%of net sales: The BNSF Railway, CSX Corporation, General Electric Transportation, Trinity Industries, and Union Pacific Corporation. No one customer represents 10% or more of consolidated sales. We believe that we have strong relationships with all of our key customers.












Competition

We believe that we hold approximately a 50% market share in North America for our primary braking-related equipment and a leading market position in North America for most of our other product lines. On a global basis, our market shares are smaller. We operate in a highly competitive marketplace. Price competition is strong because we have a relatively small number of customers and they are very cost-conscious. In addition to price, competition is based on product performance and technological leadership, quality, reliability of delivery, and customer service and support.

Our principal competitors vary across product lines. Within North America, New York Air Brake Company, a subsidiary of the German air brake producer Knorr-Bremse AG (“Knorr”) and Amsted Rail Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Amsted Industries Corporation, are our principal overall OEM competitors. Our competition for locomotive, freight and passenger transit service and repair is mostly from the railroads’ and passenger transit authorities’ in-house operations, Electro-Motive Diesel, a division of Caterpillar, GE Transportation Systems, and New York Air Brake/Knorr. We believe our key strengths, which include leading market positions in core products, breadth of product offering with a stable mix of OEM and aftermarket business, leading design and engineering capabilities, significant barriers to entry and an experienced management team, enable us to compete effectively in this marketplace. Outside of North America, no individual company is our principal competitor in all of our operating locations. The largest competitors for Brake and Transit products are Faiveley Transport and Knorr. In addition, our competitors often include smaller, local suppliers in most international markets.

Employees

AtDecember 31, 2015, we had approximately13,000full-time employees, approximately30%of whom were unionized. A majority of the employees subject to collective bargaining agreements are outside North America and these agreements are generally effective from 2016 through 2018. Agreements expiring at various times during 2016 cover approximately26%of the Company’s workforce. We consider our relations with employees and union representatives to be good, but cannot assure that future contract negotiations will be favorable to us.

Regulation

In the course of our operations, we are subject to various regulations of governments and other agencies in the U.S. and around the world. These entities typically govern equipment and safety standards for freight rail and passenger transit rolling stock, oversee a wide variety of rules and regulations governing safety and design of equipment, and evaluate certification and qualification requirements for suppliers.  New products generally must undergo testing and approval processes that are rigorous and lengthy. As a result of these regulations and requirements, we must usually obtain and maintain certifications in a variety of jurisdictions and countries.  The governing bodies include:  FRA and AAR in the U.S., the International Union of Railways (“UIC”) and the European Railway Agency in Europe, the Federal Agency of Railway Transport in Russia, the Agencia Nacional de Transportes Terrestres in Brazil, the National Railway Administration, formerly the Ministry of Railway in China, and the Ministry of Railways in India.

Effects of Seasonality

Our business is not typically seasonal, although the third quarter results may be affected by vacation and scheduled plant shutdowns at several of our major customers during this period.
