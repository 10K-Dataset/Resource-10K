DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS BY SEGMENT

﻿



﻿

We operate primarily through three business segments: diagnostic and information technology-based products and services for the veterinary market, which we refer to as the Companion Animal Group (“CAG”); water quality products (“Water”); and diagnostic productsand servicesfor livestock and poultry health and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food,and improve bovine reproductive efficiency,which we refer to as Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”).Our Other operating segment combines and presents products for the human point-of-care medical diagnostics market (“OPTI Medical”) with our pharmaceutical product line and ourout-licensing arrangements because they do not meet the quantitative or qualitative thresholds for reportable segments.

﻿

The performance of our business is particularly subject to various risks that are associated with doing business internationally. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of products and services to customers outsidethe U.S. accounted forapproximately39 percentof our overall revenue. See “PartI, Item 1A. Risk Factors”, “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”andNote 15 tothe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017,included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information about our segments andrevenue fromcustomers outside of the U.S.

﻿

﻿














﻿

We believe that the breadth of our full diagnostic solution, including novel products and services developed and made available only by IDEXX, as well as the seamless software integration of our offering, comprise a unique competitive advantage, providing veterinarians with the tools and services to offer advanced veterinary medical care.We believe that with the use of our products and services, veterinary practices significantly improve the quality of veterinary care provided to their patients, increase staff efficiencies, and effectively communicate the value of this medical care to the pet owner.We believe that these capabilities, enabled by the use of IDEXX products and services, improve the financial health of theveterinarypractice.

﻿

CAG Diagnostics



We provide diagnostic capabilities that meet veterinarians’ diverse needs through a variety of modalities, including in-clinic diagnostic solutions and outside reference laboratory services. Regardless of modality utilized, veterinarians are provided with clinically relevant data which is integrated within our information management technologies. The result is a comprehensive view of patient diagnostic information that is easily accessible by both the veterinarian and pet owner.

﻿














Integrated Diagnostic Information Management

﻿

VetConnect PLUSis a cloud-based technology that enables veterinarians to access and analyze patients’ data fromall ofIDEXX’s diagnostic modalities. These integrated diagnostic results provide the veterinarian with a visualization of patient-specific testing results, allowing the veterinarian to easily see and trend diagnostic results, enabling greater medical insightand enhanced decision making. In addition, VetConnect PLUS provides instant mobile orbrowser-basedaccess to results, which can be printed or emailed to pet ownersandother veterinarians. In this way, VetConnect PLUS can aid veterinariansand practice staff in engaging the pet owner in the patient’s care, which can support greater compliancewith medicalrecommendations or preventive care protocols.Customers have activated VetConnect PLUS in over 80 countries.

﻿

In-Clinic Diagnostic Solutions

﻿

Our in-clinic diagnostic solutions are comprised of our IDEXX VetLab suite of in-clinic chemistry, hematology, immunoassay, urinalysis, and coagulation analyzers, associated proprietary consumable products that provide real-time reference lab quality diagnostic results and a broad range of single-use, handheld IDEXX SNAPrapid assay test kits that provide quick, accurate, and convenient point-of-care diagnostic test results for a variety of companion animal diseases and health conditions.

﻿

The IDEXX VetLab suite includes several instrument systems, as well as associated proprietary consumable products, all of which are described below.Additionally, we offer extended maintenance agreements in connection with the sale of our instruments.

﻿

Blood and Urine Chemistry.We sell three chemistry analyzers, the Catalyst One Chemistry analyzer, the Catalyst DxChemistry analyzer, and the VetTest chemistry analyzer, that are used by veterinarians to measure levels of certain enzymes and other substances in blood or urine for monitoring health status and assisting in diagnosing physiologic conditions. These three instruments use consumables manufactured for IDEXX by Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Inc. (“Ortho”) based on Ortho’s dry slide technology. In addition, the Catalyst analyzers also use dry slide electrolyte consumables manufactured by OPTI Medical Systems, Inc. (“OPTI Medical”), one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and other slides also manufactured by IDEXX. Blood tests commonly run on these analyzers include glucose, alkaline phosphatase, ALT (alanine aminotransferase), albumin, calcium, creatinine,blood urea nitrogen,total protein, and many others. Tests are sold individually and in prepackaged panels. All three analyzers also run a urine test called urine protein:creatinine ratio, which assists in the detection of renal disease.

﻿

The Catalyst analyzers provide significantly improved throughput, ease of use and test menu relative to the VetTest analyzer (our original chemistry analyzer), including the ability to run

electrolytes, phenobarbital,

fructosamine

and total thyroxine (“

T


”).

Key ease-of-use features include the ability to run a whole blood sample using an on-board centrifuge, the ability to run pre-packaged, multi-slide clips in addition to single chemistry slides and an automated metering system. These analyzers also enable automated dilutions, which is an ease-of-use feature both for certain blood chemistries and the test for urine protein:creatinine ratio. The Catalyst Dx analyzer allows a veterinarian to run multiple patient samples simultaneously and both the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One run different sample types including whole blood, plasma, serum

,

a

nd urine. In addition, the Catalyst Dx and Catalyst One analyzers run a test to measure

phenobarbital levels in blood, allowing veterin

arians to adjust anticonvulsant medication more quickly and efficiently

. Our

fructosamine test helps veterinarians to

diagnose and

manage canine and feline diabetes mellitus, helping to assess insulin treatments

,

and adjust insulin dosages. We

launched our

total T


test

globally for use on the Catalyst One analyzer during the first quarter of 2015 and for use on the Catalyst Dx analyzer early in the third quarter of 2015.

T


testing is essential to assessing and managing thyroid function and is an accepted standard for baseline testing for both sick pets and preventive care in senior pets.

﻿

The Catalyst One analyzer, launched in November 2014, is engineered to deliver the same laboratory-quality results and real-time workflow as the Catalyst Dx analyzer. The Catalyst One analyzer currently offersall the same tests as the Catalyst Dx, plus an expandedmenu of 30 tests, including tests for thyroid disease, kidney disease, diabetes,and therapeutic drug monitoring.

﻿












In January 2018, we launched the Catalyst SDMA Test in North America, which allows our customers to use the Catalyst One and Catalyst Dx to screen for SDMA. We expect to launch our Catalyst SDMA Test outside of North America in 2018as well.

﻿

We also havetwo other chemistry analyzers, the VetLyte Electrolyteanalyzerand the VetStat Electrolyte and Blood Gasanalyzer. The VetStat analyzer runs single-use disposable cassettes that are manufactured by OPTI Medical.

﻿

Sales of consumables to customers who use our chemistry analyzers provide the majority of our instrument consumables revenues from our installed base of IDEXX VetLab instruments.

﻿

Hematology. We sell four hematology analyzers that assess the cellular components of blood, including red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets (also called a complete blood count). These analyzers include the ProCyte Dxhematologyanalyzer, the first and only in-house analyzer to combine laser-flow cytometry, optical fluorescence,and laminar-flow impedance in its analysis; the original LaserCytehematologyanalyzerandthe latestgeneration LaserCyte Dxhematologyanalyzer, launched in 2013, which both use laser-flow cytometry technology in their analysis; and the IDEXX VetAutoreadhematologyanalyzer, our original hematology analyzer. In addition, the ProCyte Dxhematologyanalyzer, the LaserCyte Dxhematologyanalyzer,and the LaserCytehematologyanalyzereach have the ability to analyze the components of certain body fluids. We also sell the Coag Dxanalyzer, which permits the detection and diagnosis of blood clotting disorders.

﻿

The ProCyte Dxanalyzer,our premier hematology analyzer, provides significantly improved throughput and accuracy and more complete medical information relative to the LaserCyte, LaserCyte Dx and VetAutoread hematology analyzers. The ProCyte Dx analyzer provides up to 26 different blood parameters, including the ability to detect band neutrophils and nucleated red blood cells, for a more complete picture of a patient’s health. The ProCyte Dx is validated formanyanimal species (canine, feline, equine, bovine, ferret, rabbit, gerbil, pig, guinea pig,mini pig, llama, alpaca, camel, sheep, goat, dolphin, and hamster) with research and development efforts focused on validating results for additional species.

﻿

Immunoassay Testing Instruments.During the first quarter of 2014, we launched the SNAP ProMobile Device, which automatically activates a SNAP test, properly times the run,and captures an image of the result. This device improves medical care by allowing veterinarians to share the test results on the SNAP Pro Mobile screen, or via VetConnect PLUS. Inaddition, the SNAP Pro Mobile Device improves staff efficiencyand ensures that all SNAP test runs are captured and entered into the patient record for customer billing.InJanuary 2017, we launched ProRead for the SNAP ProMobile Device. ProRead is a software upgrade that enables the SNAP ProMobile Device to interpret the test results.

﻿

With multiple-patient testing functionality, the SNAPshot Dxanalyzerprovides quantitative measurements of total T4, cortisol and bile acids to assist in the evaluation of thyroid, adrenal and liver function,respectively. The SNAPshot Dx analyzeralso reads, interprets,and records the results of many IDEXX rapid assay SNAP tests, including our canine SNAP4Dx Plus test,feline SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo test, canineSNAPcPLtest, felineSNAPfPLtest, SNAP Feline Triple testandcanineSNAPHeartworm RT test.

﻿

Urinalysis.In April2016, we launchedtheSediVue Dxurine sediment analyzerin North America. In the fourth quarter of 2016 we launched Sedivue Dx in the UK and Australia.During the first half of 2017, we continued our international launch of SediVue Dx to include other parts of Europe and New Zealand. We plan to continue our international deployment in 2018 to include Switzerland, Poland, and Japan.SediVue Dx is the firstand onlyveterinaryin-clinic urine sediment analyzer. It isdesigned to provide automated real-time results in a fraction of the time of manual microscope analysis.SediVue Dx brings automation, speed and consistency to urinalysis, a traditionally laborious and variable process. Its leading-edge technology allows veterinary staff to perform a complete urinalysis inapproximately3 minutes. SediVue Dx uses proprietary image processing algorithms similar to facial recognition technology to identify clinicallyrelevant particles found in urine and to capture high-contrast digital images that become part of the permanent patient record.The IDEXX VetLab UAanalyzerprovides rapid,automated capture ofsemi-quantitative chemical urinalysis and is validated specifically for veterinary use.












﻿

IDEXX VetLab Station. The IDEXX VetLab Station (“IVLS”) connects and integrates the diagnostic information from all the IDEXX VetLab analyzers and thus provides reference laboratory information management system capability.IVLS securely connects to the internet, and in this way,enables IDEXX to perform, throughitsSmartService Solutionswireless services, remoteinstrument service and softwareupdates to IVLS and certain connected instruments. IVLS also sends all results created on connected instruments instantly to VetConnect PLUS. We sell IVLS as an integral component of the Catalyst One,Catalyst Dx,LaserCyte Dx andProCyte Dxanalyzers, SNAP Pro Mobile Device, SNAPshot Dx analyzerand also as a standalone hardware platform. The IVLS includes a touch screen user interface to simplify laboratory work flow, connect with a practice management system and send information to run the individual analyzers. IVLS also generates one integrated patient report incorporating all of the lab work generated by the IDEXX VetLab suite, stores, retrieves and analyzes historical patient diagnostics data, including SNAP test results, and sends and receives information from practice management systems, including the IDEXX Cornerstone system, as well as a wide variety of third-party systems.

﻿

The SNAPrapid assaysare single-use, handheld test kits that can work without the use of instrumentation, although many kits may also be read and recorded automatically by the SNAPshot Dx analyzeror activated and captured automatically by the SNAP Pro Mobile Deviceand interpreted using ProRead,as discussed above. The principal SNAP rapid assay tests are as follows:

﻿

Single-Use Canine Tests:

·SNAP 4Dx Plus, whichtests for the six vector-borne diseases;Lyme disease,Ehrlichia canis, Ehrlichia ewingii, Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys,andcanine heartworm;

·SNAP Heartworm RT, which tests forheartworm;

·SNAP Parvo, which tests for parvovirus, a virus causing life-threatening damage to the immune system and intestinal tract;

·SNAP cPL, which tests for canine pancreatitis;

·SNAPGiardia, which is a fecal test for solubleGiardiaantigens, a common cause of waterborne infection; and

·SNAP Lepto, which tests for leptospirosis, a life-threatening bacterial infection spread through contact with water or soil that has been contaminated by the urine of infected animals.

Sales of canine vector-borne disease tests, including SNAP 4Dx Plusand SNAP Heartworm RT, are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practicein the Northern Hemisphere.

﻿

Single-Use Feline Tests:

·SNAP Feline Triple, which tests for feline immunodeficiency virus (“FIV”) (which is similar to the virus that leads to AIDS in humans), feline leukemia virus (“FeLV”) and feline heartworm;

·SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Test, which tests for FIV and FeLV;

·SNAP fPL, which tests for feline pancreatitis;

·SNAPGiardia, which is a fecal test for solubleGiardiaantigens; and

·SNAP Feline proBNP, which uses a cardiac biomarker (NT proBNP) to test for stretch and stress on the heart.














OutsideReference Laboratory Diagnostic and Consulting Services

﻿

We offer commercial reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services to veterinarians worldwide, including customers in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan,New Zealand, South Africa,South Korea, and Brazil. We have reference laboratories in Memphis, Tennessee andLeipzig, Germany that are strategically located near largelogisticshubsof major air cargo carriers. Customers use our services by submitting samples by courier or overnight delivery to one of our facilities. Most test results have same-day or next-day turnaround times. Our reference laboratories offer a large selection of tests and diagnostic panels to detect a number of disease states and other conditions in animals, including all tests that can be run in-clinic at the veterinary practice with our instruments or rapid assays.This menu of tests also includes a number of specialized and proprietary tests that we have developed that allow practitioners to diagnose increasingly relevantdiseases andconditions in dogs and cats, includingparasites,heart disease, allergies, pancreatitis, diabetes,and infectious diseases.Canine vector-borne disease testing volumes are greater in the first half of our fiscal year due to seasonality of disease testing in the veterinary practicein the Northern Hemisphere.

﻿

Inthe third quarter of2015, welaunched the IDEXX SDMA test in North America, anew proprietary kidney test which detects the onset of canine and feline kidney disease months or years earlier than traditional methods. Upon its introduction in North America, the IDEXX SDMA testwasincluded in everychemistry panelsubmitted by our customersat no incremental charge. During thefirst quarter of 2016, we launched the IDEXX SDMA test in all of the major European countries and Australia, followed by a full international launch of the IDEXX SDMA test during the remainder of 2016.

﻿

In the second quarter of 2015, we launchedHookworm and Roundworm antigen teststo all fecal panels that already include the Whipworm antigen test. These new intestinal parasite panels detect the presence of intestinal worms left undiagnosed by current methods, finding them earlier in the infection cycle and therefore enabling earlier disease diagnosis and treatment intervention.

﻿

Additionally, we provide specialized veterinary consultation, telemedicine,and advisory services, including radiology, cardiology, internal medicine,and ultrasound consulting. These services enable veterinarians to obtain readings and interpretations of test results transmitted by telephone and over the internet.

Veterinary Software, Services and Diagnostic Imaging Systems

﻿

Veterinary Software and Services.We develop, market and sell practice management systems, including hardware, software and services that run key functions of veterinary clinics, including managing patient electronic health records, scheduling (including for boarding and grooming), client communication, billing,and inventory management. Our principal practice management systems are Cornerstone, DVMAX, Animana andIDEXXNeo. IDEXX Neo, which we launched in the United States during the third quarter of 2015, and IDEXX Animana are cloud-based practice management systems available in the U.S., Europe,and Australia. We also support several other practice management systems installed with our customers, including Better Choice, VPM, VetLINK andBeeFree. Our practice management services include Payment Solutions, Data Backup & Recovery and PetDetect boarding collars.

﻿

In addition, we offer client communication and preventive care plan management services designed to strengthen the relationship between the veterinarian and the pet owner. We commercially launched Pet Health Network Pro in 2013, which is a subscription-based service that permits veterinarians to provide online communication and education to pet owners before, during and after each patient visit, thus strengthening the loyalty between a practice and its clients. Further, veterinarians can share VetConnect PLUS testing results directly with pet owners via Pet Health Network Pro. We also offer Pet Health Network 3D, an educational subscription-based service that replaces cumbersome plastic anatomy models with engaging, three-dimension anatomical animations on a desktop or mobile device. In September 2014, we acquired Petly Plans, a cloud-based software solution for veterinary practices to customize, manage and monitor a range of monthly payment preventive care plans for their pet owner clients. Petly Plans complements the Pet Health Network suite of client marketing services by making it easier for practices to increase access to the best care and offer plans that spread the cost of that care, including










examinations, vaccines,and diagnostics, over the course of the year. Certain of our services are compatible with non-IDEXX practice management systems.

﻿

With our acquisition of rVetLink in June 2017, wenowalso offer a comprehensive referral management solution for specialty care hospitals that streamlines the referral process between primary care and specialty care veterinarians. General practice veterinarians occasionally refer patients to board-certified specialists for advanced care in areas such as cardiology, oncology, dermatology, ophthalmology, surgery, or internal medicine. rVetLink automates the time-consuming process of sharing medical records and images, and sending notifications to facilitate generalist-specialist collaboration in the delivery of care. rVetLink’s cloud technology integrates withour othermajor specialty hospital management systems, including IDEXX Cornerstone Software and IDEXX DVMAX Software.

﻿

DiagnosticImaging Systems.Our diagnosticimaging systems capture radiographic images in digital form, replacing traditional x-ray film and the film development process, which generally requires the use of hazardous chemicals and darkrooms. We market and sell three diagnosticimaging systemsprimarily used in small animal veterinary applications:theIDEXXImageVue DR50, the IDEXX ImageVue DR40 and theIDEXXImageVue CR20.

﻿

Our newest radiography system, the IDEXX ImageVue DR50, was launched in June 2016 and enables low-dose radiation image capture without sacrificing clear, high-quality images, a component in reducing the risk posed by excess radiation exposure for veterinary professionals. The IDEXX ImageVue DR50 system also offers wireless capabilities for flexibility in patient positioning.

﻿

Our diagnosticimaging systems employ picture archiving and communication system (“PACS”) software called IDEXX-PACS, which facilitates radiographic image capture and review. IDEXX Web PACS is our cloud-based software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) offering for viewing, accessing, storing, and sharing multi-modality diagnostic images. IDEXX Web PACS is integrated with Cornerstone, IDEXX Neo and IDEXXVetConnectPLUSto provide centralized access to diagnostic imaging resultsalongside patient diagnostic results fromany internet connected device.IDEXX Web PACS updates automatically and offers secure storage for an unlimited number of diagnostic images. The new software features advanced radiology measurement tools as well as an interactive collaboration feature that allows veterinarians to collaborate and consult remotely with other practitioners.

﻿

IDEXX I-Vision Mobile is a software application that allows veterinarians withIDEXX digital radiography systems the abilityto request, view and send images using an iPad®or an Android™mobile tablet. This application integrates with our IDEXX-PACS software.

﻿
















﻿

Our principal products arethe Colilert, Colilert-18and Colisure tests, which simultaneously detect the presence of total coliforms andE. coliin water. These organisms are broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. These products utilize nutrient-indicators that produce a change in color or fluorescence when metabolized by target microbes in the sample. Our water tests are used by government laboratories, water utilities and private certified laboratories to test drinking water in compliance with regulatory standards, including U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) standards. The tests also are used in evaluating water used in production processes (for example, in beverage and pharmaceutical applications) and in evaluating bottled water, recreational water, wastewater,and water from private wells.

﻿

Our Enterolert products detect the presence ofenterococciin drinking, waste,and recreational waters. Enterococci, bacteria normally found in human and animal waste, are organisms broadly used as microbial indicators for potential fecal contamination in water. Our Pseudalert products detect the presence ofPseudomonas aeruginosain pool, spa,and bottled water.Pseudomonas aeruginosais a pathogen that can cause “hot-tub rash,” “swimmer’s ear” and potentially fatal infections in individuals with weakened immune systems.Our Filta-Max and Filta-Maxxpressproducts are used in the detection ofCryptosporidiumandGiardiain water.CryptosporidiumandGiardiaare parasites that can cause potentially fatal gastrointestinal illness if ingested. We alsodistribute certain water testing kits manufacturedby Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.that complement ourCryptosporidiumandGiardiatesting products.














﻿

In July 2016, we launched Legiolert, a simple culture method test for the detection ofLegionella pneumophila,the most commonLegionellaspecies in water and the primary cause of Legionnaires’ disease. The Legiolert test is designed to be used on potable or non-potable water sources with results in seven days.

﻿

Our Quanti-Tray products, when used in conjunction with our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Enterolert, Pseudalert or Heterotrophic Plate Count (HPC) products, provide users quantitative measurements of microbial contamination rather than a presence/absence indication. In the second quarter of 2015, we launched the Quanti-Tray Sealer PLUS, a next generation instrument of the previously available Quanti-Tray Sealer 2X. These instruments are used with the Quanti-Tray products for the determination of bacterial density in water samples. Our SimPlate for HPC product detects the total number of the most common bacteria in a water sample.

﻿

We also sell consumables, parts,and accessories to be used with many of our water testing products.

﻿


















﻿

We sell diagnostic tests, servicesand related instrumentation that are used to manage the health status of livestock and poultry, to improve bovine reproductive efficiency, and to ensure the quality and safety of milk and food. Our livestock and poultry diagnostic products are purchased by government and private laboratories that provide testing services tolivestockveterinarians, producers,and processors.Our herd health screening services are offered to livestock veterinarians and producers.Our principal livestock and poultry diagnostic products include tests for Bovine Viral Diarrhea Virus (“BVDV”) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (“PRRS”). BVDV is a common and contagious viral infection that suppresses the immune system, making the animal susceptible to a host of other infections, impacting beef and dairy production yields as a result. PRRS is a contagious virus causing reproductive problems and respiratory diseases in swine, leading to increased piglet mortality, reduced growth, and vulnerability to secondary infections.

﻿

Our principal dairy products use our SNAP test format and are used by dairy producers and processors worldwide to detect antibiotic drug residue in milk. Our primary product lines are SNAP Beta-Lactam ST and SNAPduo Beta-Tetra ST, which detect certain beta lactam and tetracycline antibiotic residues. We also sell SNAPtests for the detection of certain other contaminants in milk, such as Aflatoxin M1.

﻿

In June 2016, we launched the Rapid Visual Pregnancy Test for cattle, which is a point-of-care test that can detect pregnancy 28 days after breeding. This test provides a quick and accurate identifier using whole blood samples that will enable veterinarians to optimize value-added medical consulting services while on farm visits.

﻿

While we consider these proprietary technology rights to be important to us

, a range of factors help to mitigate the future effects of patent and license expiration on our results of operations and financial position. These factors include

our brand strength

and reputation in the marketplace; the breadth, quality and integration of our product offerings; our existing customer relationships and our customer support; our sales force;

our online ordering platform that enables direct ordering of (including establishing automatic reorder schedules for) our consumables, tests and other products by our customers;

the applicable regulatory approval status for certain products; our continued investments in innovative product improvements that often result in new technologies and/or additional patents;

our investment in diagnostic innovations that results in new product offerings that often are patentable and that expand the test menu for our in-house instruments and/or reference laboratory business;



our

significant know-how, scale and investments related to manufacturing processes of associated product offerings and certain supply arrangements for consumables that are compatible with our instruments.

Although we have several patents and licenses of patents and technologies from third parties that expired during 2017, and are expected to expire in 2018 and beyond,

the expiration of these patents

, individually or in the aggregate, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company’s financial position or future operations.

In addition

, we already face notable competition in certain areas as other companies have been successful in bringing competitive products to market, despite the protections afforded by these proprietary technology rights

.

﻿

To the extent some of our products may now,or in the future,embody technologies protected by patents, copyrights,or trade secrets of others, we may be required to obtain licenses to such technologies in order to continue to sell our products. These licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our failure to obtain anysuch licenses may delay or prevent the sale of certain new or existing products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

﻿

VetTest and Catalyst chemistry slides are supplied by Ortho under supply agreements that are currently set to expire at the end of 2028. We are required to purchase all of our requirements for our current menu of VetTestandCatalystchemistry slides from Ortho to the extent Ortho is able to supply thoserequirements. The agreements provide for pricing based on purchase volumes and a fixed annual inflationary adjustment. The agreements also prohibit Ortho from promoting and selling these chemistry slides in the veterinary market, excluding the EU, other than to IDEXX.

﻿

We purchase other analyzers and consumables under supply agreements with terms extending through 2032, which in some cases may be extended at our option. We have minimum purchase obligations under some of these agreements, and our failure to satisfy these obligations may result in loss of some or all of our rights under these agreements. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

﻿

Other components. We purchase certain other products, raw materials,and components from sole and single source suppliers. Theseproducts include certain diagnosticimagingsystems and certain components used in our SNAP rapid assay and dairy devices, livestock,and poultry testing kits and water testing products.

﻿

Certain components incorporated into our SNAP products and certain livestock and poultry testing kits are supplied by Moss, Inc. (“Moss”) under a supply agreement that either party may terminate with 24 months prior written notice. Pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement, Moss has escrowed its manufacturing information relating to the components, which may be released to us upon certain triggering events that would render Moss incapable of supplying the components to us. If such a triggering event occurs, we will make royalty payments to Moss for the use of such information until Moss is able to again begin manufacturing.

﻿

We have been successful in ensuring an uninterrupted supply of products purchased from sole and single source suppliers. However, there can be no assurance that uninterrupted supply can be maintained if these agreements terminate for any reason or our suppliers otherwise are unable to satisfy our requirements for products. See “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

BACKLOG

﻿

We do not generally maintain significant backlogordersand believe that our backlog at any particular date historically has not been indicative of future sales.

﻿














GOVERNMENT REGULATION

﻿

Many of our products are subject to comprehensive regulation by U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies that relate to, among other things, product approvals,registrations,manufacturing,import, export,distribution, marketing and promotion, labeling, recordkeeping, testing, quality, storage,and product disposal. The following is a description of the principal regulations affecting our businesses.

﻿

Veterinary diagnostic products

. Diagnostic tests for animal health infectious diseases, including most of our livestock and poultry products and our rapid assay products, are regulated in the U.S. by the Center for Veterinary Biologics within the United States Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (“APHIS”). These products must be approved by APHIS before they may be sold in the U.S. The APHIS regulatory approval process involves the submission of product performance data and manufacturing documentation. Following regulatory approval to market a product, APHIS requires that each lot of product be submitted for review before release to customers. In addition, APHIS requires special approval to market products where test results are used in part for government-mandated disease management programs. A number of foreign governments accept APHIS



approval

, including for the purpose of obtaining product registration,

as part of their separate regulatory approvals. However, compliance with an extensive regulatory process is required in connection with

importing and

marketing diagnostic products in Japan, Germany,

Canada, Brazil,

the Netherlands

,

and many other countries. We

are also

required to have a facility license from APHIS to manufacture USDA-licensed products. We have a facility license for our manufacturing facility in Westbrook, Maine and our distribution center in Memphis, Tennessee. Our

LPD

manufacturing facility in Montpellier, France has been approved by APHIS and we have a permit to import products manufactured in Montpellier, France to the U.S. for distribution.

﻿

Our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are veterinary medical devices regulated bytheFDAunder the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (the “FDC Act”). While the sale of these products does not require premarket approval by the FDA and does not subject us to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”), these products must not be adulterated, mislabeled,or misbranded under the FDC Act.

﻿

In the EU, our veterinary diagnostic instrument systems are not subject to regulation under the European Medical Device Directive or the In Vitro Diagnostic Directive, which are both strictly applicable to human use products. However, these systems are subject to the requirements of the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive, which applies to all electronic or electrical products capable of causing or being disturbed by electromagnetic interference and requires European Conformity marking on our analyzers. In addition, we anticipate our analyzers will be subject to the requirements of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive, or RoHS, which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment, beginning in July 2019.

﻿

Water testing products. Our water tests are not subject to formal premarket regulatory approval. However, before a test can be used as part of a water quality monitoring program in the U.S. that is regulated by the EPA, the test must first be approved by the EPA. The EPA approval process involves submission of extensive product performance data in accordance with an EPA-approved protocol, evaluation of the data by the EPA and publication for public comment of any proposed approval in the Federal Register before final approval. Our Colilert, Colilert-18, Colisure, Quanti-Tray, Filta-Maxxpress, Enterolert and SimPlate for heterotrophic plate counts products have been approved by the EPA for use under various regulatory programs. Water testing products are subject to similarly extensive regulatory processes in other countries around the world.



Dairy testing products. Dairy products used in National Conference on Interstate Milk Shipments (“NCIMS”) milk-monitoring programs in the U.S. are regulated by the FDA as veterinary medical devices. However, before products requiring FDA approval can be sold in the U.S., performance data must be submitted in accordance with an FDA-approved protocol administered by an independent body, such as the Association of Analytical Communities Research Institute (“AOAC RI”). Following approval of a product by the FDA, the product must also be approved by NCIMS, an oversight body that includes state, federal and industry representatives. Our SNAP Beta-Lactam antibiotic residue test product has been approved by the FDA, NCIMS and AOAC RI for sale in the U.S. While some foreign countries accept AOAC RI approval as part of their regulatory approval process, many countries have separate regulatory processes.












Human point-of-care electrolyte and blood gas analyzers. Our OPTI instrument systems are classified asClass I and/orClass II medical devices, and their design, manufacture and marketing are regulated by the FDA. Accordingly, we must comply with cGMP in the manufacture of our OPTI products.The FDA’s Quality System regulations further set forth standards for product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. NewOPTIproducts fall into FDA classifications that require notification of and review by the FDA before marketing, and which are submitted as a 510(k) application.OPTI Medicalproducts are also subject to the European Medical Device Directives and regulations governing the manufacture and marketing of medical devices in other countries in which they are sold.

﻿

The European Union regulates and restricts the use of certain substances that we currently use in our products or processes. These requirements include the Biocidal Products Regulation, which may require the use of approved biocides in our products prior to being used orsold in the European Union,the European Regulation for Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances, or REACH, which regulates and restricts the use of certain chemicals in the European Union, and the Restriction of Hazardous Substance or RoHS which regulates and restricts certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment. Compliance with these regulations (and similar regulations that may be adopted elsewhere) may require registration of the applicable substances or the redesign or reformulation of our products.

﻿

In addition to the foregoing, our business is generally subject to various U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) and other anti-competition authorities, andwe are also subject to anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, import and export laws and regulations, including U.S. import and export control and sanctions laws and laws and regulations governing the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of data. Any acquisitions of new products and technologies may subject us to additional areas of government regulation. These may involve, medical device, water-quality and other regulations of theFDA, the EPA, the USDA, the FTC,and other federal agencies, as well as state, local and foreign governments. See “Part I, Item 1A. RiskFactors.”
