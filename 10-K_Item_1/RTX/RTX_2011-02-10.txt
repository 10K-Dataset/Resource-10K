Item 1.Business

General

United Technologies Corporation was incorporated in Delaware in 1934. UTC provides high technology products and services to the building systems
and aerospace industries worldwide. Growth is attributable to the internal development of our existing businesses and to acquisitions. The following description of our business should be read in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2010 Annual Report, especially the information contained therein under the heading “Business Overview.”

Our operating units include businesses with operations throughout the world. Otis, Carrier and UTC Fire & Security (collectively referred
to as the commercial businesses) serve customers in the commercial and residential property industries worldwide. Carrier also serves commercial, industrial, transport refrigeration and food service equipment customers. Pratt & Whitney,
Hamilton Sundstrand and Sikorsky (collectively referred to as the aerospace businesses) primarily serve commercial and government customers in both the original equipment and aftermarket parts and services markets of the aerospace industry. Hamilton
Sundstrand, Pratt & Whitney and UTC Fire & Security also serve customers in certain industrial markets. For 2010, our commercial and industrial sales (generated principally by our commercial businesses) were approximately 57
percent of our consolidated net sales, and commercial aerospace and military aerospace sales were approximately 22 percent and 21 percent, respectively, of our consolidated net sales. Sales for 2010 from outside the United States, including U.S.
export sales, were 60 percent of our total segment sales.

Segment financial data for the years 2008 through 2010, including financial information about foreign and domestic operations and export sales,
appears in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Annual Report. Segment sales as discussed below include intercompany sales, which are ultimately eliminated within the “Eliminations and other” category as reflected
in the segment financial data in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Annual Report. Similarly, total segment backlog as discussed below includes intercompany backlog.

Otis

Otis is the world’s largest elevator and escalator manufacturing, installation and
service company. Otis designs, manufactures, sells and installs a wide range of passenger and freight elevators for low-, medium- and high-speed applications, as well as a broad line of escalators and moving walkways. In addition to new equipment,
Otis provides modernization products to upgrade elevators and escalators as well as maintenance and repair services for both its products and those of other manufacturers. Otis serves customers in the commercial and residential property industries
around the world. Otis sells directly to the end customer and, to a limited extent, through sales representatives and distributors.

Sales generated by Otis’ international operations were 82 percent and 80 percent of total Otis segment sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively.
At December 31, 2010, Otis’ backlog was $13,923 million as compared to $14,550 million at December 31, 2009. Of the total Otis backlog at December 31, 2010, approximately $7,874 million is expected to be realized as sales in
2011.

Carrier

Sales generated by Carrier’s international operations, including U.S. export
sales, were 56 percent and 55 percent of total Carrier segment sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, Carrier’s backlog was $2,240 million as compared to $2,199 million at December 31, 2009. Substantially all of
the backlog at December 31, 2010 is expected to be realized as sales in 2011.

UTC Fire & Security

UTC Fire & Security is a global provider of security and fire safety products and services. UTC Fire & Security provides
electronic security products such as intruder alarms, access control systems and video surveillance systems and designs and manufactures a wide range of fire safety products including specialty hazard detection and fixed suppression products,
portable fire extinguishers, fire detection and life safety systems, and other firefighting equipment. Services provided to the electronic security and fire safety industries include systems integration, video surveillance, installation, maintenance
and inspection services. UTC Fire & Security also provides monitoring, response and security personnel services, including cash-in-transit security, to complement its electronic security and fire safety businesses. In 2010, we completed the
acquisition of the GE Security business from General Electric Company. With the acquisition of GE Security, UTC strengthened its portfolio of security and fire safety technologies for commercial and residential applications, including fire detection
and life safety systems, intrusion alarms, video surveillance and







access control systems, and also significantly enhanced UTC Fire & Security’s North American presence. UTC Fire & Security products and services are used by governments,
financial institutions, architects, building owners and developers, security and fire consultants and other end-users requiring a high level of security and fire protection for their businesses and residences. UTC Fire & Security provides
its products and services under Chubb, Kidde and other brand names and sells directly to the customer as well as through manufacturer representatives, distributors, dealers and U.S. retail distribution.

Sales generated by UTC Fire & Security’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 84 percent and 82 percent of
total UTC Fire & Security segment sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, UTC Fire & Security’s backlog was $1,106 million as compared to $898 million at December 31, 2009. Most of the backlog at
December 31, 2010 is expected to be realized as sales in 2011.

Pratt & Whitney

Pratt & Whitney is among the world’s leading suppliers of aircraft engines for the commercial, military, business jet and general
aviation markets. Pratt & Whitney Global Services provides maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts, as well as fleet management services for large commercial engines. Pratt & Whitney produces
families of engines for wide- and narrow-body aircraft in the commercial and military markets. Pratt & Whitney Power Systems sells aero-derivative engines for industrial applications. Pratt & Whitney Canada (P&WC) is a world
leader in the production of engines powering business, regional, light jet, utility and military aircraft and helicopters and provides related maintenance, repair and overhaul services, including the sale of spare parts, as well as fleet management
services. Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) is a leader in the design, development and manufacture of sophisticated space propulsion systems for military and commercial applications, including the U.S. space shuttle program.

In view of the risks and costs associated with developing new engines, Pratt & Whitney has entered into collaboration arrangements in
which sales, costs and risks are shared. At December 31, 2010, the interests of third party participants in Pratt & Whitney-directed commercial jet engine programs ranged from 14 percent to 48 percent. In addition, Pratt &
Whitney has interests in other engine programs, including a 33 percent interest in the International Aero Engines (IAE) collaboration, which sells and supports V2500 engines for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft. At December 31, 2010, portions
of Pratt & Whitney’s interests in IAE (equivalent to 4 percent of the overall IAE collaboration) were held by third party participants. Pratt & Whitney also has a 50 percent interest in the Engine Alliance (EA), a joint
venture with GE Aviation, which markets and manufactures the GP7000 engine for the Airbus A380 aircraft. At December 31, 2010, 40 percent of Pratt & Whitney’s 50 percent interest in the EA was held by third party participants.
Pratt & Whitney continues to pursue additional collaboration partners.







Pratt & Whitney’s products are sold principally to aircraft manufacturers, airlines and
other aircraft operators, aircraft leasing companies, space launch vehicle providers and the U.S. and foreign governments. Pratt & Whitney’s products and services must adhere to strict regulatory and market-driven safety and
performance standards. The frequently changing nature of these standards, along with the long duration of aircraft engine development, production and support programs, creates uncertainty regarding engine program profitability. The vast majority of
sales are made directly to the end customer and, to a limited extent, through independent distributors and foreign sales representatives. Sales to Airbus were 12 percent and 11 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in 2010 and
2009, respectively, before taking into account discounts or financial incentives offered to customers. Sales to the U.S. government were 32 percent of total Pratt & Whitney segment sales in each of 2010 and 2009.

Sales generated by Pratt & Whitney’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 52 percent of total Pratt &
Whitney segment sales in each of 2010 and 2009. At December 31, 2010, Pratt & Whitney’s backlog was $23,533 million, including $5,059 million of U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2009, these
amounts were $22,614 million and $4,577 million, respectively. Of the total Pratt & Whitney backlog at December 31, 2010, approximately $7,065 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2011. Pratt & Whitney’s backlog
includes certain contracts for which actual costs may ultimately exceed total sales. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Annual Report for a description of our accounting for long-term contracts.

Hamilton Sundstrand

Hamilton Sundstrand is
among the world’s leading suppliers of technologically advanced aerospace and industrial products and aftermarket services for diversified industries worldwide. Hamilton Sundstrand’s aerospace products, such as power generation, management
and distribution systems, flight control systems, engine control systems, environmental control systems, fire protection and detection systems, auxiliary power units and propeller systems, serve commercial, military, regional, business and general

products to airframe manufacturers, the U.S. and foreign governments, aircraft operators and independent distributors. Sales to the U.S. government were 24 percent and 26 percent of total Hamilton Sundstrand segment sales in 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

Hamilton Sundstrand is engaged in development programs for the Boeing 787 aircraft, the Bombardier CSeries aircraft, the
Mitsubishi Regional Jet, the Airbus A350 aircraft, the Irkut MC-21 aircraft, the COMAC C919 aircraft, the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II military aircraft and the Airbus A400M military aircraft. Hamilton Sundstrand is also the operations support
prime contractor for NASA’s space suit/life support system and produces environmental monitoring and control, life support, mechanical systems and thermal control systems for the U.S. space shuttle program, the international space station and
the Orion crew exploration vehicle.

Hamilton Sundstrand’s principal industrial products, such as air compressors, metering pumps
and fluid handling equipment, serve industries involved with chemical and hydrocarbon processing, oil and gas production, water and wastewater treatment and construction. Hamilton Sundstrand sells these products under the Sullair, Sundyne, Milton
Roy and other brand names directly to end users, and through manufacturer representatives and distributors.

Sales generated by Hamilton
Sundstrand’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 49 percent and 50 percent of total Hamilton Sundstrand segment sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, Hamilton Sundstrand’s backlog was
$5,119 million, including $719 million of U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2009, these amounts were $5,077 million and $835 million, respectively. Of the total Hamilton Sundstrand backlog at December 31,
2010, approximately $2,496 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2011.

Sikorsky

Sikorsky is the world’s largest helicopter company. Sikorsky manufactures military and commercial helicopters and also provides aftermarket
helicopter and aircraft parts and services.

Current major production programs at Sikorsky include the UH-60M Black Hawk
medium-transport helicopters and HH-60M Medevac helicopters for the U.S. and foreign governments, the S-70 Black Hawk for foreign governments, the MH-60S and MH-60R helicopters for the U.S. Navy, the International Naval Hawk for multiple naval
missions, and the S-76 and S-92 helicopters for commercial operations. The UH-60M helicopter is the latest and most modern in a series of Black Hawk variants that Sikorsky has been delivering to the U.S. Army since 1978 and requires significant
additional assembly hours relative to the previous variants. In December 2007, the U.S. government and Sikorsky signed a five-year multi-service contract for 537 H-60 helicopters to be delivered to the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy, which include the
UH-60M, HH-60M, MH-60S and MH-60R. The contract includes options for an additional 263 aircraft, spare parts, and kits, potentially making it the largest contract in UTC and Sikorsky history. Actual production quantities will be determined
year-by-year over the life of the program based on funding allocations set by Congress and Pentagon acquisition priorities. The deliveries of the aircraft are scheduled to be made through 2012. Sikorsky is also developing the CH-53K







next generation heavy lift helicopter for the U.S. Marine Corps and the CH-148 derivative of the H-92 helicopter, a military variant of the S-92 helicopter, for the Canadian government. The
latter is being developed under a fixed-price contract that provides for the development, production, and 24-year logistical support of 28 helicopters. This is the largest and most expansive fixed-price development contract in Sikorsky’s
history. As previously disclosed, in June 2010 Sikorsky and the Canadian government signed contract amendments that revised the delivery schedule and contract specifications, and established the requirements for the first six interim aircraft
deliveries to enable initial operational test and evaluation activities prior to the scheduled delivery of final configuration helicopters starting in June 2012. The amendments also included modifications to the liquidated damages schedule,
readjustment of payment schedules, resolution of open disputes and other program enhancements. Delivery of the interim configuration helicopters was scheduled to commence in November 2010, but is now expected to begin in the first quarter of 2011.

Sikorsky’s aftermarket business includes spare parts sales, overhaul and repair services, maintenance contracts and logistics
support programs for helicopters and other aircraft. Sales are principally made to the U.S. and foreign governments, and commercial helicopter operators. Sikorsky is increasingly engaging in logistics support programs and partnering with its
government and commercial customers to manage and provide logistics, maintenance and repair services.

Sales to the U.S. government were
68 percent and 63 percent of total Sikorsky segment sales in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Sales generated by Sikorsky’s international operations, including U.S. export sales, were 33 percent and 32 percent of total Sikorsky segment sales in
2010 and 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2010, Sikorsky’s backlog was $9,287 million, including $4,234 million of U.S. government-funded contracts and subcontracts. At December 31, 2009, these amounts were $10,329 million and
$4,957 million, respectively. Of the total Sikorsky backlog at December 31, 2010, approximately $5,421 million is expected to be realized as sales in 2011.

Other

UTC Power is a world leader in the application of fuel cell technology for stationary
and transportation applications. UTC Power has delivered more than 280 of its 200kW phosphoric acid fuel cell power plants for stationary installations since 1992. UTC Power ceased production of the 200kW unit in 2009 and began deliveries of its
400kW phosphoric acid fuel cell. This new fuel cell is expected to have greater durability than any other large stationary fuel cell currently available in the market. UTC Power’s automotive and bus transportation fuel cell power plants are
based on proton exchange membrane (PEM) technology. PureMotion 120 power plants are currently used in revenue service in transit bus applications in Connecticut, California and Europe. UTC Power is currently developing PEM fuel cells for submarine
applications. In addition, UTC Power is the maker of alkaline-based fuel cells used to provide electricity and drinking water to the U.S. space shuttle.

Although fuel cells are generally believed to be superior to conventional power generation technologies in terms of total system efficiency and environmental characteristics, the technology is still in either early
commercialization or the development stage. Continued technology advancement and cost reduction are required to achieve wide-scale market acceptance. Government support is needed to fully commercialize fuel cell technology. There is still
significant uncertainty as to whether and when commercially viable fuel cells will be produced.

In January 2010, we acquired a 49.5%
equity stake in Clipper Windpower Plc (Clipper), a California-based wind turbine manufacturer. In December 2010, we completed the acquisition of all of the remaining shares of Clipper. This investment is intended to expand our power generation
portfolio and allow us to enter the wind power market by leveraging our expertise in blade technology, turbines and gearbox design.

The
results of UTC Power and Clipper are included in the “Eliminations and other” category in the segment financial data in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Annual Report.

Other Matters Relating to Our Business as a Whole

Competition and Other Factors Affecting Our Businesses

As worldwide businesses, our operations
can be affected by a variety of economic and other factors, including those described in this section, in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in our 2010 Annual Report, in
Item 1, “Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results,” and in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. Each business unit is subject to significant competition from a large number of companies in
the United States and other countries, and each competes on the basis of price, delivery schedule, product performance and service.

Our
aerospace businesses are subject to substantial competition from domestic manufacturers, foreign manufacturers (whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their national
commercial products) and companies that obtain regulatory agency approval to manufacture spare parts. In particular, Pratt &







Whitney experiences intense competition for new commercial airframe/engine combinations. Engine suppliers may offer substantial discounts and other financial incentives, performance and operating
cost guarantees, participation in financing arrangements and maintenance agreements. For information regarding customer financing commitments, participation in guarantees of customer financing arrangements and performance and operating cost
guarantees, see Notes 4, 14 and 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Annual Report. Customer selections of engines and components can also have a significant impact on later sales of parts and services. In addition, the U.S.
government’s and other governments’ policies of purchasing parts from suppliers other than the original equipment manufacturer affect military spare parts sales. Significant elements of our aerospace businesses, such as spare parts sales
for engines and aircraft in service, have short lead times. Therefore, backlog information may not be indicative of future demand. Pratt & Whitney’s major competitors in the sale of engines are GE Aviation, Rolls-Royce, Honeywell and
Turbomeca.

Research and Development

Since changes in technology can have a significant impact on our operations and competitive position, we spend substantial amounts of our own funds on research and development. These expenditures, which are charged
to expense as incurred, were $1,746 million or 3.2 percent of total sales in 2010, as compared with $1,558 million or 3.0 percent of total sales in 2009 and $1,771 million or 3.0 percent of total sales in 2008. We also perform research and
development work under contracts funded by the U.S. government and other customers. This contract research and development, which is performed principally in the Pratt & Whitney segment and to a lesser extent in the Hamilton Sundstrand and
Sikorsky segments, amounted to $1,951 million in 2010, as compared to $2,124 million in 2009 and $2,101 million in 2008. These contract research and development costs include amounts that are expensed as incurred, through cost of products sold, and
amounts that are capitalized into inventory to be subsequently recovered through production aircraft shipments. Of the total contract research and development costs, $1,890 million, $2,095 million and $2,008 million were expensed in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively. The remaining costs have been capitalized.

U.S. Government Contracts

U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for default as a result of
our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we would normally be entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If terminated by the
government as a result of our default, we could be liable for additional costs the government incurs in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and any other damages it suffers. Most of our U.S. government sales are made under
fixed-price type contracts, while approximately $2,961 million or 5.5 percent of our total sales for 2010 were made under cost-reimbursement type contracts.

Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to audits. Like many defense contractors, we have received audit reports from the U.S. government which recommend that we reduce certain contract prices
because cost or pricing data we submitted in negotiation of the contract prices or cost accounting practices may not have conformed to government regulations. Some of these audit reports have recommended substantial reductions. We have made
voluntary refunds in those cases we believe appropriate, have settled some allegations and continue to litigate certain cases. For further discussion of risks related to government contracting, see the discussion in Item 1A, “Risk
Factors” and Item 3, “Legal Proceedings,” in this Form 10-K and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Annual Report for further discussion.

Compliance with Environmental and Other Government Regulations

Our operations are subject to
and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the United States and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our foreign operations. We have incurred and will likely continue to incur liabilities under
various government statutes for the cleanup of pollutants previously released into the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with current provisions relating to the protection of the environment or that any payments we may be required to
make for cleanup liabilities will have a material adverse effect upon our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations. Environmental matters are further addressed in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Notes 1 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our 2010 Annual Report.

Most of the U.S. laws governing environmental matters include criminal provisions. If we were convicted of a violation of the federal Clean Air Act or Clean Water Act, the facility or facilities involved in the
violation would be ineligible to be used in performing any U.S. government contract we are awarded until the Environmental Protection Agency thereafter certifies that the condition giving rise to the violation had been corrected.

In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to concerns over climate change. Changes in climate change
concerns, or in the regulation of such concerns, including greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including compliance costs and increased energy and raw materials costs.







We conduct our businesses through subsidiaries and affiliates worldwide. Changes in legislation or
government policies can affect our worldwide operations. For example, governmental regulation of refrigerants and energy efficiency standards, elevator safety codes and fire safety regulations are important to the businesses of Carrier, Otis and UTC
Fire & Security, respectively, while government safety and performance regulations, restrictions on aircraft engine noise and emissions and government procurement practices can impact our aerospace businesses.

Intellectual Property and Raw Materials and Supplies

We maintain a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses and franchises related to our businesses. While this portfolio is cumulatively important to our business, we do not believe that the loss of any one or group
of related patents, trademarks, licenses or franchises would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition or results of operations.

Employees and Employee Relations

For a discussion of other matters which may affect our cash flows,
competitive position, financial condition or results of operations, including the risks of our international operations, see the further discussion under the headings “General” and “Description of Business by Segment” in this
section, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K, and under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our 2010 Annual Report.

Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results
