AUTOMOTIVE PARTS
GROUP

The Automotive Parts Group, the largest division of the Company, distributes automotive parts and accessory
items. In addition to over 427,000 available part numbers, the Company offers complete inventory, cataloging, marketing, training and other programs in the automotive aftermarket. The Company, as a result of its acquisition of Quaker City Motor
Parts Co. in May 2012, is now the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association (“NAPA”), a voluntary trade association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts.

During 2012, the Company’s Automotive Parts Group included NAPA automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores
(“auto parts stores” or “NAPA AUTO PARTS stores”) owned and operated in the United States by the Company; NAPA and Traction automotive parts distribution centers and auto parts stores in the United States and Canada owned and
operated by the Company and NAPA Canada/UAP Inc. (“NAPA Canada/UAP”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; auto parts stores and distribution centers in the United States operated by corporations in which the Company owned either a
noncontrolling or controlling interest; auto parts stores in Canada operated by corporations in which UAP owns a 50% interest; import automotive parts distribution centers in the United States owned by the Company and operated by its Altrom America
division; import automotive parts distribution centers in Canada owned and operated by Altrom Canada Corporation (“Altrom Canada”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; distribution centers in the United States owned by Balkamp, Inc.
(“Balkamp”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company; distribution facilities in the United States owned by the Company and operated by its Rayloc division; and automotive parts distribution centers and automotive parts stores in Mexico,
owned and operated by Grupo Auto Todo, S.A. de C.V. (“Auto Todo”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.






The Company has a 15% interest in Mitchell Repair Information (“MRIC”), a
subsidiary of Snap-on Incorporated. MRIC is a leading automotive diagnostic and repair information company with over 40,000 North American subscribers linked to its services and information databases. MRIC’s core product, “Mitchell
ON-DEMAND”, is a premier electronic repair information source in the automotive aftermarket.

Effective January 1,
2012, the Company acquired a 30% investment in the Exego Group (“Exego”) for approximately $166 million (US$) in cash. Exego, headquartered in Melbourne, Australia, is a leading aftermarket distributor of automotive replacement parts and
accessories in Australasia, with annual revenues of approximately $1 billion (US$) and a company-owned store footprint of more than 430 locations across Australia and New Zealand. In accordance with the purchase agreement, the Company has an option
to acquire the remaining 70% interest in Exego at a later date, contingent upon Exego meeting certain earnings thresholds. In 2012, the Company accounted for this investment under the equity method of accounting.

Effective May 1, 2012, the Company acquired Quaker City Motor Parts Co. (“Quaker City”) for approximately $343 million, net
of cash acquired. Quaker City, headquartered in Middletown, Delaware, was a long standing NAPA distributor with annual revenues of approximately $300 million. Quaker City serves approximately 270 auto parts stores, of which approximately 140 are
company-owned. The Company funded the acquisition with cash on hand and short-term borrowings under credit facilities.

The
Company’s NAPA automotive parts distribution centers distribute replacement parts (other than body parts) for substantially all motor vehicle makes and models in service in the United States, including imported vehicles, trucks, SUVs, buses,
motorcycles, recreational vehicles and farm vehicles. In addition, the Company distributes replacement parts for small engines, farm equipment and heavy duty equipment. The Company’s inventories also include accessory items for such vehicles
and equipment, and supply items used by a wide variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket, such as repair shops, service stations, fleet operators, automobile and truck dealers, leasing companies, bus and truck lines, mass merchandisers,
farms, industrial concerns and individuals who perform their own maintenance and parts installation. Although the Company’s domestic automotive operations purchase from approximately 100 different suppliers, approximately 53% of 2012 automotive
parts inventories were purchased from 10 major suppliers. Since 1931, the Company has had return privileges with most of its suppliers, which have protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

Distribution System.In 2012, the Company operated 64 domestic NAPA automotive parts distribution
centers located in 41 states and approximately 1,100 domestic company-owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located in 46 states. At December 31, 2012, the Company owned either a noncontrolling or controlling interest in ten corporations,
which operated approximately 58 auto parts stores in eight states.

NAPA Canada/UAP, founded in 1926, is a
Canadian leader in the distribution and marketing of replacement parts and accessories for automobiles and trucks. NAPA Canada/UAP employs approximately 3,600 people and operates a network of 12 distribution centers supplying approximately 595
NAPA stores and 103 Traction wholesalers. Traction is a supplier of parts to small and large fleet owners and operators and, together with NAPA stores, is a significant supplier to the mining and forestry industries. The NAPA stores and Traction
wholesalers in Canada include approximately 184 company owned stores, 13 joint ventures and 27 progressive owners in which NAPA Canada/UAP owns a 50% interest and approximately 474 independently owned stores. NAPA and Traction operations supply
bannered installers and independent installers in all provinces of Canada, as well as networks of service stations and repair shops operating under the banners of national accounts. UAP is a licensee of the NAPA®name in Canada.

In Canada, Altrom Canada operates 14 import automotive parts distribution centers. In the United States, Altrom America operates two import automotive parts distribution centers.

In Mexico, Auto Todo owns and operates 11 distribution centers, four auto parts stores and four tire centers. Auto
Todo is a licensee of the NAPA®name in Mexico.

The Company’s domestic distribution centers serve approximately 4,900 independently owned NAPA AUTO PARTS stores located throughout
the United States. NAPA AUTO PARTS stores, in turn, sell to a wide






variety of customers in the automotive aftermarket. Collectively, these independent automotive parts stores account for approximately 65% of the Company’s total U.S. Automotive sales and 25%
of the Company’s total sales, with no automotive parts store or group of automotive parts stores with individual or common ownership accounting for more than 0.25% of the total sales of the Company.

Products.Distribution centers have access to over 427,000 different parts and
related supply items. Each item is cataloged and numbered for identification and accessibility. Significant inventories are carried to provide for fast and frequent deliveries to customers. Most orders are filled and shipped the same day as they are
received. The majority of sales are paid from statements with varied terms and conditions. The Company does not manufacture any of the products it distributes. The majority of products are distributed under the NAPA®name, a mark licensed to the Company by NAPA, which is important to the sales and marketing of these products.
Traction sales also include products distributed under the HD Plus name, a proprietary line of automotive parts for the heavy duty truck market.

Related Operations.Balkamp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, distributes a wide variety of replacement parts and accessory items for passenger cars,
heavy-duty vehicles, motorcycles and farm equipment. In addition, Balkamp distributes service items such as testing equipment, lubricating equipment, gauges, cleaning supplies, chemicals and supply items used by repair shops, fleets, farms and
institutions. Balkamp packages many of the 63,000 products, which constitute the “Balkamp” line of products that are distributed through the NAPA system. These products are categorized into over 240 different product groups purchased from
approximately 450 domestic suppliers and 100 foreign manufacturers. Balkamp has two distribution centers located in Plainfield, Indiana, and West Jordan, Utah. In addition, Balkamp operates two redistribution centers that provide the NAPA system
with over 1,500 SKUs of oils, chemicals and procurement items. BALKAMP®, a federally registered trademark, is
important to the sales and marketing promotions of the Balkamp organization.

The Company, through its
Rayloc division, operates four facilities where certain small automotive parts are distributed through the NAPA system under the NAPA®brand name. Rayloc®is a mark
licensed to the Company by NAPA.

The Company’s Heavy Vehicle Parts Group operates as TW Distribution, with one warehouse
location in Atlanta, Georgia, which serves 23 Traction Heavy Duty parts stores in the United States, of which 15 are company-owned and eight are independently owned. This group distributes heavy vehicle parts through the NAPA system and direct to
small fleet owners and operators.

Segment Data.In the years ended December 31, 2012
and 2011, sales from the Automotive Parts Group were approximately 49% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 50% in 2010. For additional segment information, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on
page F-1.

Service to NAPA AUTO PARTS Stores.The Company
believes that the quality and the range of services provided to its automotive parts customers constitute a significant advantage for its automotive parts distribution system. Such services include fast and frequent delivery, parts cataloging
(including the use of electronic NAPA AUTO PARTS catalogs) and stock adjustment through a continuing parts classification system which, as initiated by the Company from time to time, allows independent retailers (“jobbers”) to return
certain merchandise on a scheduled basis. The Company offers its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers various management aids, marketing aids and service on topics such as inventory control, cost analysis, accounting procedures, group insurance and
retirement benefit plans, as well as marketing conferences and seminars, sales and advertising manuals and training programs. Point of sale/inventory management is available through TAMS®(Total Automotive Management Systems), a computer system designed and developed by the Company for the NAPA AUTO PARTS stores.

The Company, has developed and refined an inventory classification system to determine optimum distribution center and auto parts store
inventory levels for automotive parts stocking based on automotive registrations, usage rates, production statistics, technological advances and other similar factors. This system, which undergoes continuous analytical review, is an integral part of
the Company’s inventory control procedures and comprises an important feature of the inventory management services that the Company






makes available to its NAPA AUTO PARTS store customers. Over the last 20 years, losses to the Company from obsolescence have been insignificant and the Company attributes this to the
successful operation of its classification system, which involves product return privileges with most of its suppliers.

Competition.The automotive parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Company competes
with automobile manufacturers (some of which sell replacement parts for vehicles built by other manufacturers as well as those that they build themselves), automobile dealers, warehouse clubs and large automotive parts retail chains. In addition,
the Company competes with the distributing outlets of parts manufacturers, oil companies, mass merchandisers, including national retail chains, and with other parts distributors and retailers. The Automotive Parts Group competes primarily on product
offering, service, brand recognition and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”

NAPA.The Company is the sole member of the National Automotive Parts Association, a
voluntary association formed in 1925 to provide nationwide distribution of automotive parts. NAPA, which neither buys nor sells automotive parts, functions as a trade association whose members in 2012 owned and operated 64 distribution centers
located throughout the United States. NAPA develops marketing concepts and programs that may be used by its members which, at December 31, 2012, includes only the Company. It is not involved in the chain of distribution.

Among the automotive lines within the NAPA system that the Company purchases and distributes are certain lines designated, cataloged,
advertised and promoted as “NAPA” lines. The Company is not required to purchase any specific quantity of parts so designated and may, and does, purchase competitive lines from other supply sources.

The Company uses the federally registered trademark NAPA®as part of the trade name of its distribution centers and parts stores. The Company contributes to NAPA’s national advertising program, which is designed to
increase public recognition of the NAPA name and to promote NAPA product lines.

The Company is a party, together with the
former members of NAPA, to a consent decree entered by the Federal District Court in Detroit, Michigan, on May 4, 1954. The consent decree enjoins certain practices under the federal antitrust laws, including the use of exclusive agreements
with manufacturers of automotive parts, allocation or division of territories among the Company and former NAPA members, fixing of prices or terms of sale for such parts among such members, and agreements to adhere to any uniform policy in selecting
parts customers or determining the number and location of, or arrangements with, auto parts customers.

INDUSTRIAL PARTS GROUP

The Industrial Parts Group is operated as Motion Industries, Inc. (“Motion”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama. Motion distributes industrial replacement parts and related supplies such as bearings, mechanical and electrical power transmission, industrial automation, hose, hydraulic and pneumatic components,
industrial supplies and material handling products to MRO (maintenance, repair and operation) and OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers throughout the United States, Canada and Mexico.

In Canada, industrial parts are distributed by Motion Industries (Canada), Inc. (“Motion Canada”). The Mexican market is served
by Motion Mexico S de RL de CV (“Motion Mexico”). These organizations operate in the Company’s North American structure.

As of December 31, 2012, the Industrial Parts Group served more than 150,000 customers in all types of industries located throughout North America, including the food and beverage, forest products,
primary metal, pulp and paper, mining, automotive, oil and gas, petrochemical and pharmaceutical industries; as well as strategically targeted specialty industries such as power generation, wastewater treatment facilities, wind power generation,
solar power, government projects, pipelines, railroad, ports, and others. Motion services all manufacturing and processing industries with access to a database of 4.8 million parts. Additionally, Motion provides U.S. government agencies access
to approximately 585,000 products and replacement parts through a Government Services Administration (GSA) schedule.






The Industrial Parts Group provides customers with supply chain efficiencies achieved
through inventory management and logistical solutions coupled with Motion’s vast product knowledge and system capabilities. The Company meets the MRO demand of a large and fragmented market with high levels of service in the areas of asset
management, inventory and logistics management, product application and utilization management processes. A highly developed supply chain with vendor partnerships and customer connectivity are enhanced by Motion’s leading e-business
capabilities, such as MiSupplierConnect, which provides integration between the Company’s information technology network and suppliers’ systems, creating numerous benefits for both the supplier and customer.

Distribution System.In North America, the Industrial Parts Group operated 509 branches, 14
distribution centers and 50 service centers as of December 31, 2012. The distribution centers stock and distribute more than 240,000 different items purchased from more than 1,100 different suppliers. The service centers provide hydraulic, hose
and mechanical repairs for customers. Approximately 50% of 2012 total industrial product purchases were made from 10 major suppliers. Sales are generated from the Industrial Parts Group’s branches located in 48 states, Puerto Rico, nine
provinces in Canada, and Mexico. Each branch has warehouse facilities that stock significant amounts of inventory representative of the products used by customers in the respective market area served.

Products.The Industrial Parts Group distributes a wide variety of parts and products to its
customers, primarily industrial concerns. Products include such items as hoses, belts, bearings, pulleys, pumps, valves, chains, gears, sprockets, speed reducers, electric motors, and industrial supplies. In recent years, Motion expanded its
offering to include systems and automation products in response to the increasing sophistication of motion control and process automation for full systems integration of plant equipment. Manufacturing trends and government policies have led to
opportunities in the “green” and energy-efficient product markets, focusing on product offerings such as energy-efficient motors and drives, recyclable and environmentally friendly parts and supplies. The nature of this group’s
business demands the maintenance of adequate inventories and the ability to promptly meet demanding delivery requirements. Virtually all of the products distributed are installed by the customer or used in plant and facility maintenance activities.
Most orders are filled immediately from existing stock and deliveries are normally made within 24 hours of receipt of order. The majority of all sales are on open account. Motion has ongoing purchase agreements with existing customers that
represent approximately 50% of the annual sales volume.

Supply Agreements.Non-exclusive
distributor agreements are in effect with most of the Industrial Parts Group’s suppliers. The terms of these agreements vary; however, it has been the experience of the Industrial Parts Group that the custom of the trade is to treat such
agreements as continuing until breached by one party or until terminated by mutual consent. Motion has return privileges with most of its suppliers, which has protected the Company from inventory obsolescence.

Segment Data.In the year ended December 31, 2012, sales from the Company’s Industrial
Parts Group approximated 34% of the Company’s net sales, as compared to 33% in 2011 and 31% in 2010. For additional segment information, see Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page F-1.

Competition.The industrial parts distribution business is highly competitive. The Industrial Parts
Group competes with other distributors specializing in the distribution of such items, general line distributors and others who provide similar services. To a lesser extent, the Industrial Parts Group competes with manufacturers that sell directly
to the customer. The Industrial Parts Group competes primarily on the breadth of product offerings, service and price. Further information regarding competition in the industry is set forth in “Item 1A. Risk Factors — We Face
Substantial Competition in the Industries in Which We Do Business.”
