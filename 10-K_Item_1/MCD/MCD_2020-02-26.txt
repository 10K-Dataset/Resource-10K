BUSINESS SUMMARY

a. General

Effective January 1, 2019, McDonald's operates under an organizational structure designed to support the Company's efforts toward efficiently driving growth through the Velocity Growth Plan (the "Plan"). The Company’s reporting segments are aligned with its strategic priorities and reflect how management reviews and evaluates operating performance. Significant reportable segments include the United States ("U.S.") and International Operated Markets. In addition, throughout this report we present the International Developmental Licensed Markets & Corporate segment, which includes markets in over 80 countries, as well as Corporate activities.

b. Description of business

•

General

The Company franchises and operates McDonald’s restaurants, which serve a locally-relevant menu of quality food and beverages in 119 countries. Of the 38,695 restaurants at year-end 2019, 36,059 were franchised, which is 93% of McDonald's restaurants.

McDonald’s franchised restaurants are owned and operated under one of the following structures - conventional franchise, developmental license or affiliate. The optimal ownership structure for an individual restaurant, trading area or market (country) is based on a variety of factors, including the availability of individuals with the entrepreneurial experience and financial resources, as well as the local legal and regulatory environment in critical areas such as property ownership and franchising. The business relationship between McDonald’s and its independent franchisees is supported by adhering to standards and policies and is of fundamental importance to overall performance and to protecting the McDonald’s brand.

The Company is primarily a franchisor and believes franchising is paramount to delivering great-tasting food, locally relevant customer experiences and driving profitability. Franchising enables an individual to be their own employer and maintain control over all employment related matters, marketing and pricing decisions, while also benefiting from the strength of McDonald’s global brand, operating system and financial resources.

Directly operating McDonald’s restaurants contributes significantly to our ability to act as a credible franchisor. One of the strengths of the franchising model is that the expertise from operating Company-owned restaurants allows McDonald’s to improve the operations and success of all restaurants while innovations from franchisees can be tested and, when viable, efficiently implemented across relevant restaurants. Having Company-owned and operated restaurants provides Company personnel with a venue for restaurant operations training experience. In addition, in our Company-owned and operated restaurants, and in collaboration with franchisees, we are able to further develop and refine operating standards, marketing concepts and product and pricing strategies that will ultimately benefit McDonald’s restaurants.

The Company’s revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees. Fees vary by type of site, amount of Company investment, if any, and local business conditions. These fees, along with occupancy and operating rights, are stipulated in franchise/license agreements that generally have 20-year terms.

Conventional Franchise

Under a conventional franchise arrangement, the Company generally owns or secures a long-term lease on the land and building for the restaurant location and the franchisee pays for equipment, signs, seating and décor. The Company believes that ownership of real estate, combined with the co-investment by franchisees, enables us to achieve restaurant performance levels that are among the highest in the industry.

Franchisees are also responsible for reinvesting capital in their businesses over time. In addition, to accelerate implementation of certain initiatives, the Company may co-invest with franchisees to fund improvements to their restaurants or their operating systems. These investments, developed in collaboration with franchisees, are designed to cater to consumer preferences, improve local business performance, and increase the value of our brand through the development of modernized, more attractive and higher revenue generating restaurants.

The Company requires franchisees to meet rigorous standards and generally does not work with passive investors. The business relationship with franchisees is designed to facilitate consistency and high quality at all McDonald’s restaurants. Conventional franchisees contribute to the Company’s revenue, primarily through the payment of rent and royalties based upon a percent of sales, with specified minimum rent payments, along with initial fees paid upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new franchise. This structure enables McDonald’s to generate significant and predictable levels of cash flow.

Developmental License or Affiliate

Under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, licensees are responsible for operating and managing the business, providing capital (including the real estate interest) and developing and opening new restaurants. The Company generally does not invest any capital under a developmental license or affiliate arrangement, and it receives a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally receives initial fees upon the opening of a new restaurant or grant of a new license.

While developmental license and affiliate arrangements are largely the same, affiliate arrangements are used in a limited number of foreign markets (primarily China and Japan) where the Company also has an equity investment and records its share of net results in Equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates.

•

Supply chain, food safety, and quality assurance

The Company and its franchisees purchase food, packaging, equipment, and other goods from numerous independent suppliers. The Company has established and enforces high food safety and quality standards. The Company has quality centers around the world designed to promote consistency of its high standards. The quality assurance process not only involves ongoing product reviews, but also on-site supplier visits. A Food Safety Advisory Council, composed of the Company’s internal food safety experts, as well as suppliers and outside academia, provides strategic global leadership for all aspects of food safety. We have ongoing programs to educate employees about food safety practices, and our suppliers and restaurant operators participate in food safety trainings where we share best practices on food safety and quality. In addition, the Company works closely with suppliers to encourage innovation and drive continuous improvement. Leveraging scale, supply chain infrastructure and risk management strategies, the Company also collaborates with suppliers toward a goal of achieving competitive, predictable food and paper costs over the long term.

Independently owned and operated distribution centers, approved by the Company, distribute products and supplies to McDonald’s restaurants. In addition, restaurant personnel are trained in the proper storage, handling and preparation of food for customers.

•

Products

McDonald’s restaurants offer a substantially uniform menu, although there are geographic variations to suit local consumer preferences and tastes.

McDonald’s menu includes hamburgers and cheeseburgers, Big Mac, Quarter Pounder with Cheese, Filet-O-Fish, several chicken sandwiches, Chicken McNuggets, wraps, McDonald's Fries, salads, oatmeal, shakes, McFlurry desserts, sundaes, soft serve cones, pies, soft drinks, coffee, McCafé beverages and other beverages.

McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. and many international markets offer a full or limited breakfast menu. Breakfast offerings may include Egg McMuffin, Sausage McMuffin with Egg, McGriddles, biscuit and bagel sandwiches and hotcakes.

In addition to these menu items, the restaurants sell a variety of other products during limited-time promotions.

Taste, quality, choice and nutrition are important to our customers, and we are continuously evolving our menu to meet our customers' needs, including testing new products on an ongoing basis.

•

Marketing

McDonald’s global brand is well known. Marketing, promotional and public relations activities are designed to promote McDonald’s brand and differentiate the Company from competitors. Marketing and promotional efforts focus on value, quality, food taste, menu choice, nutrition, convenience and the customer experience.

2019 Annual Report

In measuring the Company’s competitive position, management reviews data compiled by Euromonitor International, a leading source of market data with respect to the global restaurant industry. The Company’s primary competition, which is referred to as the informal eating out ("IEO") segment, includes the following restaurant categories defined by Euromonitor International: limited-service restaurants (which combines quick-service eating establishments and 100% home delivery/takeaway providers), street stalls or kiosks, cafés, specialist coffee shops, self-service cafeterias and juice/smoothie bars. The IEO segment excludes establishments that primarily serve alcohol and full-service restaurants other than providers with limited table service.

Based on data from Euromonitor International, the global IEO segment was composed of approximately

9 million

outlets and generated

$1.2 trillion

in annual sales in

2018

, the most recent year for which data is available. McDonald’s Systemwide

2018

restaurant business accounted for

0.4%

of those outlets and

8.2%

of the sales.

Management also on occasion benchmarks McDonald’s against the entire restaurant industry, including the IEO segment defined above and all full-service restaurants. Based on data from Euromonitor International, the restaurant industry was composed of approximately

20 million

outlets and generated

$2.7 trillion

in annual sales in

2018

. McDonald’s Systemwide restaurant business accounted for

0.2%

of those outlets and

3.6%

of the sales.

•

Environmental matters

The Company continuously monitors developments related to environmental matters, and endeavors to improve its social responsibility and environmental practices to achieve long-term sustainability, which benefits McDonald’s and the communities it serves.

Actual or perceived effects of changes in weather patterns, climate, water resources, or packaging waste could have a direct or indirect impact on the operations of the System in ways which we cannot fully predict at this time.

The Company launched a framework in 2018, which includes the environment-related pillars of climate action, packaging and recycling, beef sustainability, and other sustainable sourcing efforts. These include goals and initiatives to reduce System greenhouse gas emissions, responsibly source ingredients and packaging, and increase the availability of recycling in restaurants to reduce waste, which the Company recognizes are also increasingly important to customers.

The Company monitors environment-related governmental initiatives and consumer preferences, and plans to respond in a timely and appropriate manner. Increased focus by certain governmental authorities or consumers on environmental matters may lead to new governmental initiatives or opportunities. While we cannot predict the precise nature of these initiatives, we expect that they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. Although the impact would likely vary by world region and/or market, we believe that adoption of new regulations may increase costs or operational complexity for the Company.

MANAGEMENT'S VIEW OF THE BUSINESS

In analyzing business trends, management reviews results on a constant currency basis and considers a variety of performance and financial measures which are considered to be non-GAAP, including comparable sales and comparable guest count growth, Systemwide sales growth, return on incremental invested capital ("ROIIC"), free cash flow and free cash flow conversion rate, as described below. Management believes these measures are important in understanding the financial performance of the Company.

•

Constant currency results exclude the effects of foreign currency translation and are calculated by translating current year results at prior year average exchange rates. Management reviews and analyzes business results excluding the effect of foreign currency translation, impairment and other strategic charges and gains, as well as income tax provision adjustments related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 ("Tax Act"), and bases incentive compensation plans on these results, because the Company believes this better represents underlying business trends.

•

Comparable sales represent sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed. Some of the reasons restaurants may be temporarily closed include reimaging or remodeling, rebuilding, road construction and natural disasters. Comparable sales exclude the impact of currency translation, and, since 2017, also exclude sales from Venezuela due to its hyper-inflation. Management generally identifies hyper-inflationary markets as those markets whose cumulative inflation rate over a three-year period exceeds 100%. Comparable sales are driven by changes in guest counts and average check, which is affected by changes in pricing and product mix. The goal is to achieve a relatively balanced contribution from both guest counts and average check.

•

Comparable guest counts represent the number of transactions at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees, in operation at least thirteen months including those temporarily closed.

•

Systemwide sales include sales at all restaurants, whether operated by the Company or by franchisees. While franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, management believes the information is important in understanding the Company’s financial performance because these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates.

•

ROIIC is a measure reviewed by management over one-year and three-year time periods to evaluate the overall profitability of the markets, the effectiveness of capital deployed and the future allocation of capital. The return is calculated by dividing the change in operating income plus depreciation and amortization (numerator) by the cash used for investing activities (denominator), primarily capital expenditures. The calculation uses a constant average foreign exchange rate over the periods included in the calculation.

•

Free cash flow, defined as cash provided by operations less capital expenditures, and free cash flow conversion rate, defined as free cash flow divided by net income, are measures reviewed by management in order to evaluate the Company’s ability to convert net profits into cash resources, after reinvesting in the core business, that can be used to pursue opportunities to enhance shareholder value.

STRATEGIC DIRECTION

The strength of the alignment among the Company, its franchisees and suppliers is key to McDonald's long-term success. By leveraging the System, McDonald’s is able to identify, implement and scale ideas that meet customers' changing needs and preferences. McDonald's continually builds on its competitive advantages of System alignment and geographic diversification to deliver consistent, yet locally-relevant restaurant experiences to customers as an integral part of their communities.

CUSTOMER-CENTRIC GROWTH STRATEGY

The Velocity Growth Plan, the Company’s customer-centric strategy, is rooted in extensive customer research and insights, along with a deep understanding of the key drivers of the business. The Plan is designed to drive sustainable comparable sales and guest count growth, reliable long-term measures of the Company's strength that are vital to growing shareholder value. In 2019, execution of the Plan drove further broad-based growth around the globe. In 2020, the Company will continue to focus on elevating the customer experience through improved restaurant execution and creating excitement around our food and value offerings, while continuing to leverage technology to enable greater convenience and customer personalization.

The Company continues to target the opportunity at the core of its business - its food, value and customer experience. The strategy is built on the following three pillars, all focusing on building a better McDonald’s:

•

Retaining existing customers

- focusing on areas where it already has a strong foothold in the IEO category, including family occasions and food-led breakfast.

•

Regaining customers who visit less often

- recommitting to areas of historic strength, namely food taste and quality, convenience and speed, experience and value.

•

Converting casual to committed customers

- building stronger relationships with customers so they visit more often, by elevating and leveraging the McCafé coffee brand and enhancing snack and treat offerings.

The Company continues to scale and optimize the Plan through the following growth accelerators:

•

Experience of the Future

.  The Company is building upon its investments in EOTF, focusing on restaurant modernization in order to transform the restaurant service experience and enhance our brand in the eyes of our customers. The modernization efforts are designed to provide a better customer experience, leading to increased frequency of customer visits and higher average check. As of the end of 2019, EOTF is deployed in over half of the restaurants in our global system, with most of the major markets substantially complete. In 2019, the U.S. converted about 2,000 restaurants to EOTF, resulting in about 70% of the U.S. restaurants now having EOTF. In 2020, the Company will further deploy EOTF around the globe, including converting about 1,800 of the remaining restaurants in the U.S. to EOTF.

•

Digital

.

The Company is improving its existing service model with customers through technology. Digital technology is transforming the retail industry, and the Company is using it to transform McDonald’s for our customers at an accelerated pace. By evolving the technology platform, the Company is expanding choices for how customers order, pay and are served their food. The added functionality of the Company’s global mobile app, self-order kiosks, and other technologies enable greater convenience for the customer on their terms. In 2019, the Company built on its digital foundation, acquiring Dynamic Yield, a leader in personalization and decision logic technology. The Company has implemented this technology via outdoor digital menu boards in over 11,000 U.S. drive-thrus, offering customers a more customized experience and producing sales growth through higher average check. This technology is also deployed in nearly all drive-thrus in Australia, and we are looking to deploy across further international markets beginning in 2020. The Company continued to expand its technological capabilities via the acquisition of Apprente, an early-stage leader in conversational interface technology. This technology is expected to provide more efficient and accurate ordering in the drive-thru. In 2020, the Company will continue to utilize more personalized digital initiatives to engage customers, grow awareness and adoption of digital offerings, and support our menu offerings.

Delivery

.  The Company continues to build momentum with its delivery platform as a way of expanding the convenience for its customers. In 2019, McDonald’s continued to add third-party delivery partners in order to maximize the System’s delivery scale and potential.  Across the global system, nearly 25,000 restaurants now offer delivery. Customers are responding positively, as demonstrated by high satisfaction ratings, strong reorder rates, and average checks that are generally two times higher than average non-delivery transactions. Further, in some of our top markets, delivery now represents as much as 10% of sales in those restaurants offering delivery. Consequently, McDonald’s global delivery business has grown to over $4 billion in Systemwide sales in 2019, up from $1 billion in 2016. We continue to see great runway ahead of us to drive awareness and trial of delivery, and are focusing on efforts to encourage frequency and retention in 2020 and beyond.

The Plan is a global strategy that is tailored at a market level to allow for the best customer experience and most convenience for our valued customers. While the Plan provides a consistent framework on how to retain, regain, and convert customers, the execution varies across the globe. The U.S., for example, remains centered on returning to guest count growth by focusing on running better restaurant operations, introducing new menu items and offering compelling value. In addition, we will continue transforming the customer experience through aggressive execution of the growth accelerators of EOTF, digital and delivery. In 2020, the markets around the world will continue to make progress on the three pillars of the Plan and its growth accelerators, focusing on food, value and customer convenience.

Our Plan also includes the Company further embedding actions in response to certain social and environmental issues into the core of our business. As one of the world’s largest restaurant companies, our approach highlights our commitment to global actions that are consistent with our strategic priorities and provides an opportunity to collaborate with our franchisees and suppliers to drive meaningful progress. We recognize that our success in advancing these initiatives will be demonstrated as customers continue to feel good about visiting McDonald’s restaurants and eating our food.

While we are working to address many challenges facing society today, we are elevating global action where we believe we can make the greatest difference in driving industry-wide change. Our priorities reflect the social and environmental impacts of our food and our business. Highlights include science-based targets for greenhouse gas emissions reductions and climate action, advancing sustainable practices in beef production with suppliers and producers, driving innovative solutions for our packaging and recycling efforts, and ongoing commitments to support families and provide opportunities for youth in our communities. In 2019, for example, we made progress toward our 2030 climate action target with the addition of significant investments in renewable energy projects in the U.S.; we achieved our goal of 100% sustainably sourced McCafé coffee for U.S. restaurants; and we continued to make a difference for families through innovation in our food offerings, reading programs and support for Ronald McDonald House Charities.

The Company is confident, that under the Plan, we will continue to improve the taste of our delicious food, enhance convenience and service through running great restaurants, offer compelling value, and heighten the trust consumers place in our brand, which we believe will enable us to deliver long-term sustainable growth.

OUTLOOK

2020 Outlook

The following information is provided to assist in forecasting the Company’s future results.

•

Changes in Systemwide sales are driven by comparable sales, net restaurant unit expansion, and the potential impacts of hyper-inflation. The Company expects net restaurant additions to add approximately 1.5 percentage points to 2020 Systemwide sales growth (in constant currencies).

•

The Company expects full year 2020 selling, general and administrative expenses to increase about 5% to 7% in constant currencies as the Company invests in technology and research & development, and incurs costs related to the Worldwide Owner/Operator Convention, which will occur in the second quarter 2020.

•

Based on current interest and foreign currency exchange rates, the Company expects interest expense for the full year 2020 to increase about 4% to 6% due primarily to higher average debt balances.

•

A significant part of the Company's operating income is generated outside the U.S., and about 40% of its total debt is denominated in foreign currencies. Accordingly, earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, British Pound, Australian Dollar and Canadian Dollar. Collectively, these currencies represent approximately 80% of the Company's operating income outside the U.S. If all four of these currencies moved by 10% in the same direction, the Company's annual diluted earnings per share would change by about 35 cents.

•

The Company expects the effective income tax rate for the full year 2020 to be in the 23% to 25% range. Some volatility may result in a quarterly tax rate outside of the annual range.

•

The Company expects capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $2.4 billion. About $1.3 billion will be dedicated to our U.S. business, over half of which is allocated to approximately 1,800 EOTF projects. Globally, we expect to open roughly 1,400 restaurants. We will spend approximately $800 million in the U.S. and International Operated segments to open 400 restaurants and our developmental licensees and affiliates will contribute capital towards the remaining 1,000 restaurant openings in the International Developmental Licensed segment. The Company expects about 1,000 net restaurant additions in 2020.

Long-Term Outlook

•

Over the long-term, the Company expects to achieve the following average annual (constant currency) financial targets:

◦

Systemwide sales growth of 3% to 5%;

◦

Operating margin in the mid-40% range;

◦

Earnings per share growth in the high-single digits; and

◦

Return on incremental invested capital in the mid-20% range.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ON REPORTED RESULTS

While changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect reported results, McDonald’s mitigates exposures, where practical, by purchasing goods and services in local currencies, financing in local currencies and hedging certain foreign-denominated cash flows.

In 2019, results reflected the weakening of the Euro and most other major currencies. In 2018, results reflected the stronger Euro and British Pound. In 2017, results reflected the stronger Euro, offset by the weaker British Pound.

Results in 2019 reflected stronger operating performance primarily due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses (mostly in the U.S.) and higher G&A spend. Results in 2018 reflected a lower effective tax rate, and stronger operating performance due to an increase in sales-driven franchised margin dollars, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars due to the impact of refranchising.

Outlined below is additional information for the full year 2019, 2018, and 2017:

Included in the 2019 results were:

◦

$84 million, or $0.11 per share, of income tax benefit due to new regulations issued in the fourth quarter 2019 related to the Tax Act; and

◦

$74 million of pre-tax strategic charges, or $0.07 per share, primarily related to impairment associated with the purchase of our joint venture partner's interest in the India Delhi market, partly offset by gains on the sales of property at the former Corporate headquarters.

Included in the 2018 results were:

◦

$75 million, or $0.10 per share, of net tax cost associated with the final 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in December 2017 under the Tax Act;

◦

$140 million of pre-tax, non-cash impairment charges, or $0.17 per share; and

◦

$94 million of pre-tax strategic restructuring charges, or $0.09 per share.

Included in the 2017 results were:

◦

$700 million of net tax cost associated with the Tax Act, or $0.82 per share; and

◦

a pre-tax gain of $850 million on the sale of the Company’s businesses in China and Hong Kong, offset in part by $150 million of restructuring and impairment charges in connection with the Company’s global G&A and refranchising initiatives, for a net benefit of $0.53 per share.

Excluding the above 2019 and 2018 items, 2019 net income decreased 3% (1% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share decreased 1% (increased 2% in constant currencies). Excluding items impacting 2018 and 2017, 2018 net income increased 14% (14% in constant currencies), and diluted earnings per share increased 19% (18% in constant currencies).

The Company repurchased

25.0 million

shares of its stock for $5.0 billion in

2019

and

32.2 million

shares of its stock for

$5.2 billion

in

2018

, driving reductions in weighted-average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in both periods, which positively benefited earnings per share.

REVENUES

The Company's revenues consist of sales by Company-operated restaurants and fees from franchised restaurants operated by conventional franchisees, developmental licensees and affiliates. Revenues from conventional franchised restaurants include rent and royalties based on a percent of sales with minimum rent payments, and initial fees. Revenues from restaurants licensed to developmental licensees and affiliates include a royalty based on a percent of sales, and generally include initial fees. Initial fees are recognized evenly over the franchise term.

Franchised restaurants represent 93% of McDonald's restaurants worldwide at December 31, 2019. The Company's current mix of Company-owned and franchised restaurants enables the Company to generate stable and predictable revenue and cash flow streams. Refranchising to a greater percentage of franchised restaurants may negatively impact consolidated revenues as Company-operated sales are replaced by franchised revenues, where the Company receives rent and/or royalty revenue based on a percent of sales.

In 2019, revenues were relatively flat with the prior year (increased 3% in constant currencies). The constant currency increase was primarily due to strong comparable sales, partly offset by the impact of refranchising.  In 2018, revenues decreased 8% (8% in constant currencies), reflecting the Company's strategic refranchising initiatives, partly offset by positive comparable sales.

, the constant currency increase in revenues reflected positive comparable sales across all markets, partly offset by the impact of refranchising.

The following tables present comparable sales, comparable guest counts and Systemwide sales increases/(decreases):

**  The Company excludes sales from markets identified as hyper-inflationary (currently, only Venezuela) from the comparable sales calculation as the Company believes this more accurately reflects the underlying business trends.

***  Unlike comparable sales, the Company has not excluded hyper-inflationary market results (currently, only Venezuela) from Systemwide sales as these sales are the basis on which the Company calculates and records revenues. The difference between comparable sales growth rates and Systemwide sales growth rates are due to both restaurant expansion and the hyper-inflationary impact.

Franchised sales are not recorded as revenues by the Company, but are the basis on which the Company calculates and records franchised revenues and are indicative of the financial health of the franchisee base. The following table presents franchised sales and the related increases/(decreases):

Franchised sales

* Reflects the impact of refranchising the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong in 2017.

FRANCHISED MARGINS

Franchised margin dollars represent revenues from franchised restaurants less the Company’s costs associated with those restaurants, primarily occupancy costs (rent and depreciation). Franchised margin dollars represented about 85% of the combined restaurant margins in

2019

and

2018

, and about 80% in 2017.

In

2019

, franchised margin dollars

increased

$416 million

or

5%

(

7%

in constant currencies). In

2018

, franchised margin dollars increased

$727 million

or

9%

(

8%

in constant currencies). For both 2019 and 2018, the increases were due to positive comparable sales performance across all segments, as well as expansion and the impact of refranchising.

Franchised margins

The adoption of Accounting Standard Codification ("ASC") Topic 842, "Leases" ("ASC 842") had no impact on franchised margin dollars, but had a negative impact on the Company's franchised margin percent for 2019 of approximately 1.3% in the U.S. and 0.7% on a consolidated basis. ASC 842 clarified the presentation of sub-lease income and lease expense, requiring the straight-line impact of fixed rent escalations to be presented on a gross basis in lease income and lease expense.

•

U.S.:

In

2019

and

2018

, the decreases in the franchised margin percents were primarily due to higher depreciation costs related to investments in EOTF, partly offset by the benefit from positive comparable sales. 2019 also reflected the impact of the new lease standard.

U.S.:

In

2019

, the increase in the Company-operated margin percent primarily reflected the benefit from positive comparable sales, partly offset by higher commodity costs, wages and depreciation expense associated with EOTF deployment. In

2018

, the Company-operated margin percent decreased, reflecting the impact of accelerated deployment of EOTF (including the related decrease in labor productivity and higher depreciation expense), and higher wages and commodity costs, which more than offset the benefit from positive comparable sales and refranchising.

International Operated Markets:

In 2019 and 2018, the increase in the Company-operated margin percent was primarily due to strong comparable sales partly offset by higher labor and occupancy & other costs.

Gains on sales of restaurant businesses

In 2019, gains on sales of restaurant businesses decreased primarily due to fewer restaurant sales in the U.S.

•

Impairment and other charges (gains), net

In 2019, impairment and other charges (gains), net primarily reflected $99.4 million of impairment associated with the purchase of our joint venture partner's interest in the India Delhi market. Impairment was recorded to reflect the write-down of net assets to fair value in accordance with accounting rules. This was partly offset by $20.3 million of gains on the sales of property at the former Corporate headquarters which were impaired in 2015 based on estimated fair values.

The results in 2018 reflected $140 million of impairment charges due to the Company’s assessment of the recoverability of long-lived assets as well as the strategic restructuring charge in the U.S. of $85.0 million.

The results in 2017 reflected a gain on the Company's sale of its businesses in China and Hong Kong of $850 million, partly offset by $150 million of restructuring and impairment charges.

U.S.:

Excluding the 2018 strategic restructuring charge of $85 million, operating income decreased 1% for 2019 and increased 2% for 2018. 2019 results reflected lower gains on sales of restaurant businesses, partly offset by higher franchised margin dollars. 2018 results reflected higher franchised margin dollars and lower G&A costs, partly offset by lower Company-operated margin dollars.

•

International Operated Markets:

In 2019 and 2018, the constant currency operating income increase was primarily due to sales-driven improvements in franchised margin dollars. 2018 results also reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses in the U.K. and Australia compared to 2017.

,

2018

and

2017

, the reported effective income tax rates were

24.9%

,

24.2%

and 39.4%, respectively.

The effective income tax rate for 2019 reflected $84 million of income tax benefit due to new regulations issued in the fourth quarter 2019 related to the Tax Act. Excluding the income tax benefit, the effective income tax rate was 25.9% for the year 2019.

The effective income tax rate for 2018 reflected the final 2018 adjustments to the provisional amounts recorded in 2017 under the Tax Act of $75 million net tax cost. Excluding the 2018 impact of the Tax Act and impairment charges, the effective income tax rate was 22.9% for the year 2018.

Excluding these current year and prior year items, the lower effective income tax rate for 2018 primarily reflected a benefit from a change in tax reserves as a result of global audit progression, as well as lower tax costs in 2018 related to ongoing taxes under the Tax Act.

Consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets, net of valuation allowance, of

$5.3 billion

in

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Recently issued accounting standards are included on page 39 of this Form 10-K.

CASH FLOWS

The Company generates significant cash from its operations and has substantial credit availability and capacity to fund operating and discretionary spending such as capital expenditures, debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases.

Cash provided by operations totaled $8.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.1 billion or 17%. Free cash flow was $5.7 billion in 2019, an increase of $1.5 billion or 36%. The Company’s free cash flow conversion rate was 95% in 2019 and 71% in 2018 (see reconciliation in Exhibit 12). Cash provided by operations increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and lower income tax payments. In 2018, cash provided by operations totaled $7.0 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion or 25% compared with 2017, primarily due to lower tax payments.

Cash used for investing activities totaled $3.1 billion in 2019, an increase of $616 million compared with 2018.  The increase was primarily due to the Company’s strategic acquisitions of a real estate entity, Dynamic Yield and Apprente, partly offset by lower capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities totaled $2.5 billion in 2018, an increase of $3.0 billion compared with 2017. The increase was primarily due to lower proceeds from the sale of restaurant businesses in 2018 including the comparison to the proceeds received in 2017 associated with the sale of the Company's businesses in China and Hong Kong, as well as higher capital expenditures.

Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.0 billion in 2019, a decrease of $955 million compared with 2018, primarily due to net debt activity.  Cash used for financing activities totaled $5.9 billion in 2018, an increase of $639 million compared with 2017, primarily due to higher treasury stock purchases.

The Company’s cash and equivalents balance was $899 million and $866 million at year end 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition to cash and equivalents on hand and cash provided by operations, the Company can meet short-term funding needs through its continued access to commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements.

RESTAURANT DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

In

2019

, the Company opened

1,231

restaurants and closed

391

restaurants. In 2018, the Company opened 1,081 restaurants and closed 467 restaurants.

Systemwide restaurants at year end

of the restaurants at year-end

2019

were franchised, including

95%

in the U.S.,

84%

in International Operated Markets and

98%

in the International Developmental Licensed Markets.

Capital expenditures decreased $348 million or 13% in 2019 primarily due to lower reinvestment in existing restaurants, partly offset by an increase in new restaurant openings that required the Company's capital. Capital expenditures increased $888 million or 48% in 2018, primarily due to reinvestment in existing restaurants (including investment in EOTF).

McDonald's Corporation

Capital expenditures

(1)

Primarily corporate equipment and other office-related expenditures

New restaurant investments in all years were concentrated in markets with strong returns and/or opportunities for long-term growth. Average development costs vary widely by market depending on the types of restaurants built and the real estate and construction costs within each market. These costs, which include land, buildings and equipment, are managed through the use of optimally-sized restaurants, construction and design efficiencies, as well as leveraging the Company's global sourcing network and best practices. Although the Company is not responsible for all costs for every restaurant opened, total development costs for new traditional McDonald’s restaurants in the U.S. averaged approximately

$4.0 million

in

2019

.

The Company owned approximately

55%

and 50% of the land for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end

2019

and 2018, respectively, and approximately

80%

of the buildings for restaurants in its consolidated markets at year-end

2019

and 2018.

SHARE REPURCHASES AND DIVIDENDS

In 2019, the Company returned approximately $8.6 billion to shareholders through a combination of shares repurchased and dividends paid, marking the achievement of the Company's targeted return of $25 billion for the three-year period ended 2019.

Shares repurchased and dividends

In July 2017, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding stock, with no specified expiration date. In 2019, approximately 25.0 million shares were repurchased for $5.0 billion, bringing total purchases under the program to approximately 74.5 million shares or $12.9 billion. In December 2019, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the 2017 program and replaced it with a new share repurchase program, effective January 1, 2020, that authorized the purchase of up to $15 billion of the Company's outstanding common stock with no specified expiration date.

The Company has paid dividends on its common stock for 44 consecutive years and has increased the dividend amount every year. The 2019 full year dividend of

$4.73

per share reflects the quarterly dividend paid for each of the first three quarters of $1.16 per share, with an increase to $1.25 per share paid in the fourth quarter. This 8% increase in the quarterly dividend equates to a $5.00 per share annual dividend and reflects the Company’s confidence in the ongoing strength and reliability of its cash flow. As in the past, future dividend amounts will be considered after reviewing profitability expectations and financing needs, and will be declared at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors.

FINANCIAL POSITION AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

TOTAL ASSETS

Total assets increased

$14.7 billion

or

45%

in

2019

, primarily due to the addition of the Lease Right-of-Use Asset, Net, which was recorded upon adoption of ASC 842 effective January 1, 2019. Refer to the Lease Accounting section under Recent Accounting Pronouncements on page 39

for additional information on ASC 842. Net property and equipment increased

$1.3 billion

in 2019, primarily due to capital expenditures, partly offset by depreciation. Net property and equipment and the Lease Right-of-Use Asset, Net represented over 50% and approximately 30%, respectively, of total assets at year-end. Approximately 93% of total assets were in the U.S. and International Operated Markets at year-end 2019.
