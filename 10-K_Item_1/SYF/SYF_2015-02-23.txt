ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Company

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the United States. Our roots in consumer finance trace back to 1932, and today we are the largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States based on purchase volume and receivables. We provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our “partners.” Through our partners’ approximately338,000locations across the United States and Canada, and their websites and mobile applications, we offer their customers a variety of credit products to finance the purchase of goods and services. During 2014, we financed$103.1 billionof purchase volume, and at December 31, 2014, we had$61.3 billionof loan receivables and64.3 millionactive accounts. Our active accounts represent a geographically diverse group of both consumers and businesses, with an average FICO score of715for consumer active accounts at December 31, 2014. Our business has been profitable and resilient, including through the recent U.S. financial crisis and ensuing years. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had net earnings of$2.1 billionand $2.0 billion, respectively, representing a return on assets of3.2% and 3.5%, respectively.

Our business benefits from longstanding and collaborative relationships with our partners, including some of the nation’s leading retailers and manufacturers with well-known consumer brands, such as Lowe’s, Walmart, Amazon and Ethan Allen. We believe our partner-centric business model has been successful because it aligns our interests with those of our partners and provides substantial value to both our partners and our customers. Our partners promote our credit products because they generate increased sales and strengthen customer loyalty. Our customers benefit from instant access to credit, discounts and promotional offers. We seek to differentiate ourselves through deep partner integration and our extensive marketing expertise. We have omni-channel (in-store, online and mobile) technology and marketing capabilities, which allow us to offer and deliver our credit products instantly to customers across multiple channels. For example, the purchase volume in our Retail Card platform from our online and mobile channels increased by$2.0 billion, or17.9%, to$12.7 billionin 2014.

Our revenue activities are managed through three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards and small- and medium-sized business credit products. Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology.

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. Through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”), money market accounts and savings accounts, under our Optimizer+Plusbrand. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have expanded and continue to expand our online direct banking operations to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. We had$35.0 billionin deposits at December 31, 2014.














Our Value Proposition

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We offer strong value propositions to both our partners and our customers.

Our Value Proposition







Value to Our Partners

Our consumer finance programs deliver the following benefits to our partners:

•Increased sales.Our programs drive increased sales for our partners by providing instant credit with an attractive value proposition (which may include discounts, promotional financing and customized loyalty rewards). Based on our research and experience in our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we believe average sales per customer in these platforms are generally higher for customers who use our cards compared to consumers who do not. In Payment Solutions, the availability of promotional financing is important to the consumer’s decision to make purchases of “big-ticket” items and a driver of retailer selection. In CareCredit, the availability of credit can also have a substantial influence over consumer spending with a significant number of consumers indicating in our research that they would postpone or forego all or a portion of their desired healthcare procedures or services if credit was not available through their healthcare providers.

•Strengthened customer loyalty.Our programs benefit our partners through strengthened customer loyalty. Our Retail Card customers have had their cards an average of7years at December 31, 2014. We believe customer loyalty drives repeat business and additional sales. Our active Retail Card accounts at December 31, 2014 made an average of more than12purchases per account during the year ended December 31, 2014. In our Payment Solutions platform, 26% of purchase volume in 2014 was from existing customers through repeat purchases at our individual Payment Solution partners, as well as from the use of certain cards within industry-specific networks comprised of multiple Payment Solutions partners. Our CareCredit customers can use their card at any provider within our provider network, which we believe is an important source of new business to our providers, and 47% of CareCredit purchase volume in 2014 was from existing customers reusing their card at one or more providers.










•Enhanced marketing.We have developed significant marketing expertise that we share with our partners, including through dedicated on-site teams, a national field sales force and experts who reside in our marketing centers of excellence. We believe this expertise is of substantial value to our partners in increasing sales and profitability. Our omni-channel capabilities allow us to market our credit products wherever our partners offer their products. Our customer relationship management (“CRM”) and data analytics capabilities allow us to track customer responsiveness to different marketing strategies, which helps us target marketing messages and promotional offers to our partners’ customers. In Payment Solutions, our dedicated industry-focused sales and marketing teams bring substantial retailer marketing expertise to our smaller retailer and merchant partners. These partners benefit from our research on how to increase store traffic with various promotional offerings. We also provide them with website and e-commerce capabilities that many could not afford to develop on their own.

•Additional economic benefits.Our programs provide economic benefits to our partners in addition to increasing sales. Our Retail Card partners typically benefit from retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to them once the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually-defined threshold. These shared economics enhance our partners’ engagement with us and provide an incentive for partners to support our programs. In addition, for most of our partners, our credit programs reduce costs by eliminating the interchange fees for in-store purchases that would otherwise be paid when general purpose credit cards or debit cards are used. Our programs also allow our partners to avoid the risks and administrative costs associated with carrying an accounts receivable balance for their customers, and this is particularly attractive to many of our CareCredit partners.

Value to Our Customers

Our consumer finance programs deliver the following benefits to our customers:

•Instant access to credit.We offer qualified customers instant access to credit at the point of sale and across multiple channels. Our Retail Card programs provide financing for frequent purchases with attractive program benefits, including, in the case of our Dual Card, the convenience of a general purpose credit card. Payment Solutions and CareCredit offer promotional financing that enables qualified customers to make major purchases, including, in the case of CareCredit, elective healthcare procedures or services that typically are not covered by insurance.

•Attractive discounts, promotional terms and loyalty rewards.We believe our programs provide substantial value to our customers through attractive discounts, promotional terms and loyalty rewards. Retail Card customers typically benefit from first purchase discounts (e.g., 10% or more off the purchase price when a new account is opened) and discounts or loyalty rewards when their card is used to make subsequent purchases from our partners. Our Retail Card customers typically earn rewards based on the amount of their purchases from our partners at a rate which is generally higher than the reward rate on general purpose cash back credit cards. Our Payment Solutions and CareCredit customers typically benefit from promotional financing such as interest-free periods on purchases. These types of promotions typically are not available to consumers when they use a general purpose credit card outside of introductory offer periods.

•Ability to obtain separate financing for major purchases.We believe many consumers prefer to obtain separate financing for major purchases or category expenditures rather than accessing available borrowing capacity under their general purpose credit cards or using cash. We believe our customers also value the ability to compartmentalize, budget and track their spending and borrowing through separate financing for a major purchase.










Our Industry

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We believe our business is well positioned to benefit from the following favorable industry trends:

•Improvements in consumer spending and credit utilization.Consumer spending has increased as U.S. economic conditions and consumer confidence continue to recover from the recent financial crisis. The U.S. consumer payments industry, which consists of credit, debit, cash, check and electronic payments, is projected to grow by 27% from 2013 to 2018 (from $8.9 trillion in 2013 to $11.4 trillion in 2018) according to The Nilson Report (December 2014). According to that report, credit card payments are expected to account for the majority of the growth of the U.S. consumer payments industry. Credit card payments accounted for $2.5 trillion or 27.8% of U.S. consumer payments volume in 2013 and are expected to grow to $4.1 trillion or 36.0% of U.S. consumer payments volume in 2018. Credit card spending is growing as a percentage of total consumer spending, driven in part by the growth of online and mobile purchases.

•Improvements in U.S. household finances.U.S. household finances have recovered substantially since the financial crisis. According to the Federal Reserve Board, the average U.S. household’s debt service ratio is better than pre-crisis levels, having improved to9.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2014 from 13.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2007. According to the Federal Reserve Board, aggregate U.S. household net worth also has increased, from $66.8 trillion at December 31, 2007 to $81.3 trillion at September 30, 2014.

•Growth of direct banking and deposit balances.According to 2012 and 2014 American Bankers Association surveys, the percentage of customers who prefer to do their banking via direct channels (internet, mail, phone and mobile) increased from 53% to 54% between 2010 and 2014, while those who prefer branch banking declined from 25% to 21% over the same period. This preference for direct banking has been evidenced by robust growth in direct deposits. U.S. direct deposits increased by 48%, from $359 billion at December 31, 2010 to $532 billion at September 30, 2014, according to data for 17 surveyed banks from SNL Financial, a financial institutions data and analysis provider.

Competitive Strengths

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our business has a number of competitive strengths, including the following:

•Large, diversified and well established consumer finance franchise.Our business is large and diversified with64.3 millionactive accounts at December 31, 2014 and a partner network with approximately338,000locations across the United States and in Canada as of December 31, 2014. At December 31, 2014, we had$61.3 billionin total loan receivables, and we are the largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States based on purchase volume and receivables according to The Nilson Report (April 2014). We have built large scale operations that support each of our sales platforms, and we believe our extensive partner network, with its broad geographic reach and diversity by industry, provides us with a distribution capability that is difficult to replicate. We believe the scale of our business and resulting operating efficiencies also contribute significantly to our success and profitability. In addition, we believe our partner-centric model, including our distribution capability, could lend itself to geographic expansion.

•Partner-centric model with long-standing and stable relationships.Our business is based on a partner-centric, business-to-business model. Our ability to establish and maintain deep, collaborative relationships with our partners is a core skill that we have developed through decades of experience, and we have more than 1,000 dedicated employees, most of whom are co-located with our partners, to help drive the growth of our partners’ sales and our share of their sales. At December 31, 2014, the average length of our relationship for our 40 largest programs across all platforms, which accounted in aggregate for73.9% of our platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, is15years. From these same 40 programs,67.2% of our platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was generated under programs with current contractual terms that continue through at least January 1, 2017. A diverse and growing group of more than200,000partners accounted for the remaining26.1% of our platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.










•Deeply integrated technology across multiple channels.Our proprietary technology is deeply integrated with our partners’ systems and processes, which enables us to provide customized credit products to their customers at the point of sale across multiple channels. Our technologies enable customers to apply for credit at the point of sale in store, online or on a mobile device and, if approved, purchase instantly. Our online and mobile technologies are capable of being seamlessly integrated into our partners’ systems to enable our customers to check their available credit line, manage their account, access our eChat online customer service and participate in the relevant partners’ loyalty rewards programs online and using mobile devices. In addition, in CareCredit, we have developed an extensive provider locator that helps to connect customers to our approximately186,000healthcare provider locations. This online locator received an average of over 600,000 hits per month in 2014, helping to drive incremental business for our provider partners. We believe that our continued investment in technology and mobile offerings will help us deepen our relationships with our existing partners, as well as provide a competitive advantage when seeking to win new business.

•Strong operating performance.For the year ended December 31, 2014, we have grown our purchase volume and loan receivables at9.9%and7.0%, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our net earnings were$2.1 billionand $2.0 billion, respectively, and our return on assets was3.2% and 3.5%, respectively. We were profitable throughout the recent U.S. financial crisis. We believe our ability to maintain profitability through various economic cycles is attributable to our rigorous underwriting process, strong pricing discipline, low cost to acquire new accounts, operational expertise and retailer share arrangements with our largest partners.

•Strong balance sheet and capital base.We have a strong capital base and a diversified and stable funding profile with access to multiple sources of funding, including a growing deposit platform at the Bank, securitized financings under well-established programs, bank facilities and the public unsecured debt markets. At December 31, 2014, we had an estimated fully phased-in Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of14.5%, and our business was funded with$35.0 billionof deposits at the Bank,$15.0 billionof securitized financings,$0.7 billionof transitional funding from the GECC Term Loan,$8.2 billionfrom the Bank Term Loan, and$3.6 billionof senior unsecured notes. At December 31, 2014, we had$12.9 billionof cash and short-term liquid investments (or17.1% of total assets), and an aggregate of$6.1 billionof undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs. At December 31, 2014, the combined total of our liquid assets and undrawn capacity equated to 25.2% of total assets. We also had, at the same date more than$25.0 billionof unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales.

•Experienced and effective risk management.We have an experienced risk management team and an enterprise risk management infrastructure that we believe enable us to effectively manage our risk. Our enterprise risk management function is designed to identify, measure, monitor and control risk, including credit, market, liquidity, strategic and operational risks. Our focus on the credit process is evidenced by the success of our business through multiple economic cycles. We control the credit criteria for all of our programs and issue credit only to consumers who qualify under those credit criteria. Our systems are integrated with our partners’ systems, and therefore we can use our proprietary credit approval processes to make credit decisions instantly at the point of sale and across all application channels in accordance with our underwriting guidelines and risk appetite. Our risk management strategies are customized by industry and partner, and we believe our proprietary decisioning systems and customized credit scores provide significant incremental predictive capabilities over standard credit bureau-based scores alone. In addition, we have an extensive compliance program, and we have invested, and will continue to invest, in enhancing our regulatory compliance capabilities.

•High quality and diverse asset base.Our consumer active accounts had an average FICO score of715, and our total loan receivables (including loan receivables held for sale) had a weighted average consumer FICO score of698, in each case at December 31, 2014. In addition,72.2% of our portfolio’s loan receivables (including loan receivables held for sale) are from consumers with a FICO score of greater than 660 at December 31, 2014. Our over-30 day delinquency rate at December 31, 2014 is below 2007 pre-financial crisis levels. We have a seasoned customer base with35.0% of our loan receivables (including loan receivables held for sale) at December 31, 2014 associated with accounts that have been open for more than five years. Our portfolio is also diversified by geography, with receivables balances broadly reflecting the U.S. population distribution.










•Experienced management team and business built on GE culture.Our senior management team, including key members who helped us successfully navigate the financial crisis, is continuing to lead our Company following the initial public offering of our common stock (the “IPO”). We have operated as a largely standalone business within GECC, with our own sales, marketing, risk management, operations, collections, customer service and compliance functions. Our business has been built on GE’s culture and heritage, with a strong emphasis on our partners and customers, a rigorous use of metrics and analytics, a disciplined approach to risk management and compliance and a focus on continuous improvement and strong execution.

Our Business and Growth Strategy

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We intend to grow our business and increase our profitability by building on our financial and operating strengths and capitalizing on projected favorable industry trends, as well as by pursuing a number of important growth strategies for our business, including the following:

•Increase customer penetration at our existing partners.We believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our business by increasing the usage of our cards in each of our sales platforms. In Retail Card, based on sales data provided by our partners, we have increased penetration of our partners’ aggregate sales in each of the last three years. For the year ended December 31, 2013, penetration of our Retail Card partners’ sales ranged from1% to over 45%, and the aggregate sales of all Retail Card partners were over $550 billion, which we believe represents a significant opportunity for potential growth. We believe there is also a significant market opportunity for us to increase our penetration in Payment Solutions and CareCredit.

•Attract new partners.We seek to attract new partners by both launching new programs and acquiring existing programs from our competitors. In Retail Card, which is typically characterized by longer-term, exclusive relationships, we added three new Retail Card partners from January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014. We also entered into an agreement with an additional Retail Card partner, BP, for which we expect the associated program to begin in mid-2015. In Payment Solutions, where a significant number of our partners include independent dealers and merchants that enter into separate arrangements with us, we increased our total partners from approximately59,000at December 31, 2011 to approximately63,000at December 31, 2014. In CareCredit, where we attract new healthcare provider partners largely by leveraging our endorsements from professional associations and healthcare consultants, we increased the number of partner locations from approximately154,000at December 31, 2011 to approximately186,000at December 31, 2014. We believe there is a significant opportunity to attract new partners in each of our platforms, including by adding additional merchants, dealers and healthcare providers under existing programs.

Our strategies to both increase penetration among our current partners and attract new partners include the following elements:

•Leverage technology to support our partners.Our business model is focused on supporting our partners by offering credit wherever they offer their products and services (i.e., in-store, online and on mobile devices). We intend to continue to make significant investments in online and mobile technologies, which we believe will lead to new accounts, increased sales and deeper relationships with our existing partners and will give us an advantage when competing for new partners. We intend to continue to roll out the capability for consumers to apply for our products via their mobile devices, receive an instant credit decision and obtain immediate access to credit, and to deliver targeted rewards and promotions to our customers via their mobile devices for immediate use. We also expect to leverage emerging mobile payment system technologies. For example, through our participation in the Apple Pay program, we can place Dual Cards in Apple Pay for our participating partners who desire to have their cards in this wallet program, and we have invested in mobile platforms LoopPay and GPShopper.










•Capitalize on our advanced data, analytics and customer relationship management capabilities.We believe that our ongoing efforts to expand our data and analytics capabilities help differentiate us from our competitors. We have access to a vast amount of data (such as our customers’ purchase patterns and payment histories) from our over115 millionopen accounts at December 31, 2014 and the hundreds of millions of transactions our customers make each year. Consistent with applicable privacy rules and regulations, we are developing new tools to assess this data to develop and deliver valuable insights and actionable analysis that can be used to improve the effectiveness of marketing strategies leading to incremental growth for both our partners and our business. Our recently enhanced CRM platform will utilize these insights and analysis to drive more relevant and timely offers to our customers via their preferred channels of communication. We believe the combination of our analytics expertise and extensive data access will drive greater partner engagement and increased sales, strengthen customer loyalty, and provide us a competitive advantage.

•Expand our integrated multi-tender loyalty programs.We are leveraging our extensive data analytics, loyalty experience and broad retail presence to launch multi-tender loyalty programs that enable customers to earn rewards from a partner, regardless of how they pay for their purchases (e.g., cash, private label or general purpose credit cards). By expanding our loyalty program capabilities beyond private label credit cards we can provide deeper insights to our partners about their customers, including spending patterns and shopping behaviors. Multi-tender loyalty programs will also provide us with access to non-cardholders, giving us the opportunity to grow our customer base by marketing our credit products to them and delivering a more compelling value proposition.

•Increase focus on small and mid-sized businesses.We currently offer private label credit cards and Dual Cards for small to mid-sized commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We are increasing our focus on marketing our commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers and are rolling out an improved customer experience for this product with enhanced functionality. Our loan receivables from business customers were$1.3 billionat December 31, 2014, and we believe our strategic focus on business customers will enable us to continue to attract new business customers and increase the diversity of our loan receivables.



•

Expand our direct banking activities.

In January 2013, we acquired the deposit business of MetLife, which is a direct banking platform that at the time of the acquisition had $6.0 billion in U.S. direct deposits and $0.4 billion in brokered deposits. Our U.S. direct deposits have grown significantly since the MetLife acquisition to

$19.7 billion

at December 31, 2014. A key part of our strategy is to continue to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding. The platform is highly scalable, allowing us to expand without the overhead expenses of a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to direct banking. According to 2012 and 2014 American Bankers Association surveys, the percentage of customers who prefer to do their banking via direct channels (i.e., internet, mail, phone and mobile) increased from 53% to 54% between 2010 and 2014, while those who prefer branch banking declined from 25% to 21% over the same period. To attract new deposits and retain existing ones, we have increased and continue to increase our advertising and marketing, are enhancing our loyalty program and are expanding mobile banking offerings. We also intend to introduce new deposit and credit products and enhancements to our existing products. These new and enhanced products may include the introduction of checking accounts, overdraft protection lines of credit, a bill payment account feature and Synchrony-branded debit and general purpose credit cards, as well as enhanced small business deposit accounts and expanded affinity offers.

Formation and Regulation of Synchrony

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Synchrony is a holding company for the legal entities that historically conducted GE’s North American retail finance business. Synchrony was incorporated in Delaware on September 12, 2003, but prior to April 1, 2013 conducted no business. During the period from April 1, 2013 to September 30, 2013, as part of a regulatory restructuring, substantially all of the assets and operations of GE’s North American retail finance business, including the Bank, were transferred to Synchrony. The remaining assets and operations of that business subsequently were transferred to Synchrony in 2014.










As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, as a large provider of consumer financial services, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB.

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association and therefore is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the “OCC”), which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC.

For a discussion of the regulation of the Company and the Bank, see “—Regulation.” For information regarding certain regulatory matters, including consent orders or assurances of discontinuances that we have entered into with the CFPB, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the Attorney General for the State of New York relating to our CareCredit platform, our debt cancellation product and sales practices and certain collection offers, see “—Regulation—Consumer Financial Services Regulation” and “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Changes to our methods of offering our CareCredit products could materially impact operating results.”

Our Initial Public Offering

____________________________________________________________________________________________

On August 5, 2014, we closed the IPO of 125 million shares of our common stock at a price to the public of $23.00 per share and on September 3, 2014, we issued an additional 3.5 million shares of our common stock pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters in the IPO. We received net proceeds from the IPO (including the underwriters’ option) of approximately $2.8 billion.

GE Ownership and Our Separation from GE

____________________________________________________________________________________________

GE currently owns 100% of the common stock of GECC. GECC currently owns 100% of the common stock of GECFI and GECFI currently owns 84.6% of our common stock.

Steps to Our Separation from GE.On November 15, 2013, GE announced that it planned a staged exit from our business, consistent with its strategy of reducing GECC’s percentage of GE’s total earnings and increasing GECC’s focus on its commercial lending and leasing businesses. GE’s exit from our business is expected to consist of three distinct, but inter-related steps described below.

•The IPO.The IPO was the first step in GE’s exit from our business. As a result of the IPO, GE reduced its beneficial ownership in us from 100% to 84.6%, and our total equity increased through receipt of the IPO net proceeds.

•Separation.The second step of GE’s exit from our business will involve GE’s disposition of all of its remaining shares of our stock through a Split-off (defined below) or one or more other transactions following the IPO, which disposition is referred to as the “Separation.”

•Form of Separation Transaction. GE has indicated that it expects to effect a split-off transaction by making a tax-free distribution of all of its remaining shares of our stock to electing GE stockholders in exchange for shares of GE’s common stock (the “Split-off”). GE may also decide to exit our business by selling or otherwise distributing or disposing of all or a portion of its shares of our stock in a different type of transaction. We do not expect that the form in which the Separation occurs (a Split-off or some other form of distribution or disposition) will have materially different implications for our profitability.

•Conditions to Separation. The Separation would be subject to various conditions, including receipt of any necessary bank regulatory and other approvals (as discussed below), the existence of satisfactory market conditions, and, in the case of the Split-off, a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as to certain issues relating to, and an opinion from tax counsel confirming, the tax-free treatment of the transaction to GE and its stockholders.










•GE SLHC Deregistration.The final step in GE’s exit from our business will be complete when the Federal Reserve Board determines that GE no longer controls us for regulatory purposes and releases GE from savings and loan holding company registration (the “GE SLHC Deregistration”).

Bank Regulatory Approvals Required for Separation and the GE SLHC Deregistration.In addition to GE’s application for the GE SLHC Deregistration, we will be required to file an application with, and receive approval from, the Federal Reserve Board to continue to be a savings and loan holding company and to retain ownership of the Bank following the Separation and the GE SLHC Deregistration. In reviewing and acting on our application, the Federal Reserve Board will consider a range of factors and has significant discretion. We do not expect the Federal Reserve Board to act on our application until, among other things, it has completed an in-depth review as to our preparedness to operate on a standalone basis, independently of GE, and is satisfied with the results. We anticipate that this review will not begin until after we have filed our application and will require a considerable period of time. We are taking and will continue to take significant steps in order to prepare to operate on a standalone basis, independently from GE, including the following:

•Increase capital and liquidity levels.All of the net proceeds from the IPO were used to significantly increase our capital levels and, together with the net proceeds from the 2014 issuance of senior unsecured notes, the GECC Term Loan and the Bank Term Loan and after repayment of GECC related party debt (as described below), our liquidity levels. In connection with our application to the Federal Reserve Board and the Separation, we expect to continue to increase our capital and liquidity levels by, among other things, retaining net earnings and by not paying a dividend or returning capital through stock repurchases until our application to the Federal Reserve Board is approved. We will also seek to continue to increase our liquidity through growth of our direct deposits and other funding sources, including unsecured debt. At December 31, 2014, we had an estimated fully phased-in Basel III Tier 1 common ratio of14.5%, and we had liquidity consisting of$12.9 billionof cash and short-term liquid investments (or17.1% of total assets) and an aggregate of$6.1 billionof undrawn committed capacity under our securitization programs. At December 31, 2014, the combined total of our liquid assets and undrawn capacity equated to 25.2% of total assets.

•Establish and expand standalone operations and infrastructure.We are currently establishing or significantly expanding, and expect to continue to establish or expand, our standalone corporate governance, risk management, capital planning, treasury, information technology, compliance, regulatory, internal audit and other control operations and infrastructure. Although we will continue to receive certain services from GE on a transitional basis, we expect to reduce our reliance on these services in connection with our application to the Federal Reserve Board and the Separation, replacing such services with those provided by unaffiliated third parties or with our own capabilities. We may be required to operate without receiving any of these services from GE prior to the Separation.

•Reduce or eliminate funding provided by GECC.In connection with the IPO, we repaid all then-outstanding related party debt owed to GECC and its affiliates (approximately $8.0 billion), while entering into a GECC Term Loan of $1.5 billion. During 2014, we prepaid an aggregate of $845 million of the GECC Term Loan, and subsequent to December 31, 2014, made additional prepayments in the aggregate of $206 million, including through the use of proceeds from additional third-party borrowings. Following these prepayments, the indebtedness outstanding under the GECC Term Loan was $449 million. We expect that, in connection with our application to the Federal Reserve Board and the Separation, we will continue to prepay part or substantially all of the remaining outstanding related party debt owed to GECC under the GECC Term Loan.

•Diversify funding sources.In addition to reducing the amount of outstanding related party debt owed to GECC, we intend to further diversify our funding sources by growing the amount of our direct deposits, by reducing the proportion of funding provided by brokered deposits, and by continuing to access the unsecured debt markets. The Federal Reserve Board may require us to take additional actions beyond the significant infrastructure expansion and other steps we are already planning and implementing and beyond what we are now anticipating.










Anticipated Timeframe for Separation and GE SLHC Deregistration.GE has indicated that it currently is targeting to complete the Separation in late 2015. We may not be prepared, or able to satisfy the Federal Reserve Board that we are prepared, to operate on a standalone basis, independent of GE, by that time. More generally, the conditions to any transaction involved in the Separation may not be satisfied in late 2015 or thereafter, or GE may decide for any reason not to consummate the Separation in late 2015 or thereafter. Further, GE’s willingness to proceed with the Separation may effectively be conditioned on its obtaining the necessary determination by the Federal Reserve Board that the GE SLHC Deregistration will occur upon Separation, although the Separation and the GE SLHC Deregistration need not coincide. For this reason, any delays in obtaining the GE SLHC Deregistration may delay the consummation of the Separation.

Anticipated Costs Associated with Separation and GE SLHC Deregistration.We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant additional expenses to operate as a fully independent public company. For a discussion of these expenses, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Business Trends and Conditions,” and “—Services and Funding Provided by GE.”

For a discussion of certain risks associated with Separation and the GE SLHC Deregistration, including risks related to anticipated timing and costs, see “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Separation from GE.”

Our Sales Platforms

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We offer our credit products through three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Set forth below is a summary of certain information relating to our Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit platforms:

Retail Card

Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. Retail Card accounted for$6.9 billion, or68.3% of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard (i.e., non-promotional) terms.

Retail Card’s platform revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, plus other income, less retailer share arrangements. Other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned on Dual Card transactions (when the card is used outside of our partners’ sales channels) and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments.










Retail Card Partners

We have ongoing Retail Card programs with19national and regional retailers, which have approximately33,000retail locations and include department stores, specialty retailers, mass merchandisers, multi-channel electronic retailers, online retailers and oil and gas retailers. At December 31, 2014, we also had Retail Card programs with three additional retailers with program agreements that have expired or otherwise will not extend beyond their current contractual expiration dates in 2015 representing 1.3% of our total Retail Card loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, at December 31, 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also entered into an agreement with an additional Retail Card partner, BP, for which we expect the associated program to begin in mid-2015. At December 31, 2014, nearly 90% of Retail Card loan receivables, including loan receivables held for sale, were under program agreements with an expiration date in 2018 or beyond. Set forth below is certain information regarding the ongoing 19 Retail Card partners at December 31, 2014:

(1)In years, at December 31, 2014.

Our ten largest Retail Card programs accounted in aggregate for59.8% of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our programs with JCPenney and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our total platform revenue and JCPenney, Lowe’s and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our total platform interest and fees and other income, in each case for the year ended December 31, 2014. We also have programs with Sam’s Club, a subsidiary of Walmart, pursuant to separate program agreements. For purposes of the information provided in this paragraph with respect to Walmart, the platform revenue and interest and fees and other income from the Sam’s Club programs have not been included.

Our Retail Card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners. Although the terms of the agreements are partner-specific, and may be amended from time to time, under a typical program agreement our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers, but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria. We generally own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Other key provisions in the Retail Card program agreements include:










Term.Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years. Most program agreements have renewal clauses that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner. We typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates. Since January 1, 2012, we have extended the duration of many of our Retail Card program agreements to a new expiration date in 2017 or beyond. Set forth below is certain information regarding the current scheduled expiration dates of our ongoing 19 Retail Card partner programs:





(1)Percentages stated as a proportion of total Retail Card loan receivables (including loan receivables held for sale) at December 31, 2014.

(2)Excludes three program agreements that have expired or otherwise will not be extended beyond their contractual expiration dates in 2015, which represented 1.3% of our total Retail Card loan receivables (including loan receivables held for sale) at December 31, 2014.

(3)Program agreements with one of our partners, covering most of the financing we provide to that partner’s customers, were extended from 2016 to beyond 2021. Program agreements covering the remaining financing provided to the partner’s customers (most of which we believe will be extended) represent$331 millionof loan receivables at December 31, 2014 and are included as part of the 2016 information.

(4)Includes one program agreement that we do not expect to extend beyond its contractual expiration date in 2016, which represented 2.5% of our total loan receivables (including loan receivables held for sale) at December 31, 2014.

(5)In February 2015,we extended our program agreement with Amazon. The contractual expiration date following the extension of this program agreement is reflected in the above chart.

Exclusivity.The program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or co-branded credit cards during the term of the agreement.

Retailer share arrangements.Most of our Retail Card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually-defined threshold. Economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses). We may also provide additional economic benefits to our partners such as a signing bonus, royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts. All of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products.

Other economic terms.In addition to the retailer share arrangements, the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program, it sets the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded, the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product (such as opportunities to receive double rewards point for purchases made on a Retail Card product), and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program.










Termination.The program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration. Our program agreements generally permit us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its obligations. Some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers, we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, or we are not adequately capitalized, or if certain force majeure events occur or certain changes in our ownership (which we do not believe will be triggered by the Split-off) occur. Certain of these program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its financial condition. Historically, these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised. Some of our program agreements provide that, upon termination or expiration, our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with respect to its program at fair market value or a stated price, including all related customer data.

Acquiring New Retail Card Partners

We seek to partner with medium to large, financially strong retailers who have a national or regional footprint and a desire to grow their business through effective consumer financing programs. Our business development team proactively targets and engages with potential partners that either do not have a card program or may be receptive to an opportunity for us to acquire their existing program. The team responds to competitive requests for proposals (“RFPs”) and informal inquiries initiated by retailers. From January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2014, we added three new Retail Card partners.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also entered into an agreement with an additional Retail Card partner, BP, for which we expect the associated program to begin in mid-2015.

Acquiring and Marketing to Retail Card Customers

We work directly with our partners using their distribution network, communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their customers and potential customers. We believe our presence at our partners’ points of sale and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer that is already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at significantly lower costs than general purpose card issuers, who typically market directly to consumers through mass mailings and advertising.

To acquire new customers, we collaborate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create marketing programs that promote our products for creditworthy customers. Frequently, our partners market the availability of credit as part of (and with little incremental cost to) the advertising for their goods and services. Our marketing programs include marketing offers (e.g., 10% off the customer’s first purchase) and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of channels, including in-store signage, online advertising, retailer website placement, associate communication, emails and text messages, direct mail campaigns, advertising circulars, and outside marketing via television, radio and print. We also employ our proprietary Quickscreen and eQuickscreen acquisition methods to make targeted pre-approved credit offers at the point-of-sale both in-store and online. Our Quickscreen and eQuickscreen technology allows us to run customer information we have obtained from our partners through our risk models in advance so that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners in-store or online point of sale we can make a credit offer instantly, if appropriate. Based on our experience, due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer, Quickscreen and eQuickscreen significantly outperform traditional direct-to-consumer pre-approved channels, such as direct mail or email, in response rate and dollar spending.

After a customer obtains one of our Retail Card products, our marketing programs encourage card utilization by continuing to communicate our products’ value propositions (such as, depending on the program, promotional financing offers, cardholder events, product discounts, dollar-off certificates, accountholder sales, reward points and offers, new product announcements and previews, and free or reduced cost gift wrapping, alteration or delivery services) through our partners’ distribution channels.

Through our CRM and data analytics teams, we track cardholder responsiveness to our marketing programs and use this research to target marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders based on their individual characteristics, such as length of relationship and spending pattern. For example, if a cardholder responds positively to a coupon sent by text message, we will tailor future marketing messages so that they are delivered by text message. Our ability to target marketing messages and promotions is enhanced for Dual Card programs because we receive, collect and analyze data on in-store and all other spending.










We also manage retail loyalty programs. These programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label or Dual Card. The merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder, accessed online, or may be immediately redeemable at the partner’s store. Other programs provide cash back or reward points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards. These loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty. In the future, we intend to offer loyalty programs to customers that utilize non-credit payment types such as cash, debit or check. These multi-tender loyalty programs will allow our partners to market to an expanded customer base, and allow us access to additional prospective cardholders.

In addition to our efforts to acquire and promote consumer cardholders, we are increasing our focus on small to mid-sized commercial customers. We offer these customers private label credit cards and Dual Cards that can be used at our Retail Card partners and are similar to our consumer offerings. We are also increasing our focus on marketing our commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product that supports a wide range of business customers.

Payment Solutions

Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering private label credit cards and installment loans. Payment Solutions accounted for$1.6 billion, or15.5%, of our total platform revenue for year ended December 31, 2014. Substantially all of the credit extended in Payment Solutions is promotional financing.

Payment Solutions’ platform revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including “merchant discounts,” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest revenue associated with promotional financing. We offer three types of promotional financing: deferred interest (interest accrues during a promotional period and becomes payable if the full purchase amount is not paid off during the promotional period), no interest (no interest on a promotional purchase) and reduced interest (interest is assessed monthly at a promotional interest rate during the promotional period). As a result, during the promotional period we do not generate interest revenue or generate it at a lower rate, although we continue to generate fee income relating to late fees on required minimum payments.

Payment Solutions Partners

In Payment Solutions, we create customized credit programs for national and regional retailers, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and our own individually-branded industry programs, which are available to participating merchants, dealers and retail outlets to provide financing offers to their customers. Our programs include:

•programs with national and regional retailers and their related retail outlets;

•programs with manufacturers and the merchants and dealers (including franchisees) that sell the manufacturers’ products;

•programs with buying groups or industry associations and their participating member merchants and dealers; and

•individually-branded industry programs that we create and the networks of individual, unrelated merchants and dealers who participate in these programs.

At December 31, 2014, we had approximately63,000participating partners. These partners collectively have approximately119,000retail locations.










Set forth below is certain information regarding our ten largest Payment Solutions programs by platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014:

(1)In years, at December 31, 2014.

The average length of our relationship for our ten largest Payment Solutions programs is10years.

Payment Solutions’ platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 is diversified across seven retail markets: home furnishings/flooring (41.5%), electronics/appliances (20.9%), home specialty (11.4%), automotive (8.7%), power (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden) (7.7%), other retail (6.3%) and jewelry and other luxury items (3.5%). Payment Solutions is also diversified by program, with no one Payment Solutions program accounting for more than1.2% of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.

National and Regional Retailers and Manufacturers.For the Payment Solutions programs we have established with national and regional retailers and manufacturers, the terms of our program agreements typically are similar to the terms of our Retail Card program agreements in that we are the exclusive program provider of financing for the national or regional retailer or manufacturer with respect to the financing products we offer. The term of the program agreements generally run from three to five years and are subject to termination prior to the scheduled termination date by us or our partner for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its obligations. Some of these programs also permit our partner to terminate the program if we change certain key cardholder terms, elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, certain force majeure events occur, certain changes in our ownership occur, or there is a material adverse change in our financial condition. A few of these programs also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us (e.g., several months). Many of these program agreements have renewal clauses which allow the program agreement to be renewed for successive one or more year terms until terminated by us or our partner. We typically negotiate with program participants to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates.

We control credit criteria and issue credit cards or provide installment loans to customers who qualify under those credit criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Our Payment Solutions program agreements set forth the program’s economic terms, including the merchant discount applicable to each promotional finance offering. We typically do not pay fees to our Payment Solutions partners pursuant to any retailer share arrangements, but in some cases we pay a sign-up fee to a partner or provide volume based rebates on the merchant discount paid by the partner. In addition to the credit programs, we also process general purpose card transactions for some merchants and dealers under programs with manufacturers as their acquiring bank within most of the credit card network associations, for which we receive an interchange fee.










Buying Groups and Industry Associations.For the Payment Solutions programs we have established with buying groups and industry associations, such as the North American Home Furnishings Association, Jewelers of America and MEGA Group USA, the programs are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers, but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers. Under the terms of the program agreements, buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs. These arrangements may include sign-up fees and volume based incentives paid by us to the groups and their members. In addition to these credit programs, we also process general purpose card transactions for some merchants and dealers as their acquiring bank within most of the credit card network associations, for which we receive an interchange fee.

Individually-branded Programs.Our individually-branded Payment Solutions programs are focused on specific industries, where we create either company branded or company and partner branded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industry-specific network. For example, our CarCareONE program, comprised of merchants selling automotive parts, repair services and tires, covers18,000locations across the United States, and cards issued may be dual branded with CarCareONE and partners such as Midas, Michelin Tires or Pep Boys. Under the terms of these programs, we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer, and, in some cases, the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network.

Dealer Agreements.For the Payment Solutions programs we have established with manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and individually-branded programs described above, we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs. These agreements generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors. Our agreements generally continue until terminated by either party, with termination typically available to either party at will on 15 days’ written notice. Our dealer agreements set forth the economic terms associated with the program, including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing, and in some cases allow us to periodically change the fees we charge.

Acquiring New Payment Solutions Partners

Attracting new partners is a key element to the continued growth of our Payment Solutions platform. In Payment Solutions, we seek to partner with, and proactively target, sellers of “big-ticket” products or services (generally priced from $500 to $25,000) to consumers where our financing products provide strong incremental value to sellers and their customers. Our business development team also responds to RFPs initiated by retailers, manufacturers, industry groups and other organizations, and works within our existing programs to increase the number of partners participating in these programs. We also promote all of our programs through direct marketing activities such as industry trade publications, trade shows and sales efforts by dedicated internal and external sales teams, leveraging our existing partner network or through endorsements from manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Our broad array of point of sale technologies and quick enrollment process allow us to quickly and cost-effectively integrate new partners. From December 31, 2011 through December 31, 2014, we increased our total partners from approximately59,000to approximately63,000with new partners accounting for$1.0 billionin loan receivables at December 31, 2014.

Acquiring and Marketing to Payment Solutions Customers

Our Payment Solutions products are generally deeply embedded in our partners’ product offerings and our financing offers are therefore a key component of our partners’ marketing and growth strategies. Our breadth and scale enable us to bring substantial retailer marketing expertise to our smaller retailer and merchant partners. Similar to Retail Card, we help our partners acquire new customers by leveraging our significant marketing expertise to help them develop marketing programs that promote our products for customers through a variety of channels, including in-store signage, online advertising, retailer website placement, emails and text messages, direct mail campaigns, advertising circulars and print media/outside marketing via television, radio and print. In Payment Solutions, we also use our CRM and data analytics capabilities as described above for Retail Card.










CareCredit

CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology. CareCredit accounted for$1.6 billion, or16.2%, of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Substantially all of the credit extended in CareCredit is promotional financing.

We offer customers a CareCredit-branded private label credit card that may be used across our network of CareCredit providers. We generate revenue in CareCredit primarily from interest and fees on our credit products and from merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us for all or part of the cost of this promotional financing. We also process general purpose card transactions for some providers as their acquiring bank within most of the credit card network associations, for which we obtain an interchange fee.

CareCredit Partners

The vast majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers. The remainder are national and regional healthcare providers and manufacturers such as LCA-Vision, Heartland Dental, Starkey Laboratories and the Veterinary Centers of America (VCA Antech). At December 31, 2014, we had CareCredit agreements with approximately156,000healthcare providers. These partners collectively have approximately186,000locations. During 2014, over 156,000 of these locations either processed a CareCredit application or made a sale on a CareCredit credit card. No one CareCredit partner accounted for more than0.4% of our total platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. CareCredit’s platform revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 is diversified across five major specialties: dental (63.2%), veterinary (15.3%), cosmetic and dermatology (9.6%), vision (5.9%), audiology (2.6%) and other markets (3.4%).

We enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our CareCredit network. These provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our Payment Solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will on 15 days’ notice. There typically are no retailer share arrangements with partners in CareCredit.

Acquiring New CareCredit Partners

CareCredit includes a network of healthcare practitioners that provide elective procedures that generally are not covered by insurance. We screen potential partners using a variety of criteria, including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties, carries the appropriate licensing and certifications, and has a strong credit history. We also screen potential partners for reputational issues. We work with professional and other associations, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the products and services we offer. At December 31, 2014, we had relationships with over100professional and other associations (including the American Dental Association and the American Animal Hospital Association), manufacturers and buying groups, which endorse and promote our credit products to their members. Of these relationships, over60were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in, and volume under, the relevant program. We believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate, which our research in 2014 shows is89%. We also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail and advertising, and at trade shows. We have increased the number of our CareCredit partner locations from approximately154,000at December 31, 2011 to approximately186,000at December 31, 2014.

Acquiring and Marketing to CareCredit Customers

We market our products through our provider network by training our network providers on the advantages of CareCredit products and by making marketing materials available for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers. Our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pre-treatment consultation phase, including the option to apply for a CareCredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit. According to a 2014 survey of our CareCredit customers,48% indicated that they would have postponed or reduced scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider. Consumers can apply for our CareCredit products in the provider’s office, or online via the web or mobile device.










We also market our products to potential and existing customers directly through our web-based partner locator, which allows customers to search for healthcare service providers that accept the CareCredit credit card by desired geography and provider type. According to our records, our CareCredit partner locator averaged over 600,000 hits per month during the year ended December 31, 2014. We believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition. Our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of CareCredit card re-use across the network, with 47% of purchase volume across our CareCredit network during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting from repeat use at one or more providers.

Our Credit Products

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also offer a debt cancellation product.

The following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at December 31, 2014.

Credit Cards

Our credit card products are loans we extend through open-ended revolving credit card accounts. We offer two principal types of credit cards: private label credit cards and Dual Cards.

Private Label Credit Cards

Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe’s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., CarCareONE or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances.

Credit under a private label credit card typically is extended on either standard terms only, which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed non-promotional fixed and/or variable interest rate, or pursuant to a promotional financing offer, involving deferred interest, no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period. Promotional periods typically range between six and 48 months, but we may agree to longer terms with the partner. In almost all cases we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the cost of providing the promotional financing feature. The terms of these promotions vary by partner, but generally the longer the deferred interest, reduced interest or interest-free period, the greater the partner’s merchant discount. Some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate, rather than deferring or delaying interest charges.










In Retail Card, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only, and in Payment Solutions and CareCredit, credit under our private label credit cards typically is extended pursuant to a promotional financing offer. In CareCredit, standard rate financing generally applies to charges under $200.

We typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services through our payment system.

Most of our private label credit card business is in the United States. For some of our partners who have locations in Canada, we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in Canada and from customers in Canada.

Dual Cards

Our proprietary Dual Cards are general purpose credit cards that are co-branded with our partner’s own brand and may be used to make purchases of goods or services from our partner (functioning as a private label credit card) or purchases from others wherever cards from those card networks are accepted (functioning as a general purpose credit card) or cash advance transactions. We currently issue Dual Cards for use on the Visa and MasterCard networks and we currently have the ability to issue Dual Cards for use on the American Express and Discover networks.

We have been granted two U.S. patents relating to the process by which our Dual Cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations.

Credit extended under our Dual Cards typically is extended on standard terms only. Currently, only Retail Card offers Dual Cards. At December 31, 2014, we offered Dual Cards through14of our 19 continuing Retail Card programs. We expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer Dual Cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to Dual Cards.

Charges using a Dual Card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than in store or online from the partner.

We currently do not issue Dual Cards in Canada.

Loyalty Programs

We operate a number of loyalty programs in our Retail Card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with rewards in the form of merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card or Dual Card. Other programs provide cash back or reward points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards.

Terms and Conditions

As a general matter, the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time, although we seek to standardize the non-financial provisions consistently across all products. The terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

We assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened. Thereafter, we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time, at our discretion, based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay. To the extent required by law or regulation, we send a monthly billing statement to each customer who has an outstanding debit or credit balance.










For the vast majority of accounts, periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method, which results in daily compounding of periodic interest charges, subject to, at times, a grace period on new purchases. Cash advances are not subject to a grace period, and some credit card programs do not provide a grace period for promotional purchases. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts, including, as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement, cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment due by the required due date.

Typically, each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month. A customer may pay the total amount due at any time without penalty. We also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules, and to waive interest charges and/or fees.

Commercial Credit Products

We offer private label cards and co-branded cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers, and are rolling out an improved customer experience for this product with enhanced functionality. We offer commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the commercial customers of our Retail Card partners.

Installment Loans

In Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power segment. Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. The terms of our installment loans are governed by customer agreements and applicable laws and regulations.

Installment loans are assessed periodic interest charges using fixed interest rates. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on loan accounts, including late fees where a customer has not made the required payment by the required due date and returned payment fees.

Debt Cancellation Products

We offer a debt cancellation product to our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase this product are charged a monthly fee based on their ending balance on each billing statement. In return, the Bank will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. In October 2012, we ceased telesales of debt cancellation protection products and only offer a debt cancellation product online and, on a limited basis, by direct mail.

Direct Banking

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Through the Bank, we offer our customers a range of FDIC-insured deposit products directly through our Optimizer+plusplatform. The Bank also takes deposits through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. At December 31, 2014, we had$35.0 billionin deposits,$19.7 billionof which were direct deposits (which includes deposits from banks and financial institutions) and$15.3 billionof which were brokered deposits. Direct deposits were received from approximately150,000customers that had a total of over250,000accounts. Retail customers account for 97% of our direct deposits (by volume) and 99% of our accounts (by number), and commercial customers account for the remainder. The Bank had an89% retention rate on certificates of deposit balances up for renewal for the year ended December 31, 2014. FDIC insurance is provided for our deposit products up to applicable limits.










In January 2013, we acquired the deposit business of MetLife, which is a direct banking platform that at the time had $6.4 billion in deposits ($6.0 billion in direct deposits). The acquisition of this direct-to-consumer retail banking platform is a key part of our strategy to increase our deposit base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding going forward. Our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network. We expect growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits.

We are growing our direct banking operations and believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the consumer driven-shift from branch banking to direct banking. According to 2012 and 2014 American Bankers Association surveys, the percentage of customers who prefer to do their banking via direct channels (internet, mail, phone and mobile) increased from 53% to 54% between 2010 and 2014, while those who prefer branch banking declined from 25% to 21% over the same period.

Our deposit products include certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. We market our deposit products through multiple channels including our online, print and radio advertising. Customers can apply for, fund, and service their deposit accounts online or via phone. We have a dedicated staff within our call centers to service deposit accounts. Historically, we also offered a partner-branded prepaid re-loadable card product to the customers of a few of our Retail Card partners.

To attract new deposits and retain existing ones, we intend to introduce new deposit and credit products and enhancements to our existing products. These new and enhanced products may include the introduction of checking accounts, overdraft protection lines of credit, a bill payment account feature and Synchrony-branded debit and general purpose credit cards, as well as enhanced small business deposit accounts and expanded affinity offers. Our focus on deposit-taking and related branding efforts will also enable us to offer other branded direct-banking products more efficiently in the future.

Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (“FIS”) provides our platform for online retail deposits including a customer-facing servicing platform that customers can access via our marketing site. FIS also provides supplemental back office, IT production and IT development support for our direct banking operations.

We seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings from our competitors on the basis of brand, reputation, convenience, customer service and value. We have launched a sub-brand for our deposit products called Optimizer+plus, which emphasizes reliability, trust, security, convenience and attractive rates. Optimizer+plus Perksoffers rewards to customers based on their tenure or balance amounts, including reduced fees, travel offers and concierge telephone support.

Credit Risk Management

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us. Our credit risk arising from consumer credit products is generally highly diversified across over115 millionopen accounts at December 31, 2014, without significant individual exposures. We manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types.

Customer Account Acquisition

We have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners. We originate credit accounts through several different channels, including in-store, mail, internet, mobile, telephone and pre-approved solicitations. In addition, we have and may in the future acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners.










Regardless of the channel, in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit, we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures. In most cases, when applications are made in-store or by internet or mobile, the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately. We generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus. The credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score. The risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type. We periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance, and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk. Different scoring models may be used depending upon bureau type and account source.

We also apply additional application screens based on various inputs, including credit bureau information, to help identify potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval. We compare applicants’ names against the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), as well as screens that account for adherence to USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) and Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “CARD Act”) requirements, including ability to pay requirements.

We occasionally use pre-approved account solicitations for certain programs. Potential applicants are pre-screened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists, and qualified individuals receive a pre-approved credit offer by mail or email.

Acquired Portfolio Evaluation

Our risk management team evaluates each portfolio we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines. As part of this review, we receive data on the third-party accounts and loans, which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics, such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information. In addition, we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks. Finally, our risk management team must approve the acquisition, taking into account the results of our risk assessment process. Once assets are migrated to our systems, our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under “—Customer Account Management,” “—Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions” and “—Collections.”

Customer Account Management

We regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts. This ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with respect to its account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. To monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio (including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties), we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date. Proprietary risk models, together with the FICO scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly, are an integral part of our credit decision-making process. Depending on the duration of the customer’s account, risk profile and other performance metrics, the account may be subject to a range of account actions, including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits.

Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions

Once an account has been opened, when a credit card is used to make a purchase in-store at one of our partners’ locations or online, point-of-sale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system, which allows for real-time updating of accounts. Each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system, which takes into account a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined, and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted.










Fraud Investigation

We provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings, new account fraud and transactional fraud. We have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern. Our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers. We also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud. Recently, we began implementing embedded security chip technology (such as the so-called “EMV chips”) with some of our partners.

Collections

All monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts. Collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due. The nature and the timing of the initial contact, typically a personal call, e-mail, text message or letter, are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits.

We re-evaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques, including internal collection activities and use of external vendors, as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent. We limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes, the imposition of credit limits and criteria-based account suspension and revocation processes. In certain situations, we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules, decrease interest rates and/or waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us.

Customer Service

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners. Our customers can contact us via phone, mail, email, eService and eChat. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we handled approximately209 millioncalls.

We assign a dedicated toll-free customer service phone number to each of our Retail Card programs. Our Payment Solutions customers access customer service through one general purpose toll-free customer service phone number (except for a few large Payment Solutions programs, which have dedicated toll-free numbers). Our CareCredit platform has its own, dedicated toll-free customer service phone number. We also have dedicated toll-free customer service phone numbers for our deposit business.

We service all programs through our nine domestic and two off-shore call centers. We also provide phone-based customer service through a third-party vendor. Our off-shore facilities are located in Hyderabad, India and Manila, Philippines. We blend domestic and off-shore locations and seek optimal cost as an important part of our servicing strategy. Customer service for cards issued to customers in Canada is supported through agents based in the United States.

Given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls, we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across all of our sites. These centers of excellence consist of quality assurance, customer experience, training, workforce and capacity planning, surveillance and process control, tactical operations center, business solutions and technology support.

Production Services

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our production services organization oversees a number of services, including:

•payment processing (more than440 millionpaper and electronic payments in 2014);

•embossing and mailing credit cards (approximately54 millioncards in 2014);










•printing and mailing and eService delivery of credit card statements (more than640 millionpaper and electronic statements in 2014); and

•other letters mailed or sent electronically (approximately88 millionin 2014).

All United States customer payments received by mail are processed at one of two centers located in Atlanta, Georgia and Longwood, Florida, both of which are operated by the Bank. United States credit card statement printing and mailing, card embossing and mailing and letter production and mailing for customers is provided through outsourced services with First Data Corporation (“First Data”). While these services are outsourced, we monitor and maintain oversight of these other services. First Data also produces our statements and other mailings for deposit customers.

Card production embossing and mailing and statement printing and mailing services related to cards issued to customers in Canada are outsourced to Canadian suppliers.

Technology

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We leverage information technology and deliver products and services that meet the needs of our partners and enable us to operate our business efficiently. The integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition, enabling, among other things, customers to “apply and buy” at the point of sale, and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee. A key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative, efficient, flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing, risk management, account acquisition and account management, customer service, and new product development. We believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities, reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Consequently, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our business needs.

As part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technologies, we may either develop these capabilities internally or rely on third-party providers. We rely on third-party providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and, in some cases, architecture, designed by us. These relationships include: First Data for our credit card transaction processing and production, and FIS for retail banking.

To protect our systems and technologies, and the consumer information stored on our systems, we employ security, backup and recovery systems and generally require the same of our most significant third-party service providers. Our information security policy and supporting standards and procedures (including multiple layers of security controls), are designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of consumer data and ensure that access is limited to those with a business need. We evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement. We have implemented a security program that is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store, process or have access to material consumer data.

In addition, we perform, or cause to be performed, a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services in an effort to reduce the risk that any attacks on these platforms, systems and applications are successful. We also perform periodic test and validation of our disaster recovery plans and require certain of our third parties to do so as well. In connection with the Separation, we must migrate, and in some cases, establish with third parties, key parts of our technology infrastructure, including our data centers.










Competition

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our industry is highly competitive and is becoming more competitive. We compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as Alliance Data, American Express, Capital One, Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, potential partners’ own in-house financing capabilities. We compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing expertise, service levels, product and service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation. In addition, some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account approval), customer service and collections, and other core banking responsibilities that we retain.

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct banking competitors. We compete for deposits with traditional banks, and in seeking to grow our direct banking business we compete with other banks that have direct banking models similar to ours, such as Ally Financial, American Express, Capital One 360 (ING), Discover, Nationwide, Sallie Mae and USAA. Competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors.

Intellectual Property

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We use a variety of methods, such as trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property. We also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures. Our brands are important assets, and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation. Following the IPO, we launched our new brand, “Synchrony,” and expect to spend significant amounts over the next few years promoting our new brand.

We have two patents for proprietary methods related to our Dual Cards. The patents were issued in 2005 and 2010 and expire in 2023 and 2027, respectively.

We recently filed trademark applications to protect our new name in the United States and certain other countries, and the applications are pending.










Employees

____________________________________________________________________________________________

At December 31, 2014, we had approximately 11,000 full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any material employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. We also have relationships with third-party call center providers in the United States and other countries that provided us with additional contractors for customer service, collections and other functions.

Risk Management

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Strong risk management is at the core of our business strategy and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk we encounter, namely credit, market, liquidity, operational and strategic risk. Historically, the risk function for substantially all of our operations has been managed through the risk management function at the Bank level. We established an overall risk management function at the Company level in connection with the IPO, building on our extensive, well-established risk management experience and processes at the Bank. The Bank maintains a substantial risk management function that is coordinated with our overall risk management. The following is a description of our overall risk management function.

As described in greater detail below under “—Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities,” we manage our enterprise risk using an integrated framework that includes board-level oversight, administration by a group of cross-functional management committees, and day-to-day implementation by a dedicated risk management team led by the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). The Risk Committee of our board of directors has responsibility for the oversight of our risk management program, and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management. Several management committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering our risk management program, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the “ERMC”), the Management Committee (the “MC”) and the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the “ALCO”). This committee-focused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied cross-functionally to all major decisions, including development of processes, policies and controls used by the CRO and risk management team to execute our risk management philosophy.

Our enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks in our business activities are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and controlled. Our approach in executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging our strong credit risk culture to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework, a comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework.

Risk Categories

Our risk management is organized around five major risk categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and strategic risk. We evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us (including the Bank and other subsidiaries) by assessing the partner and customer, financial, reputational, and legal and regulatory impacts.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation. Credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk, principally from our partners. Consumer credit risk is one of the most significant risks we face. See “—Credit Risk Management” for a description of our customer credit risk management procedures.










Market Risk

Market risk is the risk of loss due to changes in external market variables such as interest rates and asset values. Our principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on our economic value, capitalization levels and earnings. Market risk is managed through our ALCO processes, and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits for both earnings at risk and the economic value of equity sensitivity analysis. The ALCO reviews market risk scenario results on a monthly basis, and interest rate risk appetite metrics are reviewed on a quarterly basis by the ERMC and our board of directors.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet contractual obligations and support planned growth. Our primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us, even in times of stress or market disruption, to fund our existing assets and meet all of our liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost. Policy and risk appetite limits require us and the Bank (and other entities within our business, as applicable) to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time period. Our risk appetite policies also call for funding diversification, monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets, and limits on the amounts of certificates of deposit maturities in any one month. Our ALCO reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the ERMC and our board of directors.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (i.e. natural disasters) or compliance, reputational or legal matters, and includes any of those risks as they relate directly to us and our subsidiaries, including the Bank, as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business. Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational risk also includes model risk relating to various financial and other models used by us and our subsidiaries, including the Bank, and is subject to a formal governance process.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk consists of the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the business environment and from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business environment. Our operational risk team will conduct a formal strategic risk assessment at least annually, and establish risk mitigation plans for top strategic risks. The Bank’s New Product Innovation Council assesses the strategic viability and consistency of each new Bank product or service. New initiatives require the approval of the MC and our board of directors, in the case of projects deemed more risky or critical to the mission of the business.

Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities

Responsibility for risk management flows to individuals and entities throughout our Company, including our board of directors, various board and management committees and senior management. We believe our credit risk culture has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, the evolution of an effective risk presence across the Company. Set forth below is a description of the roles and responsibilities related to the key elements of our risk management framework.

Board of Directors

Our board of directors, among other things, has approved the enterprise-wide risk appetite statement and framework for the Company, as well as certain other risk management policies and oversees the Company’s strategic plan and enterprise-wide risk management program. Our board of directors may assign certain risk management activities to applicable committees and management.










Board Committees

Our board of directors has established four committees that assist the board in its oversight of our risk management. These committees and their risk-related roles are described below.

Audit Committee

In coordination with the Risk Committees of the Company and the Bank, the Audit Committee’s role, among other things, is to review: (i) the Company’s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these risks; (ii) the Company’s risk assessment and risk management practices and the guidelines, policies and processes for risk assessment and risk management; (iii) the organization, performance and audit findings of our internal audit function; (iv) our disclosure and internal controls; and (v) the Company’s risk guidelines and policies relating to financial statements, financial systems, financial reporting processes, compliance and auditing, and allowance for loan losses.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review and approve certain transactions with related persons; (ii) review and resolve any conflict of interest involving directors or executive officers; (iii) oversee the risks, if any, related to corporate governance structure and practices; and (iv) identify and discuss with management the risks, if any, related to social responsibility actions and public policy initiatives.

Management Development and Compensation Committee

The Management Development and Compensation Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review our incentive compensation arrangements with a view to appropriately balancing risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose us or any of our subsidiaries to imprudent risks, and are consistent with safety and soundness; and (ii) review (with input from our CRO and the Bank’s CRO) the relationship between risk management policies and practices, corporate strategies and senior executive compensation.

Risk Committee










Management Committees

We have established two management committees with important roles and responsibilities in our risk management function: the ERMC (of which the ALCO is a subcommittee) and the MC. These committees and their risk-related roles are described below.

Management Committee

The MC is under the oversight of the board of directors and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by our Chief Executive Officer.  The MC has responsibility for reviewing and approving lending and investment activities of the Company, such as equity investments, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, portfolio deals and investment issues regarding the Company.  It is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s approach to managing its investments, reviewing and approving the Company’s annual strategic plan and annual operating plan, and overseeing activities administered by its Loan, Credit Strategy, Customer Experience, Information Technology, New Product & Innovation and Pricing subcommittees.  The MC also reviews management reports provided on a periodic basis, or as requested, in order to monitor evolving issues, effectiveness of risk mitigation activities and performance against strategic plans.  The MC may make decisions only within the authority that is granted to it by the board of directors and must escalate any investment or other proposals outside of its authority to the board of directors for final decision.

ERMC

A management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee, the ERMC is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the CRO. The ERMC has responsibility for identifying, assessing, monitoring and mitigating risks across the Company and for reporting on material risks to our Risk Committee. The responsibilities of the ERMC include the day-to-day management of risks impacting the Company and ensuring compliance across the Company with the overall risk appetite. The ERMC also oversees establishment of risk management policies, the performance and functioning of the relevant overall risk management function, and the implementation of appropriate governance activities and systems that support control of risks.

ALCO

A subcommittee of the ERMC, the ALCO is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the Treasurer. It identifies, measures, monitors, manages and controls market, liquidity and credit (investments and bank relationships) risks to the Company’s balance sheet. ALCO activities include reviewing and monitoring cash management, investments, liquidity, funding and foreign exchange risk activities and overseeing the safe, sound and efficient operation of the Company in compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations.

Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Other Senior Officers

Our Chief Executive Officer has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the management of the Company’s risk in accordance with the Company’s approved risk appetite statement, including through her role as chairperson of the MC. The Chief Executive Officer also provides leadership in communicating the risk appetite to internal and external stakeholders so as to help embed appropriate risk taking into the overall risk culture.

The CRO manages our risk management team and, as chairperson of the ERMC, is responsible for establishing and implementing standards for the identification, management and measurement of risk on an enterprise-wide basis, as well as for monitoring and reporting such risks. In collaboration with our Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, the CRO has responsibility for developing an appropriate risk appetite with corresponding limits that aligns with supervisory expectations and this risk appetite statement has been approved by our board of directors. The CRO regularly reports to our board of directors and the Risk Committee on risk management matters.

Our senior executive officers are responsible for ensuring that their respective functions operate within established risk limits, in accordance with the Company’s enterprise risk management policy. As members of the ERMC and the MC, they are also responsible for identifying risks, considering risk when developing strategic plans, budgets and new products and implementing appropriate risk controls when pursuing business strategies and objectives. In addition, senior executive officers are responsible for deploying sufficient financial resources and qualified personnel to manage the risks inherent in the Company’s business activities.










Risk Management Team

Our risk management team is led by the CRO and provides oversight of our risk profile and the risk profiles of our subsidiaries. This provides a “second line of defense” to the functional organizations’ primary role in creating an appropriate control environment for each functional process.

Compliance Team

Our compliance team is responsible for establishing and maintaining a compliance program that includes compliance risk identification, assessment, policy development, and monitoring, testing, training and reporting activities.

Internal Audit Team

The internal audit team is responsible for performing periodic, independent reviews and testing of compliance with the Company’s and the Bank’s risk management policies and standards, as well as with regulatory guidance and industry best practices. The internal audit team also assesses the design and operating effectiveness of these policies and standards and validates risk management controls.

Enterprise Risk Assessment Program

Enterprise risk assessments play an important role in directing our risk management activities to prioritize and focus on appropriate risks. We will conduct assessments at least annually for each risk category and update those assessments periodically. The risk leader for each risk category will direct the assessment process, reviewing not only the current type and level of risks, but also compliance with regulatory guidance and industry best practices as well as policy and procedural compliance. Progress against any action plans that have been put into place to manage key risks will be tracked and reported to the ERMC.

Stress testing efforts as part of the risk assessment process continue to evolve as we model scenarios exploring multi-risk impacts on profitability, liquidity and capital levels. Stress testing activities provide a forward-looking assessment of risks and losses. We seek to integrate the results of our stress testing into our strategic, capital and liquidity planning processes, and will use the results to identify portfolio vulnerabilities and develop risk mitigation strategies or contingency plans across a range of stressed conditions.

Risk Appetite Framework

We operate in accordance with a risk appetite statement setting forth our objectives, plans and limits, and expressing our preferences with respect to risk-taking activities in the context of our overall business goals. The risk appetite statement was approved in connection with the IPO by the ERMC, the Risk Committee and our board of directors, with delegated authority to the CRO for implementation throughout the Company. The risk appetite statement serves as a tool to preclude activities that are inconsistent with our business and risk strategy. The risk appetite statement will be reviewed and approved at least annually as part of our business planning process and will be modified, as necessary, to include updated risk tolerances by risk category, enabling us to meet prescribed goals while continuing to operate within our established risk boundaries.

Regulation

____________________________________________________________________________________________

General

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel.










As a savings and loan holding company, Synchrony is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Prior to July 21, 2011, savings and loan holding companies, such as the Bank’s parent before Synchrony, were subject to regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision (“OTS”). As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB. Until the GE SLHC Deregistration, we will be controlled by GECC, which is also a savings and loan holding company and is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, the Financial Stability Oversight Council has designated GECC as a nonbank systemically important financial institution (a “nonbank SIFI”) under the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States. As discussed further throughout this section, certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking that will take effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us or across the industry. See also “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”

Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation

Overview

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to register and file periodic reports with, and are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as liquidity risk management, securitizations, operational risk management, internal controls and audit systems, business continuity, and compensation and other employee benefits. We are regularly reviewed and examined by the Federal Reserve Board, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require our response and attention. Our parent, GECC, as a savings and loan holding company, is also regularly reviewed and examined by the Federal Reserve Board, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of GECC’s business generally and our business specifically, that require response and attention.

The Federal Reserve Board has broad enforcement authority over us and our subsidiaries (other than the Bank and its subsidiaries). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control, such as the Bank. In addition, until the GE SLHC Deregistration, we will be controlled by GECC, which has its own regulatory obligations as a savings and loan holding company and as a nonbank SIFI. We may be affected by those obligations of GECC. See “—GECC’s Regulatory Status” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—As long as we are controlled by GECC for bank regulatory purposes, regulation and supervision of GECC could adversely affect us.”










Capital

As a savings and loan holding company, Synchrony historically has not been required to maintain any specific amount of minimum capital. Beginning as soon as 2015, however, we expect that Synchrony will be subject to capital requirements similar to those applicable to the Bank. In addition, until the GE SLHC Deregistration, we will be controlled by GECC, which itself is expected to be subject to capital requirements similar to those which apply to the Bank as well as any enhanced capital standards that may be imposed on it as a nonbank SIFI. The capital requirements applicable to the Bank have recently been substantially revised, including as a result of Basel III and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Although we cannot predict the effects of the newly adopted rules implementing Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act, Synchrony and GECC expect to be subject to increasingly stringent capital adequacy standards in the future. See “—GECC’s Regulatory Status” and “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—As long as we are controlled by GECC for bank regulatory purposes, regulation and supervision of GECC could adversely affect us.”

The following are the minimum capital ratios to which we and GECC expect to be subject starting as soon as during 2015:

•under the Basel III standardized approach, a Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a fully phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a fully phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a fully phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%);

•stress-tested minimum capital ratios described above of 5% Tier 1 common capital to risk-weighted assets, 6% Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets and 8% total capital to risk-weighted assets;

•a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total exposures of 4%; and

•in the case of GECC, a stress-tested minimum supplemental leverage ratio of 3%.

For a discussion of our capital ratios, see “Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital.”

In connection with applicable capital adequacy standards, we and GECC will also be required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s stress test regulations, we and GECC will each be required to utilize stress-testing methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions. In addition, as part of meeting our minimum capital requirements, we and GECC may be required to comply with the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) process, or some modified version of the CCAR process, which would measure our minimum capital requirement levels under various stress scenarios. In connection with such a process, we and GECC may be required to develop for the Federal Reserve Board’s review and approval a capital plan that will include how we and GECC will meet our minimum capital requirements under specified stress scenarios.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

We are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the Federal Reserve Board, including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. If we intend to declare or pay a dividend, we generally will be required to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board in advance to ensure that such dividend does not raise supervisory concerns. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a savings and loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition.

According to guidance from the Federal Reserve Board, our dividend policies will be assessed against, among other things, our ability to achieve applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements. If we do not achieve applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements when they are fully phased-in, we may not be able to pay dividends. Although we currently expect to meet the applicable final Basel III capital ratio requirements, inclusive of any applicable capital conservation buffer, when they are fully phased in by the Federal Reserve Board, we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or even if we do, if we will be able to pay dividends.










We also will be required to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board in advance of redeeming or repurchasing our stock if the result will be a net reduction in our equity compared to our equity as of the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurs. In evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock, the Federal Reserve Board will consider, among other things, the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration, and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased. The Federal Reserve Board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lower-tier form of regulatory capital issued. Moreover, the approval process for any capital plan we are required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions.

Until the GE SLHC Deregistration, we will be controlled by GECC, which as a savings and loan holding company is subject to all of the same regulatory requirements regarding dividends and stock repurchases and redemptions to which we are subject. Accordingly, until the GE SLHC Deregistration, our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares may be affected by GECC’s ability to meet the same requirements to which we are subject. In addition, as a nonbank SIFI, GECC may be required to provide a capital plan for Federal Reserve Board approval that includes proposed capital distributions (including dividends and stock redemptions or repurchases) not only by GECC but also by entities controlled by GECC, such as us. As long as we are controlled by GECC for bank regulatory purposes, any such capital plan requirement imposed on GECC by the Federal Reserve Board could affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our shares or redeem the notes prior to maturity.

Activities

In general, savings and loan holding companies may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in, financial activities specified in the relevant provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act and Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. We and each of our current parent companies are not subject to these activity restrictions and therefore are permitted to engage in non-financial activities, because we are grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies. This grandfathered status is based on the fact that our parent companies, GE and GECC, became grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies through the conversion of GE Capital Retail Bank from a state bank to a federal savings bank under an application pending with the OTS before May 4, 1999. We succeeded to our parent companies’ grandfathered status upon becoming a savings and loan holding company on April 1, 2013.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that until the earlier to occur of: (i) the time immediately prior to the Split-off and (ii) the GE SLHC Deregistration, no stockholder or group (other than GE or its affiliates and certain other exempt persons) shall have the right to vote more than 4.99% of our capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors. We are not aware of any stockholder or group (other than GE or its affiliates) that has acquired, or otherwise owns or controls more than 4.99% of our capital stock, including through the IPO. Assuming the GE SLHC Deregistration occurs, and possibly at the Separation if it occurs prior to the GE SLHC Deregistration, we expect we will then no longer qualify to be a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company. See “

Item 1A.



Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Separation from GE—We need Federal Reserve Board approval to continue to be a savings and loan holding company following the GE SLHC Deregistration. We may not receive this approval in a timely manner or at all, and additional approval conditions beyond what we are anticipating may be imposed that prevent or delay the Separation or the GE SLHC Deregistration or require us to incur significant additional expense

.” If we were no longer to qualify to be a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company, we would be subject to the activity restrictions. In that event, although we are not currently engaged in non-financial activities, we will also need to submit to the Federal Reserve Board a request to become a financial holding company in order to engage in activities that are permissible only for savings and loan holding companies that are treated as financial holding companies (including to continue to obtain financing through our securitization programs).










Certain acquisitions of our voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act and the Savings and Loan Holding Company Act, which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without, in most cases, the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

Savings Association Regulation

Overview

The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC and the FDIC. The OCC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. The Bank is periodically reviewed and examined by the OCC and the FDIC, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of the Bank’s business that require the Bank’s response and attention. In addition, the OCC and the FDIC have broad enforcement authority over the Bank.

Capital

The Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital. The OCC may impose capital requirements on individual institutions in excess of these requirements on a case-by-case basis. Institutions that are not well-capitalized are subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. The OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against an institution that fails to meet the minimum ratios for an adequately capitalized institution. At December 31, 2014, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized under OCC regulations.

The capital requirements to which the Bank is subject have recently been substantially revised, including as a result of Basel III and the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The following are the minimum capital ratios to which the Bank expects to be subject starting as early as 2015:

•under the Basel III standardized approach, a Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a fully phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a fully phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a fully phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%); and

•a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total exposures of 5%.










For a discussion of the Bank’s capital ratios, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital.”

The Bank is also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the OCC’s stress test regulations, the Bank is required to utilize stress-testing methodologies providing for results under at least three different sets of conditions, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse conditions.

As an insured depository institution, the Bank is also subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), which requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. At December 31, 2014, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA. As described above, recently-issued rules of the federal banking agencies regarding the implementation of Basel III and the Dodd-Frank Act will alter the capital adequacy framework applicable to the Bank starting in 2015. In addition, the Bank is subject to enhanced capital and liquidity requirements under the operating agreement with the OCC described below under “—Activities.”

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

OCC regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital, including payment of dividends, stock redemptions and repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. The Bank must obtain the OCC’s approval or give the OCC prior notice before making a capital distribution in certain circumstances, including if the Bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements (or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution) or certain net income requirements. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board or the OCC may object to a capital distribution if: among other things, (i) the Bank is, or as a result of such distribution would be, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, (ii) the regulators have safety and soundness concerns or (iii) the distribution violates a prohibition in a statute, regulation, agreement between us and the OCC, or a condition imposed on us in an application or notice approved by the OCC. Additional restrictions on dividends apply if the Bank fails the QTL test (described below under “—Activities”).

The FDIA also prohibits any depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” If a depository institution is less than adequately capitalized, it must prepare and submit a capital restoration plan to its primary federal regulator for approval. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, among other things, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” A “significantly undercapitalized” depository institution may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” elect a new board of directors, reduce total assets or cease taking deposits from correspondent banks. A “critically undercapitalized” institution may be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver which could sell or liquidate the institution.

Activities

Under the Home Owners’ Loan Act (“HOLA”), the OCC requires the Bank to comply with the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL” test. Under the QTL test, the Bank is required to maintain at least 65.00% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20.00% of total assets, (ii) intangibles, including goodwill and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans, student loans and small business loans) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. The Bank currently meets that test. A savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter. Also, if the Bank fails to meet the QTL test, Synchrony, as well as GE, GECC and GECFI, would no longer qualify to be grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding companies.










Savings associations, including the Bank, are subject as well to limitations on their lending and investments. These limitations include percentage of asset limitations on various types of loans the Bank may make. In addition, there are similar limitations on the types and amounts of investments the Bank may make.

Insured depository institutions, including the Bank, are subject to restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (as implemented by Federal Reserve Board Regulation W), which govern transactions between an insured depository institution and any affiliate, including an entity that is the institution’s direct or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company. Restrictions in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act apply to “covered transactions” such as extensions of credit, issuances of guarantees or asset purchases. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is limited, as to any one affiliate of the Bank, to 10% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus, and, as to all of the Bank’s affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus. In addition, transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered by the Bank to non-affiliated companies (i.e., at arm’s length).

The CRA is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments, offer products and provide services, in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of CRA activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities. These records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution. Based on these examinations, the agency rates the institution’s compliance with CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The CRA requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA rating of “Outstanding” as of its most recent CRA examination.

The FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited) unless it is “well-capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions under the FDIA on a bank that is “well-capitalized.” Further, “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations. At December 31, 2014, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA. An inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity.

In connection with the OCC’s December 12, 2012 approval of the Bank’s assumption of certain deposits and related liabilities of MetLife and acquisition of certain assets of MetLife, the Bank entered into an Operating Agreement with the OCC (the “Operating Agreement”) and also into a Capital Assurance and Liquidity Maintenance Agreement with GECC, GECFI and Synchrony (the “CALMA”) on January 11, 2013. The material terms of the Operating Agreement and the CALMA are summarized below, and the Operating Agreement and the CALMA have been filed as exhibits to this report.

The Operating Agreement requires, among other things, that the Bank: (i) maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 11%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 7% and a leverage ratio of at least 6%, (ii) maintain liquid assets at least equal to the greater of $500 million or 90 days’ coverage of the Bank’s operating expenses, (iii) not materially change or significantly deviate from a business plan for 2013 and 2014 that was submitted to the OCC without first giving the OCC notice and obtaining its supervisory non-objection, (iv) must meet certain conditions to declare or pay a dividend (including being in compliance with the Operating Agreement), (v) maintain a board with at least 40% independent directors and (vi) for three years immediately after the date of the Operating Agreement, not appoint any new director or senior executive officer or enter into a material services contract with an affiliate without providing prior notice to the OCC.










The CALMA requires, among other things, that GECC, GECFI and Synchrony shall: (i) make capital infusions as requested by the Bank to ensure that the Bank remains in compliance with the capital requirements of the Operating Agreement, (ii) provide such financial support as requested by the Bank to ensure that the Bank remains in compliance with the liquidity requirements of the Operating Agreement, and (iii) provide certain information to the Bank and the OCC relevant to their financial condition and ability to fulfill their obligations under the CALMA. We currently expect that the CALMA’s obligations will terminate as to GECC and GECFI once GE no longer controls the Bank as defined in the CALMA or as otherwise determined by the OCC. We expect that Synchrony will continue to be subject to the CALMA’s obligations after the Bank and Synchrony are no longer controlled by GE.

Deposit Insurance

The FDIA requires the Bank to pay deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”). The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the DIF to 1.35% and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio. The FDIC subsequently set a reserve ratio of 2% and may increase that ratio in the future. Under the FDIC’s current deposit insurance assessment methodology, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average consolidated total assets, less average tangible equity, and various other regulatory factors included in an FDIC assessment scorecard.

The FDIA creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions, including the Bank. If any such institution is placed into receivership, the FDIC will pay (out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets) first secured creditors (to the extent of their security), second the administrative expenses of the receivership, third all deposits liabilities (both insured and uninsured), fourth any other general or senior liabilities, fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors, and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity.

The Bank may be held liable by the FDIC for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred by the DIF, due to the default of another commonly controlled FDIC-insured institution or for any assistance provided by the FDIC to another commonly controlled FDIC-insured institution that is in danger of default. As long as we are directly or indirectly controlled by GE, the Bank will be commonly controlled with another FDIC-insured institution, GE Capital Bank, an industrial bank chartered under the laws of Utah.










Consumer Financial Services Regulation

Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal banking regulators, as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies, also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including civil money penalties and fines.

The CARD Act was enacted in 2009 and most of the requirements became effective in 2010. The CARD Act made numerous amendments to the Truth in Lending Act, requiring us to make significant changes to many of our business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. The CARD Act’s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers. Other CARD Act restrictions, such as limitations on late fees, have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income.

The FCRA regulates the Bank’s and our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies, and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers. The FCRA also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes, requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when risk-based pricing is used in a credit decision, and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft.

Under HOLA, the Bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the Bank or Synchrony or their subsidiaries or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. Certain arrangements are permissible. For example, the Bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products.










The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as us. In addition, the CFPB has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the products we offer. The system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory, enforcement or examination focus. There continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities will have an impact on our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Although we have been subject to various matters with the CFPB as described below, neither the Company nor the Bank has had its first comprehensive examination by the CFPB, and we cannot predict when such examination will occur or what the results will be. See “

Item 1A.



Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is a new agency and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions will impact our business; the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business.

”

In July 2012, the CFPB issued an industry bulletin regarding marketing practices with respect to credit card add-on products, including debt cancellation products. The Bank has made a number of changes, including changes in response to the CFPB bulletin, with respect to its marketing and sale of debt cancellation products to credit card customers, including ceasing all telesales of such products, and the Bank has also enhanced the disclosures associated with its website sales of such products. See “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Litigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.”

In October 2013 the CFPB published its first biennial report reviewing the impact of the CARD Act on the consumer credit card market. In the report, the CFPB identified practices that may warrant further scrutiny by it, including add-on products (such as debt protection, identity theft protection, credit score monitoring, and other products that are supplementary to the extension of credit), cards that charge substantial application fees, and deferred interest offers and products (which could include our promotional financing products). The report further identified concerns regarding the adequacy of online disclosures as well as of the disclosures associated with rewards products and grace periods. Separately, the CFPB is also studying pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and our litigation exposure could increase if the CFPB exercises its authority to limit or ban pre-dispute arbitration clauses.










Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Relation to Regulation—Changes to our methods of offering our CareCredit products could materially impact operating results

.”

On June 19, 2014, we entered into a consent order with the CFPB (the “2014 CFPB Consent Order”) that requires us to refund $56 million to cardholders who enrolled in a debt cancellation product over the telephone from January 2010 to October 2012 ($11 million of which was refunded prior to the 2014 CFPB Consent Order), pay civil money penalties of $3.5 million, and implement a compliance plan related to the sale of “add-on” products to the extent the Bank restarts telesales of such products (which were discontinued in October 2012).










GECC’s Regulatory Status

GECC is a regulated savings and loan holding company and therefore is subject to all of the regulatory obligations to which we are subject. Until the GE SLHC Deregistration, GECC’s regulatory obligations as a savings and loan holding company may, for reasons related or unrelated to us, materially and adversely affect us, including restricting our ability to initiate, pay dividends or repurchase stock or continue various business activities or practices.

As a nonbank SIFI, GECC is subject to enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board. Nonbank SIFIs, such as GECC, currently are subject to some, but not all, of the enhanced prudential standards under the Dodd-Frank Act, such as resolution planning. The Federal Reserve Board has also proposed to apply other enhanced prudential standards to GECC by order. If adopted as proposed, these standards are expected to include, among other things, enhanced board and risk governance, enhanced capital and liquidity levels, compliance with capital planning and stress-testing requirements and market terms requirements for intercompany transactions. Although the enhanced prudential standards currently applicable to GECC in its capacity as a nonbank SIFI do not have the effect of imposing direct regulatory obligations on us, we cannot be certain that standards imposed in the future by the Federal Reserve Board on GECC as a nonbank SIFI will not have the effect of directly or indirectly imposing obligations or restrictions on us so long as we are controlled by GECC for bank regulatory purposes. See “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—As long as we are controlled by GECC for bank regulatory purposes, regulation and supervision of GECC could adversely affect us.”

GE Transfer of Unrelated Bank

As part of the Separation (assuming it is accomplished by the Split-off), GE intends to transfer ownership of GE Capital Bank (a bank that is and will be separate from and unrelated to Synchrony and the Bank) from one of its subsidiaries to another. GE has indicated to us that it does not believe that this transfer requires an application to, or an approval or non-objection by, any bank regulatory authorities. However, if those authorities disagree and were to require an application or other opportunity for approval or non-objection, we cannot predict what action the authorities might take on such an application or notice, or what conditions or restrictions, if any, the regulators might impose in connection with any such action. Any such action, or any conditions or restrictions in connection with such action, could have a material adverse effect on GE’s ability to retain that bank and could affect GE’s willingness to proceed with the Separation as currently planned.










Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Program

We maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act and the U.S. Patriot Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. The program is coordinated by a compliance officer, undergoes an annual independent audit to assess its effectiveness, and requires training of employees. See “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Failure to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us.”

Sanctions Programs

We have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered and enforced by OFAC. These sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals. We maintain policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs.

Section 13(r) Disclosure

GE, our parent company, included the following disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act within its Form 10-Q for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014:

“GE Money Bank, Czech Republic (GEMB CZ) is a full-service retail bank in the Czech Republic and a subsidiary of General Electric Capital Corporation. GEMB CZ maintains a $7.5 million line of credit and three cash accounts for DF DeutscheForfait s.r.o., a Czech company (DF Sub), which purchases receivables from imports and exports in Central and Eastern Europe. DF Sub is a subsidiary of DF Deutsche Forfait AG, a German company (DF Parent). On February 6, 2014, DF Parent was added to the specially designated nationals and blocked persons (SDN List) of the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) pursuant to E.O. 13382. The accounts at GEMB CZ for DF Sub pre-date this designation. Following the designation, GEMB CZ terminated its relationship with DF Sub. We believe that the transactions with DF Sub were permissible and do not violate U.S. law.”

GE Money Bank, Czech Republic is not a subsidiary of, or operated by, the Company.
