OUR BUSINESS

Our Company

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We are a premier consumer financial services company. We deliver a wide range of specialized financing programs, as well as innovative consumer banking products, across key industries including digital, retail, home, auto, travel, health and pet. We provide a range of credit products through our financing programs which we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our “partners.” Through our partners’ over

410,000

locations across the United States and Canada, and their websites and mobile applications, we offer their customers a variety of credit products to finance the purchase of goods and services. During


, we financed

$149.4 billion

of purchase volume, and at

December 31, 2019

, we had

$87.2 billion

of loan receivables and

75.5 million

active accounts. Our active accounts represent a geographically diverse group of both consumers and businesses, with an average FICO score of


for active accounts at

December 31, 2019

.

Our business benefits from longstanding and collaborative relationships with our partners, including some of the nation’s leading retailers and manufacturers with well-known consumer brands, such as Lowe’s and Ashley HomeStore and also leading digital partners, such as Amazon and PayPal. We believe our partner-centric business model has been successful because it aligns our interests with those of our partners and provides substantial value to both our partners and our customers. Our partners promote our credit products because they generate increased sales and strengthen customer loyalty. Our customers benefit from instant access to credit, discounts, such as cash back rewards, and promotional offers. We seek to differentiate ourselves through deep partner integration and our extensive marketing expertise. We have omni-channel (in-store, online and mobile) technology and marketing capabilities, which allow us to offer and deliver our credit products instantly to customers across multiple channels.

We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Profitability and expenses, including funding costs, loan losses and operating expenses, are managed for the business as a whole. Substantially all of our operations are within the United States. We offer our credit products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit). Those platforms are organized by the types of products we offer and the partners we work with, and are measured on interest and fees on loans, loan receivables, active accounts and other sales metrics. Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards, and small and medium-sized business credit products. Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health, veterinary and personal care procedures, services and products, including dental, vision, audiology and cosmetic.

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. In addition, through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”), money market accounts and savings accounts. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$65.1 billion

in deposits, which represented

77%

of our total funding sources.


Our Sales Platforms

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We offer our credit products through three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Set forth below is a summary of certain information relating to our Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit platforms:

Retail Card

Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards and small and medium-sized business credit products. Retail Card accounted for

$13.6 billion

, or

73%

, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard (i.e., non-promotional) terms.

Retail Card’s revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables. Other income primarily consists of interchange fees earned when our Dual Card or general purpose co-brand cards are used outside of our partners’ sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments.

Retail Card Partners

We have Retail Card programs with


national and regional retailers, which have approximately

10,000

retail locations and include department stores, specialty retailers, mass merchandisers and digital (multi-channel and online retailers). The average length of our relationship with our Retail Card partners is


years. Our oil and gas retail credit programs are no longer reported within our Retail Card sales platform and are now reported within our Payment Solutions sales platform.


Our five largest ongoing programs are with Retail Card partners. Based upon interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, excluding the Walmart program, our five largest programs were: Gap, JCPenney, Lowe’s, PayPal and Sam’s Club. These programs accounted in aggregate for

47%

of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, and

48%

of loan receivables at

December 31, 2019

. Our programs with Lowe's and PayPal each accounted for more than 10% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. In October 2019, we sold $8.2 billion of receivables associated with our consumer program agreement with Walmart.

The length of our relationship with each of our five largest ongoing Retail Card partners is over


years, and in the case of Lowe's, 40 years. The current expiration dates for these agreements range from 2022 through 2030. Within the last eighteen months, we have extended our program agreements with the majority of these key partners, including most recently our agreement announced in October 2019 to extend our program agreement with PayPal, and also to become the exclusive issuer of a Venmo co-branded consumer credit card.

New and Extended Partner Programs

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, in addition to our agreement with PayPal discussed above, we announced our new partnerships with Norwegian Air, and in January 2020, with Verizon, and also extended our program agreement with Dick's Sporting Goods.

A total of


of our


ongoing Retail Card program agreements, now have an expiration date in 2022 or beyond. These


program agreements represented in the aggregate

98%

of both our Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

and of our Retail Card loan receivables at

December 31, 2019

attributable to our ongoing programs.

Retail Card Program Agreements

Our Retail Card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners. Although the terms of the agreements are partner-specific, and may be amended from time to time, under a typical program agreement, our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers, but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Other key provisions in the Retail Card program agreements include:


Term

Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years. Many program agreements have renewal clauses that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner. We typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates.

Exclusivity

The program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or co-branded credit cards during the term of the agreement.

Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our Retail Card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually-defined threshold. Economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses). We may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products.

Other Economic Terms

In addition to the retailer share arrangements, the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program, and they set the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded, the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product (such as opportunities to receive double rewards points for purchases made on a Retail Card product), and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program.

Termination

The program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration. Our program agreements generally permit us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its obligations. Some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers, we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, we are not adequately capitalized, certain force majeure events occur or certain changes in our ownership occur. Certain program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its financial condition. Historically, these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised. Some of our program agreements provide that, upon termination or expiration, our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with respect to its program at fair market value or a stated price, including all related customer data.

Payment Solutions

Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering consumer choice for financing at the point of sale, including primarily private label credit cards, Dual Cards and installment loans. Payment Solutions accounted for

$2.8 billion

, or

15%

, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. Credit extended in this platform, other than for our oil and gas retail partners, is primarily promotional financing.


Payment Solutions’ revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including “merchant discounts,” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. The types of promotional financing we offer include deferred interest (interest accrues during a promotional period and becomes payable if the full purchase amount is not paid off during the promotional period), no interest (no interest on a promotional purchase) and reduced interest (interest is assessed monthly at a promotional interest rate during the promotional period). As a result, during the promotional period we do not generate interest income or generate it at a lower rate, although we continue to generate fee income relating to late fees on required minimum payments.

Payment Solutions Partners

In Payment Solutions, we create customized credit programs for national and regional retailers, manufacturers, buying groups, and industry associations. In addition, we create our own industry vertical programs, which are available to local, small and medium size merchants to provide financing offers to their customers.

At

December 31, 2019

, our Payment Solutions partners had approximately

160,000

retail locations, including oil and gas retail locations. Payment Solutions is diversified by program, with no one Payment Solutions program accounting for more than 1.3% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. At

December 31, 2019

, the average length of our relationships with our ten largest ongoing Payment Solutions programs was 13 years.

_____________________

(1)

Ongoing partners. Based on interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2019.

In Payment Solutions, we generally partner with sellers of “big-ticket” products or services (generally priced from $500 to $25,000) to consumers where our financing products and industry expertise provide strong incremental value to our partners and their customers. We also promote our programs to sellers through direct marketing activities such as industry trade publications, trade shows and sales efforts by dedicated internal and external sales teams, leveraging our existing partner network or through endorsements from manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Our broad array of point of sale technologies and quick enrollment process allow us to quickly and cost-effectively integrate new partners.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we expanded our Synchrony Car Care and Synchrony HOME program acceptance networks and announced our new partnerships with Grand Home Furnishings, Leisure Pro, Mor furniture for less, Samsung HVAC, Travis Industries, and Zero Motorcycles. We also extended our program agreements with BuyMax Alliance, CCA Global Partners, CFMOTO, Conn's HomePlus, Continental Tires, La-Z-Boy, P.C. Richard & Son, Penske, Polaris, Rheem, Rooms To Go, and Suzuki. In January 2020, we completed the sale of loan receivables associated with the Yamaha portfolio.


Payment Solutions Program Agreements

National and Regional Retailers and Manufacturers

The terms of our program agreements with national and regional retailers and manufacturers are typically similar to the terms of our Retail Card program agreements in that we are the exclusive program provider of financing for the national or regional retailer or manufacturer with respect to the financing products that we offer. Some program agreements, however, allow the merchant to use a second source lender after an application has been submitted to us and declined, or in the case of some of our programs, may allow the manufacturer to have several primary lenders. The terms of the program agreements generally run from three to five years and are subject to termination prior to the scheduled termination date by us or our partner for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its obligations. Some of these programs also permit our partner to terminate the program if we change certain key cardholder terms, exceed certain pricing thresholds, certain force majeure events occur, certain changes in our ownership occur or there is a material adverse change in our financial condition. A few of these programs also may be terminated at will by the partner on specified notice to us (e.g., several months). Many of these program agreements have renewal clauses which allow the program agreement to be renewed for successive one or more year terms until terminated by us or our partner. We typically negotiate with program participants to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates.

We control credit criteria and issue credit cards or provide installment loans to customers who qualify under those credit criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Our Payment Solutions program agreements set forth the program’s economic terms, including the merchant discount applicable to each promotional finance offering. We typically do not pay fees to our Payment Solutions partners pursuant to any retailer share arrangements, but in some cases we pay a sign-up fee to a partner or provide volume-based rebates on the merchant discount paid by the partner.

Buying Groups and Industry Associations

The programs we have established with buying groups and industry associations, such as the Home Furnishings Association, Jewelers of America and Nationwide Marketing Group, are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers, but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers. Under the terms of the program agreements, buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs. These arrangements may include sign-up fees and volume-based incentives paid by us to the groups and their members.

Synchrony-Branded Networks

Our Synchrony-branded networks are focused on specific industries, where we create either company-branded or company and partner-branded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industry-specific network. For example, our Synchrony Car Care network, comprised of merchants selling automotive parts, repair services and tires, covers over

730,000

locations across the United States, and cards issued may be dual branded with Synchrony Car Care and partners such as Midas, Michelin Tires or Pep Boys. Under the terms of these networks, we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer, and, in some cases, the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network. In addition, we also earn interchange fees through credit card transactions outside of the program network. The Synchrony Car Care network allows for expanded use outside of the program network at certain related merchants, such as gas stations. Similarly, the Synchrony HOME credit card is accepted at more than one million home-related retail locations nationwide, including both partner locations and retailers outside of our program network.


Dealer Agreements

For the programs we have established with manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations, industry vertical programs and Synchrony-branded networks described above, we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs. These agreements generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors. Our agreements generally continue until terminated by either party, with termination typically available to either party at will upon 15 days’ written notice. Our dealer agreements set forth the economic terms associated with the program, including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing, and in some cases, allow us to periodically change the fees we charge.

CareCredit

CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health, veterinary and personal care procedures, services and products. CareCredit accounted for

$2.3 billion

, or

12%

, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. Substantially all of the credit extended in CareCredit is promotional financing.

We offer customers a CareCredit-branded private label credit card that may be used across our network of CareCredit providers and our CareCredit Dual Card offering. We generate revenue in CareCredit primarily from interest and fees on our loan receivables and from merchant discounts paid by providers to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.

In March 2019, we announced our acquisition of Pets Best and entry into the pet health insurance industry as a managing general agent. This acquisition allows CareCredit to offer comprehensive financial options to consumers for veterinary care.

CareCredit Partners

The vast majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers, which includes networks of healthcare practitioners that provide elective and other procedures that generally are not fully covered by insurance. The remainder are primarily national and regional healthcare providers and health-focused retailers, such as pharmacies. At

December 31, 2019

, we had a network of CareCredit providers and health-focused retailers that collectively have over

240,000

locations.

During


, over

200,000

locations either processed a CareCredit application or made a sale on a CareCredit credit card. No one CareCredit partner accounted for more than

0.2%

of our total interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.


We enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our CareCredit network. These provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our Payment Solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will upon 15 days’ notice. Multi-year agreements are in place for larger multi-location relationships across all markets. There are typically no retailer share arrangements with partners in CareCredit.

At

December 31, 2019

, we had relationships with over


professional and other associations (including the American Dental Association and the American Veterinary Medical Association), manufacturers and buying groups, which endorse and promote our credit products to their members. Of these relationships, over


were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in, and volume under, the relevant program.

We screen potential partners using a variety of criteria, including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties, carries the appropriate licensing and certifications, and meets our underwriting criteria. We also screen potential partners for reputational issues. We work with professional and other associations, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the products and services we offer. We believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate, which our research in


showed is

91%

. We also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail, advertising, and at trade shows.

During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we expanded our network through our new partnerships with Baylor Scott & White Medical Center, Kaiser Permanente, Lehigh Valley Physician's Group, Loyale, Simplee and St. Luke's University Health Network, renewed our agreements with Bosley and William Demant Holdings, and launched our new program with Lighthouse. The network also expanded by over

20,000

provider locations and grew average active cardholder accounts by

4%

.

Our Customers

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Acquiring and Marketing to Retail Card & Payment Solutions Customers

In our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms we work directly with our partners using their distribution network, communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their existing and potential customers. We believe our presence at partners’ points of sale (in-store, online and mobile) locations and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at a lower cost than issuers of general purpose cards.

To acquire new customers, we collaborate and deeply integrate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create programs that promote our products to creditworthy customers. Frequently, our partners market the availability of credit as part of the advertising for their goods and services. Our marketing programs include marketing offers (e.g., 10% off the customer’s first purchase) and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of channels, including in-store signage, online advertising, retailer website placement, associate communication, emails, text messages, direct mail campaigns, advertising circulars, and outside marketing via television, radio, print, and digital marketing (search engine optimization, paid search and personalization). We also employ our proprietary Quickscreen acquisition method to make targeted pre-approved credit offers at the point-of-sale. Our Quickscreen technology allows us to process customer information obtained from our partners through our risk models such that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners' points-of-sale, we can offer them credit instantly, if appropriate. Based on our experience, due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer, Quickscreen significantly outperforms traditional direct-to-consumer pre-approved channels, such as direct mail or email, in response rate and dollar spending.

In Payment Solutions we also market the value of cross-network benefits to our partners. For example, the Synchrony Car Care credit card offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations, as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide. In addition, we launched Synchrony HOME Network, which allows customers to finance items from home décor to mattresses to flooring at thousands of participating HOME locations nationwide.


Acquiring and Marketing to CareCredit Customers

We market our products through our network of providers by training them on the advantages of CareCredit and by creating marketing materials for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers. Our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pre-treatment consultation phase, including the option to apply for a CareCredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit. According to a


survey of our CareCredit customers,

50%

indicated they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider. Consumers can apply for our CareCredit products in the provider’s office or online via the web or mobile device.

As the market continues to evolve, we are increasingly seeing more customers from mobile and internet channels. Consumers are going online to look for information about the types of procedures or care they need, where to receive that care and how to pay for it. As such, we are promoting CareCredit directly to potential and existing customers using digital marketing. Our provider locator, on our website, allows customers to search among the more than 240,000 locations that accept the CareCredit credit card by desired geography and provider type. According to our records, our CareCredit provider locator averaged over

1.3 million

searches per month during the year ended

December 31, 2019

. We believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition and information about their practice.

We believe going direct to consumers through digital marketing will have several benefits. Customers will have a better understanding of the types of care they can pay for, the different financing options available and where they can use CareCredit. In addition, whether they choose to apply online or in the provider’s office, once approved, they can move forward with the care they want or need to feel better.

Enterprise Customer Engagement ("ECE") / Analytics

After a customer obtains one of our products, our marketing programs encourage ongoing card usage by communicating the benefits of our products’ value propositions. Examples of such programs include: promotional financing offers, cardholder events, product and partner discounts, dollar-off certificates, account holder sales, reward points and offers, new product announcements and previews, and other specific partner value offerings. These programs are executed through our partners’ and our own (direct to consumer) distribution channels.

Our ECE and data analytics teams, help us optimize these programs through detailed test-and-learn tracking of cardholder responsiveness and subsequent behavior. This data is leveraged by applying machine learning and other analytic techniques to create tools that allow for customized marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders. For example, if a cardholder consistently responds to a coupon sent by text message versus other channels, we will tailor future marketing messages to be delivered by text message and use such insight to identify other populations that are likely to behave in similar ways. Our Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card programs are further enhanced by the collection and analysis of data on customers' spend patterns at both our partners and at other retailers. The objective of these efforts is to drive incremental volume for our programs while maximizing return on investment.

Our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of re-use across both our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

,

30%

(excluding oil and gas retail partner programs) and

54%

of purchase volume across our Payment Solutions platform and CareCredit network, respectively, resulted from repeat use at one or more retailers or providers.

Digital and mobile capabilities

We remain focused on investing in our digital and mobile capabilities, bringing to market new features, channels and experiences for our customers and enhancing our existing digital design and user experience. Our approach continues to be customer and partner-centric to reach our customers in unique ways at home, in store, online or wherever they prefer. We believe these investments are critical to driving growth in our existing programs as well as securing renewals and winning new programs such as our new co-branded consumer credit cards for Venmo and Verizon.


In 2019, we continued to focus on our digital apply platform (“dApply”) and driving a simplified experience for our customers. We have launched capabilities that can securely pre-fill data from a variety of sources and bring the application process down to just 2 or 3 input fields while also improving the authentication of the customer. Combined with introducing more ways to start a new application, such as our new text-to-apply capability, and modernizing the user experience design of our terms display to be easier for our customers, the dApply platform continues to be critical in how we engage with our customers. In the fourth quarter of 2019, digital applications represented more than 50% of our total applications received.

We have also continued to introduce new ways for our customers to interact with their accounts. We’ve expanded our voice assistant offerings including, enabling our Store Card Skill on Amazon Alexa to now be available across all Alexa devices including those with screens. Our Amazon customers can now access and service their account using just their voice from their living room TV. We are also developing an account servicing capability on Google Home. With the continuing customer shift towards mobile, we’ve also introduced a mobile account lookup capability to give customers a secure, fast and easy way to access a digital representation of their card from their personal device that can be used at the retailer point of sale.

Digital account servicing now represents over

62%

of all account servicing done by our customers and we continue to invest in capabilities to improve this experience. We’ve introduced technology to allow our customers to securely link their Synchrony account servicing credentials to an online account they may have with a retailer, allowing for a seamless single-sign-on experience that more deeply merges the shopping and account management experiences. Finally, we are also developing the digital capabilities for our commercial account platforms, enabling many new features for digital servicing, and rolling out new modern digital apply platforms for in-store and online as well.

We are also investing in opening our platform to partners via application program interfaces (APIs) in the creation of our Synchrony Developer Portal. Through exposing an increasing array of APIs for the credit life-cycle, we are creating opportunities to build new and richer experiences with our partners and in 2019 we launched multiple new experiences with partners integrating our APIs into their digital assets focused on credit applications, rewards and account servicing. This will continue to be a significant strategic focus for Synchrony.

In our online direct banking operations we launched a native application on iOS and Android and a new website focused on enhancing the customer experience.

Finally, we’ve continued to expand the reach of our virtual assistant, Sydney, across our digital platforms and mobile servicing, and deepened her knowledge and ability to respond to the questions and tasks that our customers ask.

Loyalty Programs

The credit rewards loyalty programs we manage typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. The merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder, accessed digitally or may be immediately redeemable at the partner’s store. These loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty. We continue to support and integrate into our partners’ loyalty programs to customers that utilize non-credit payment types such as cash, debit or check. These multi-tender loyalty programs allow our partners to market to an expanded customer base and allow us access to additional prospective cardholders.

Commercial Customers

In addition to our efforts to acquire consumer cardholders, we continue to increase our focus on small to mid-sized commercial customers. We offer these customers private label credit cards and Dual Cards that can be used primarily at our Retail Card partners and are similar to our consumer offerings. We are also increasing our focus on marketing our commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product that supports a wide range of business customers.


Our Credit Products

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Through our platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also offer a debt cancellation product.

The following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer at

December 31, 2019

.

Credit Cards

Our credit card products are loans we extend through open-ended revolving credit card accounts. We offer the following principal types of credit cards:

Private Label Credit Cards

Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe’s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances.

Credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only in our Retail Card sales platform, which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed non-promotional fixed and/or variable interest rate, or pursuant to a promotional financing offer in our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms, involving deferred interest, no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period. Promotional periods typically range between six and 60 months, but we may agree to longer terms with the partner. In almost all cases, we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. The terms of these promotions vary by partner, but generally the longer the deferred interest, reduced interest or interest-free period, the greater the partner’s merchant discount. Some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate, rather than deferring or delaying interest charges. For our deferred interest products, approximately

80%

of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is assessed. In CareCredit, standard rate financing generally applies to charges under $200.

We typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services through our payment system.

Most of our private label credit card business is in the United States. For some of our partners who have locations in Canada, we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in Canada and from customers in Canada.


Dual Cards

and General Purpose Co-Brand Cards

Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to purchase goods and services from our partners, and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions. We currently issue Dual Cards for use on the MasterCard and Visa networks and we have the potential capability to issue Dual Cards for use on the American Express and Discover networks.

We have been granted two U.S. patents relating to the process by which our Dual Cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations.

We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards, as well as, in limited circumstances, a Synchrony-branded general purpose credit card.

Credit extended under our Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only. Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are offered across all of our sales platforms. At

December 31, 2019

, we offered either Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards through


ongoing partners and our CareCredit Dual Card, of which the majority are Dual Cards. We expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to these products.

Charges using a Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than in-store or online from that partner.

We currently do not issue Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards in Canada.

Terms and Conditions

As a general matter, the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time, although we seek to standardize the non-financial provisions consistently across all products. The terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

We assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened. Thereafter, we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time, at our discretion, based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay.

For the vast majority of accounts, periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method, which results in daily compounding of periodic interest charges, subject to, at times, a grace period on new purchases. Cash advances are not subject to a grace period, and some credit card programs do not provide a grace period for promotional purchases. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts, including, as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement, cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment due by the required due date.

Typically, each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month. A customer may pay the total amount due at any time without penalty. We also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules and to waive interest charges and/or fees.

Commercial Credit Products

We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. We offer our commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the commercial customers of our Retail Card partners.


Installment Loans

In Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power products market (motorcycles, ATVs and lawn and garden). Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. The terms of our installment loans are governed by customer agreements and applicable laws and regulations.

Installment loans are assessed periodic finance charges using fixed interest rates. In addition to periodic finance charges, we may impose other charges and fees on loan accounts, including late fees where a customer has not made the required payment by the required due date and returned payment fees.

Debt Cancellation Products

We offer a debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail. Customers who choose to purchase this product are charged a monthly fee based on their ending balance on each billing statement. In return, the Bank will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events.

Direct-to-Consumer Banking

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Through the Bank, we offer our customers a range of FDIC-insured deposit products. The Bank also takes brokered deposits through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$65.1 billion

in deposits,

$54.2 billion

of which were direct deposits and

$10.9 billion

of which were brokered deposits. At

December 31, 2019

, deposits represented

77%

of our total funding sources. During 2019, direct deposits were received from approximately

491,000

customers that had a total of approximately

1 million

accounts. Retail customers accounted for substantially all of our direct deposits at

December 31, 2019

. The Bank had a

85%

retention rate on certificates of deposit balances up for renewal for the year ended

December 31, 2019

. FDIC insurance is provided for our deposit products up to applicable limits.

We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. Our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network. During 2019 we launched a native application on iOS and Android and a new website focused on enhancing the customer experience. We expect the continued growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits from consumer customers.

We continue to grow our direct banking operations and believe we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to direct banking. According to the


American Bankers Association survey, approximately

77%

of customers primarily use direct channels (internet, mail, phone and mobile) to manage their bank accounts.

Our deposit products include certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. We market our deposit products through multiple channels including digital and print. Customers can apply for, fund, and service their deposit accounts online or via phone. We have dedicated banking representatives within our call centers to service deposit accounts. Fiserv, Inc. ("Fiserv") provides the core banking platform for our online retail deposits including a customer-facing account opening and servicing platform.

To attract new deposits and retain existing ones, we intend to introduce new deposit products, enhancements to our existing products, and deliver new capabilities. This may include the introduction of checking accounts, overdraft protection lines of credit, bill payment and person-to-person payment features, and Synchrony-branded debit cards. Our focus on deposit-taking and related branding efforts will also enable us to offer other branded direct-banking products more efficiently in the future.


We seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings from our competitors on the basis of brand, reputation, convenience, customer service and value. Our deposit products emphasize reliability, trust, security, convenience and attractive rates. We

offer rewards to customers based on their tenure or balance amounts, including reduced fees, travel offers and concierge telephone support.

Credit Risk Management

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us. Our credit risk arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across approximately

135 million

open accounts at

December 31, 2019

, without significant individual exposures. We manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types.

Customer Account Acquisition

We have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners. We originate credit accounts through several different channels, including in-store, mail, internet, mobile, telephone and pre-approved solicitations. In addition, we have, and may in the future, acquire accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners.

Regardless of the channel, in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit, we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures. In most cases, when applications are made in-store or by internet or mobile, the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately. We generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus. The credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score. The credit risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type. We periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage credit risk.

We also apply additional application screens based on various inputs, including credit bureau information, alternative data, our previous experience with the customer and information provided by our partner, to help identify additional factors, such as potential fraud and prior bankruptcies, before qualifying the application for approval. We compare applicants’ names against the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), as well as screens that account for adherence to USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) and Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “CARD Act”) requirements, including ability to pay requirements.

We also use pre-approved account solicitations for certain programs. Potential applicants are pre-screened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists, and qualified individuals receive a pre-approved credit offer by mail or email.

Acquired Portfolio Evaluation

Our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines. As part of this review, we receive data on the third-party accounts and loans, which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics, such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information. In addition, we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks. Finally, our risk management team must approve the acquisition, taking into account the results of our risk assessment process. Once assets are migrated to our systems, our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under “

—Customer Account Management

,” “

—Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions

” and “

—Collections

.”


Customer Account Management

We regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts. This ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with respect to their account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. To monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio (including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties), we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date. Proprietary risk models, together with the credit scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly, are an integral part of our credit decision-making process. Depending on the duration of the customer’s account, risk profile and other performance metrics, the account may be subject to a range of account actions, including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits.

Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions

Once an account has been opened, when a credit card is used to make a purchase in-store at one of our partners’ locations or online, point-of-sale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system, which allows for real-time updating of accounts. Each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system, which considers a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined, and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted.

Fraud Investigation

We provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings, new account fraud and transactional fraud. We have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern. Our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers. We also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud such as utilizing embedded security chips ("EMV") for our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card products with all our retail partners.

Collections

All monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts. Collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due. The nature and the timing of the initial contact, typically a personal call, e-mail, text message or letter, are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits.

We re-evaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques, including internal collection activities, use of external vendors and the sale of debt to third-party buyers, as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent. We limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes, the imposition of credit limits and criteria-based account suspension and revocation processes. In certain situations, we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules, decrease interest rates and/or waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us.

Customer Service

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners. Our customers can contact us via phone, mail, email, eService and eChat. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we handled over

300 million

inquiries.

We assign a dedicated toll-free customer service phone number to each of our Retail Card programs. Our Payment Solutions customers access customer service through one general purpose toll-free customer service phone number (except for a few large Payment Solutions programs, which have dedicated toll-free numbers). Our CareCredit platform has its own, dedicated toll-free customer service phone number. We also have dedicated toll-free customer service phone numbers for our deposit business.


We service all programs through our nine domestic and three off-shore call centers. We blend domestic and off-shore locations as an important part of our servicing strategy, to maintain service availability beyond normal work hours in the United States and to seek optimal costs. Customer service for cards issued to customers in Canada is supported through agents based in the United States.

Given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls, we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across all of our sites. Examples of these centers of excellence include back office, quality assurance, customer experience, training, workforce and capacity planning, surveillance and process control.

Production Services

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our production services organization oversees a number of services, including:

•

payment processing (more than

700 million

paper and electronic payments in


);

•

embossing and mailing credit cards (more than

50 million

cards in


);

•

printing and mailing and eService delivery of credit card statements (more than

750 million

paper and electronic statements in


); and

•

other letters mailed or sent electronically (more than

90 million

in


).

In December 2019, our payment processing services were outsourced to a third party under a multi-year agreement. U.S. credit card statement printing and mailing, card embossing and mailing and letter production and mailing for customers are provided through outsourced services with Fiserv. While these services are outsourced, we monitor and maintain oversight of these other services. Fiserv also produces our statements and other mailings for deposit customers.

Card production embossing, mailing, statement printing and mailing services related to cards issued to customers in Canada are outsourced to Canadian suppliers.

Technology and Data Security

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Products and Services

We leverage information technology to deliver products and services that meet the needs of our customers and partners and enables us to operate our business efficiently. The integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition, enabling, among other things, customers to “apply and buy” at the point of sale, and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee. A key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative, efficient, flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing, risk management, account acquisition and account management, customer service, and new product innovation and development. We believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities, reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Therefore, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our business needs.

As part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technological capabilities, we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with third-party providers. Our internal approach involves deployment of cross-functional product teams, often in collaboration with our partners, focused on driving rapid delivery of in-house product innovation and development, and the commercialization of new products. In addition, at times we also partner with third-party providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and, in some cases, architecture, designed by us. We leverage Fiserv (including their recent acquisition of First Data) for our credit card transaction processing and production and our retail banking operations.


Data Security

The protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities. We have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards that we believe provide an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our Company's and our customers' information. This includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information, and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information.

Our information security program is continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology. Through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment, security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis. We work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the Company.

We have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets. Our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store, process or have access to sensitive data, and we require the same level of protection from such third-party service providers. We evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement.

In addition, we identify risks that may threaten customer information and utilize both internal and external resources to perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services. We employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing, processing and transferring customer information, and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans. Further, we regularly utilize independent assessors to evaluate the appropriateness of our overall program. We are compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) program.

Intellectual Property

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We use a variety of methods, such as trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property, including our brand, "Synchrony." We also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures. Our brands are important assets, and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation.

Employees

____________________________________________________________________________________________

At

December 31, 2019

, we had over

16,500

full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any material employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. We also have relationships with third-party call center providers in the United States and other countries that provide us with additional contractors for customer service, collections and other functions.

Regulation

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel.

As a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB.


The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the “OCC”), which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC. For a discussion of the specific regulations related to our business see “

Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business

” of this Form 10-K Report.

Competition

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our industry continues to be highly competitive. We compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as Alliance Data Systems, American Express, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, financial technology companies and potential partners’ own in-house financing capabilities. We compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing expertise, service levels, product and service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation. In addition, some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account approval), customer service and collections, and other core banking responsibilities that we retain.

We also compete for customer usage of our credit products. Consumer credit provided, and credit card payments made, using our cards constitute only a small percentage of overall consumer credit provided and credit card payments in the United States. Consumers have numerous financing and payment options available to them. As a form of payment, our products compete with cash, checks, debit cards, Visa and MasterCard credit cards, as well as American Express, Discover Card, other private-label card brands, and, to a certain extent, prepaid cards. In the future, we expect our products may face increased competition from new emerging payment technologies, such as Apple Pay, Chase Pay, Samsung Pay and Square, to the extent that our products are not, or do not continue to be, accepted in, or compatible with, such technologies. We may also face increased competition from current competitors or others who introduce or embrace disruptive technology that significantly changes the consumer credit and payment industry. We compete for customers and their usage of our deposit products, and to minimize transfers to competitors of our customers’ outstanding balances, based on a number of factors, including pricing (interest rates and fees), product offerings, credit limits, incentives (including loyalty programs) and customer service. Some of our competitors provide a broader selection of services, including home and automobile loans, debit cards and bank branch ATM access, which may position them better among customers who prefer to use a single financial institution to meet all of their financial needs. In addition, some of our competitors are substantially larger than we are, may have substantially greater resources than we do or may offer a broader range of products and services than we do. Moreover, some of our competitors, including new and emerging competitors in the digital and mobile payments space, are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or legislative scrutiny to which we are subject, which also could place us at a competitive disadvantage.

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct-banking competitors. We compete for deposits with traditional banks, and in seeking to grow our direct-banking business, we compete with other banks that have direct-banking models similar to ours, such as Ally Financial, American Express, Capital One 360 (ING), CIT, Discover, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, PurePoint, Sallie Mae and United Services Automobile Association (“USAA"). Competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors.

Business Trends and Conditions

We believe our business and results of operations will be impacted in the future by various trends and conditions, including the following:

•

Growth in loan receivables and interest income

. We believe continuing stability in the U.S. economy and employment rates will contribute to an increase in consumer credit spending. In addition, we expect the use of credit cards to continue to increase versus other forms of payment such as cash and checks. We anticipate that these trends, combined with our marketing and partner engagement strategies, will contribute to growth in our loan receivables. In the near-to-medium term, we expect our total interest income to continue to grow, driven by the expected growth in average loan receivables. Our historical growth rates in loan receivables and interest income have benefited from new partner acquisitions, and therefore, if we do not continue to acquire new partners, replace the programs that are not extended or otherwise grow our business, our growth rates in loan receivables and interest income in the future will be lower than in recent periods. In October 2019, we completed the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio. Due to the timing of our prior reclassification of these loan receivables as loan receivables held for sale on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in the first quarter of 2019, the sale will not impact our loan receivable growth in 2020. However, we do expect the sale to result in reductions in both our interest income and the yields generated from our loan receivables. For our ongoing programs, we do not expect to make any significant changes to customer pricing or merchant discount pricing in the near term other than those associated with changes in the prime rate and London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), and therefore we expect yields generated from interest and fees on loan receivables will remain relatively stable.

Adoption of ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (

“

CECL

”

).

We have adopted the new accounting standard for credit losses effective January 1, 2020. This new guidance replaces the existing incurred loss impairment guidance with a new impairment model known as the Current Expected Credit Loss (“CECL”) model, which is based on expected credit losses. While we continue to finalize our estimate and assumptions, we estimate the adoption will result in an increase of approximately $3.0 billion, or 54%, to the Company’s allowance for loan losses. This will also result in a corresponding significant increase to our allowance coverage ratio. As required under the new guidance, upon adoption in the first quarter of 2020, we will record a net decrease to retained earnings in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position of approximately $2.3 billion

.

Such decrease will also result in a reduction in the Company’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of approximately 60 basis points per year, during the phase-in period permitted by the federal banking agencies, which runs through 2023. Following adoption of the new CECL guidance, upon origination of a loan, the estimate of expected credit losses, and any subsequent changes to our estimates of total expected losses for our loan receivables, will be recorded through provision for loan losses in our Consolidated Statement of Earnings.

•

Asset quality.

In 2019, net charge-off rates were relatively flat compared to 2018, increasing slightly by

2 basis points

to

5.65%

for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, reflecting stable U.S. unemployment rates and consumer confidence. Delinquency metrics improved at

December 31, 2019

compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily driven by the effects of the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio. The assessment of our credit profile includes the evaluation of portfolio mix, account maturation, as well as broader consumer trends, such as payment behavior and overall indebtedness. We expect our net charge-off rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 to decrease slightly from 2019, primarily due to the effects of the Walmart consumer portfolio sale. We expect credit trends in the near term for our ongoing portfolio to be relatively stable. However, we do expect Provision for Loan Losses in our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position to increase in 2020 due to two significant factors that do not impact the asset quality of our ongoing programs. The increase will be driven by the comparability to the reductions in reserves experienced in 2019 related to the Walmart portfolio and also from the effects of the new CECL guidance discussed above.


•

Retailer share arrangement payments under our program agreements.

We believe that the payments we make to our partners under our retailer share arrangements, for our on-going programs, in the aggregate, are likely to increase in absolute terms compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of both the overall growth, mix and the performance of our programs. This increase is expected to be largely offset by the impact of the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio. See

Management’s Discussion and Analysis—Retailer Share Arrangements

for additional information on these agreements.

•

Extended duration of our Retail Card program agreements

. Our Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years, and the average length of our relationship with our Retail Card partners is


years. We expect to continue to benefit from these programs on a long-term basis.

A total of


of our


ongoing Retail Card program agreements have an expiration date in 2022 or beyond. These


program agreements represented in the aggregate

98%

of both our Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended

December 31, 2019

and of our Retail Card loan receivables at

December 31, 2019

attributable to our ongoing programs.

•

Growth in interchange revenues and loyalty program costs.

We believe that as a result of the overall growth in Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card transactions occurring outside of our Retail Card partners’ locations, interchange revenues will continue to increase in excess of the growth of our Retail Card loan receivables. The expected growth in these transactions is driven, in part, by both existing and new loyalty programs with our Retail Card partners. In addition, we continue to offer and add new loyalty programs for our private label credit cards, for which we typically do not receive interchange fees. The growth in these existing and new loyalty programs will result in an increase in costs associated with these programs. Overall, we expect our loyalty program costs to continue to be largely offset by our interchange revenues. These changes have been contemplated in our program agreements with our Retail Card partners and are a component of the calculation of our payments due under our retailer share arrangements.

•

Capital and liquidity levels.

We continue to expect to maintain sufficient capital and liquidity resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, and our credit ratings as well as regulatory and compliance requirements in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments. During the year ended

December 31, 2019

, we declared and paid dividends of

$581 million

and repurchased

$3.6 billion

of our outstanding common stock. We plan to continue to deploy capital through both dividends and share repurchases subject to regulatory approval, as well as to support business growth. In the fourth quarter of 2019 we also issued depositary shares representing $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with dividends payable quarterly beginning in February 2020. While we expect to see the adverse impact from CECL discussed above, we continue to expect to maintain capital ratios well in excess of minimum regulatory requirements. At

December 31, 2019

, the Company had a Basel III common equity Tier 1 ratio of

14.1%

. We expect that our liquidity portfolio will continue to be sufficient to support all of our business objectives and to meet all regulatory requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2019, we held excess liquidity of approximately $3.0 billion due to the recent proceeds from the Walmart consumer portfolio sale. We expect to deploy this excess capital during the first half of 2020, and we believe our net interest margin will decrease as a result of this excess liquidity held for part of the year.

Seasonality

In our Retail Card and Payment Solutions platforms, we experience fluctuations in transaction volumes and the level of loan receivables as a result of higher seasonal consumer spending and payment patterns that typically result in an increase of loan receivables from August through a peak in late December, with reductions in loan receivables occurring over the first and second quarters of the following year as customers pay their balances down.

The seasonal impact to transaction volumes and the loan receivables balance typically results in fluctuations in our results of operations, delinquency metrics and the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables between quarterly periods. These fluctuations are generally most evident between the fourth quarter and the first quarter of the following year.


In addition to the seasonal variance in loan receivables discussed above, we also experience a seasonal increase in delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances during the third and fourth quarters of each year due to lower customer payment rates resulting in higher net charge-off rates in the first and second quarters. Our delinquency rates and delinquent loan receivables balances typically decrease during the subsequent first and second quarters as customers begin to pay down their loan balances and return to current status resulting in lower net charge-off rates in the third and fourth quarters. Because customers who were delinquent during the fourth quarter of a calendar year have a higher probability of returning to current status when compared to customers who are delinquent at the end of each of our interim reporting periods, we expect that a higher proportion of delinquent accounts outstanding at an interim period end will result in charge-offs, as compared to delinquent accounts outstanding at a year end. Consistent with this historical experience, we generally experience a higher allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loan receivables at the end of an interim period, as compared to the end of a calendar year. In addition, despite improving credit metrics such as declining past due amounts, we may experience an increase in our allowance for loan losses at an interim period end compared to the prior year end, reflecting these same seasonal trends.

Interest Income

Interest income is comprised of interest and fees on loans, which includes merchant discounts provided by partners to compensate us in almost all cases for all or part of the promotional financing provided to their customers, and interest on cash and equivalents and investment securities. We include in interest and fees on loans any past due interest and fees deemed to be collectible. Direct loan origination costs on credit card loans are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over a one-year period and recorded in interest and fees on loans. For non-credit card receivables, direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized over the life of the loan and recorded in interest and fees on loans.

We analyze interest income as a function of two principal components: average interest-earning assets and yield on average interest-earning assets. Key drivers of average interest-earning assets include:

•

purchase volumes, which are influenced by a number of factors including macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence generally, our partners’ sales and our ability to increase our share of those sales;

•

payment rates, reflecting the extent to which customers maintain a credit balance;

•

charge-offs, reflecting the receivables that are deemed not to be collectible;

•

the size of our liquidity portfolio; and

•

portfolio acquisitions when we enter into new partner relationships.

Key drivers of yield on average interest-earning assets include:

•

pricing (contractual rates of interest, movement in prime rates, late fees and merchant discount rates);

•

changes to our mix of loans (e.g., the number of loans bearing promotional rates as compared to standard rates);

•

frequency of late fees incurred when account holders fail to make their minimum payment by the required due date;

•

credit performance and accrual status of our loans; and

•

yield earned on our liquidity portfolio.

Interest income

increased

by

$1,102 million

, or

6.1%

, for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

. The increase was driven primarily by growth in our average loan receivables.


Average interest-earning assets

The increase in average loan receivables of

6.4%

for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

was driven by higher purchase volume and average active account growth, which included the full year impact from the 2018 PayPal Credit acquisition, partially offset by the Walmart consumer portfolio sale in October 2019. Purchase volume and average active accounts

increased

6.2%

and

2.5%

, respectively, including the effects of the PayPal Credit acquisition and the Walmart consumer portfolio sale.

Yield on average interest-earning assets

The yield on average interest-earning assets

increased

for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

primarily due to an increase in the percentage of interest-earning assets attributable to loan receivables. The yield on average loan receivables, including held for sale,

decrease

d


basis points to

21.10%

for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

.

Interest Expense

Interest expense is incurred on our interest-bearing liabilities, which consisted of interest-bearing deposit accounts, borrowings of consolidated securitization entities and senior unsecured notes.

Key drivers of interest expense include:

•

the amounts outstanding of our deposits and borrowings;

•

the interest rate environment and its effect on interest rates paid on our funding sources; and

•

the changing mix in our funding sources.

Interest expense

increased

by

$421 million

, or

22.5%

, for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily driven by higher benchmark interest rates and growth in our deposit liabilities. Our cost of funds

increased

to

2.66%

for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

compared to

2.30%

for the

year ended

December 31, 2018

.

Average interest-bearing liabilities

The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended

December 31, 2019

was primarily driven by growth in our direct deposits.

Net Interest Income

Net interest income represents the difference between interest income and interest expense.

Net interest income

increased

by

$681

million, or

4.2%

, for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily driven by higher average loan receivables, partially offset by the Walmart consumer portfolio sale and increases in interest expense reflecting higher benchmark interest rates and growth in our deposit liabilities.


Retailer Share Arrangements

Most of our Retail Card program agreements and certain other program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partners if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually defined threshold. We also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these arrangements are designed to align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products. Although the retailer share arrangements vary by partner, these arrangements are generally structured to measure the economic performance of the program, based typically on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses), and share portions of this amount above a negotiated threshold. The threshold and economic performance of a program that are used to calculate payments to our partners may be based on, among other things, agreed upon measures of program expenses rather than our actual expenses, and therefore increases in our actual expenses (such as funding costs or operating expenses) may not necessarily result in reduced payments under our retailer share arrangements. These arrangements are typically designed to permit us to achieve an economic return before we are required to make payments to our partners based on the agreed contractually defined threshold. Our payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements have generally increased in recent years, primarily as a result of the growth and performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements, as well as changes to the terms of certain program agreements that have been renegotiated in the past few years.

We believe that our retailer share arrangements have been effective in helping us to grow our business by aligning our partners’ interests with ours. We also believe that the changes to the terms of certain program agreements in recent years will help us to grow our business by providing an additional incentive to the relevant partners to promote our credit products going forward. Payments to partners pursuant to these retailer share arrangements would generally decrease, and mitigate the impact on our profitability, in the event of declines in the performance of the programs or the occurrence of other unfavorable developments that impact the calculation of payments to our partners pursuant to our retailer share arrangements.

Retailer share arrangements

increased

by

$759

million, or

24.5%

, for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily due to growth and improved performance of the programs in which we have retailer share arrangements.

Provision for Loan Losses

Provision for loan losses is the expense related to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level to absorb the estimated probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at each period end date. Provision for loan losses in each period is a function of net charge-offs (gross charge-offs net of recoveries) and the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Our process to determine our allowance for loan losses is based upon our estimate of the incurred loss period for each type of loss (i.e., aged, fraud, deceased, settlement, other non-aged and bankruptcy). See “

Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Loan Losses”

and Note 2.

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our allowance for loan loss methodology.

Provision for loan losses

decreased

by

$1,365 million

, or

24.6%

, for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily driven by reductions in reserves for loan losses related to the Walmart consumer portfolio sale which was completed in October 2019. The reductions totaled $1,133 million for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

. The remaining decrease was primarily driven by lower reserve build, partially offset by higher net charge-offs. Our allowance coverage ratio

decreased

to

6.42%

at

December 31, 2019

, as compared to

6.90%

at

December 31, 2018

.


Other Income

Interchange revenue

We earn interchange fees on Dual Card and other co-branded credit card transactions outside of our partners’ sales channels, based on a flat fee plus a percent of the purchase amount. Growth in interchange revenue has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven primarily by growth in our Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card products.

Interchange revenue

increased

by

$38 million

, or

5.4%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, driven by increases in purchase volume outside of our retail partners' sales channels.

Debt cancellation fees

Debt cancellation fees relate to payment protection products purchased by our credit card customers. Customers who choose to purchase these products are charged a monthly fee based on their account balance. In return, we will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events. We offer our debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail.

Debt cancellation fees remained relatively flat for the year ended

December 31, 2019

.

Loyalty programs

We operate a number of loyalty programs primarily in our Retail Card platform that are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card and strengthening cardholder loyalty. These programs typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. Growth in loyalty program payments has been, and is expected to continue to be, driven by growth in purchase volume related to existing loyalty programs and the rollout of new loyalty programs.

Loyalty programs cost

decreased

slightly by

$8 million

, or

1.1%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily as a result of the Walmart consumer portfolio sale, partially offset by growth in purchase volume related to our remaining loyalty programs.

Other

Other includes a variety of items including ancillary fees, commission fees related to Pets Best, realized gains or losses associated with investments and sales of assets and changes in contingent consideration obligations.

Other

increased

by

$62 million

, or

159.0%

, for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

primarily due to reductions in certain contingent consideration obligations and commission fees related to Pets Best.


Other Expense

Employee costs

Employee costs primarily consist of employee compensation and benefit costs.

Employee costs

increased

by

$28 million

, or

2.0%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, which included a restructuring charge of $21 million incurred in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Professional fees

Professional fees consist primarily of outsourced provider fees (e.g., collection agencies and call centers), legal, accounting, consulting, and recruiting expenses.

Professional fees

increased

by

$61 million

, or

7.6%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily due to interim servicing costs associated with acquired portfolios.

Marketing and business development

Marketing and business development costs consist primarily of our contractual and discretionary marketing and business development spend, as well as amortization expense associated with retail partner contract acquisitions and extensions.

Marketing and business development costs

increased

by

$21 million

, or

4.0%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily due to strategic investments in our sales platforms.

Information processing

Information processing costs primarily consist of fees related to outsourced information processing providers, credit card associations and software licensing agreements.

Information processing costs

increased

by

$59 million

, or

13.8%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily due to higher amortization of capitalized software related to both business growth and strategic investments.

Other

Other primarily consists of postage, operational losses, litigation and regulatory matters expense and various other corporate overhead items such as facilities' costs and telephone charges. Postage is driven primarily by the number of our active accounts and the percentage of customers that utilize our electronic billing option. Fraud, or operational losses, are driven primarily by the number of our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card accounts.

The “other” component

decreased

by

$19 million

, or

2.1%

, for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, primarily due to lower corporate overhead costs.


Provision for Income Taxes

The effective tax rate for the year ended

December 31, 2019

, was comparable to the prior year. The effective tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to state income taxes.

Platform Analysis

As discussed above under “

Our Business—Our Sales Platforms

,” we offer our products through three sales platforms (Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit), which management measures based on their revenue-generating activities. The following is a discussion of certain supplemental information for the

year ended

December 31, 2019

, for each of our sales platforms.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2019, our oil and gas retail credit programs, previously reported within our Retail Card sales platform, are now reported within our Payment Solutions sales platform. We have recast all prior-period reported metrics for our Retail Card and Payment Solutions sales platforms to conform to the current-period presentation.

Loan Receivables

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Loan receivables are our largest category of assets and represent our primary source of revenues. The following discussion provides supplemental information regarding our loan receivables portfolio. See Note 2.

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

and Note 4.

Loan Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our Loan Receivables, including impaired loans and troubled debt restructurings.

Our loan receivables portfolio, excluding held for sale, had the following maturity distribution at

December 31, 2019

.

______________________

(1)

Credit card loans have minimum payment requirements but no stated maturity and therefore are included in the due within one year category. However, many of our credit card holders will revolve their balances, which may extend their repayment period beyond one year for balances at

December 31, 2019

.

(2)

Credit card and commercial loans due after one year relate to Troubled Debt Restructuring ("TDR") assets.

(3)

Reflects scheduled repayments up to the final contractual maturity of our installment loans.

Our loan receivables portfolio had the following geographic concentration at

December 31, 2019

.

Delinquencies

Over-30 day loan delinquencies as a percentage of period-end loan receivables

decreased

to

4.44%

at

December 31, 2019

, as compared to

4.76%

at

December 31, 2018

. The


basis point decrease in


compared to the same period in the prior year was driven by effects of the sale of the Walmart consumer portfolio.

Net Charge-Offs

Net charge-offs consist of the unpaid principal balance of loans held for investment that we determine are uncollectible, net of recovered amounts. We exclude accrued and unpaid finance charges and fees and third-party fraud losses from charge-offs. Charged-off and recovered finance charges and fees are included in interest and fees on loans while third-party fraud losses are included in other expense. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to the allowance for loan losses and subsequent recoveries of previously charged-off amounts are credited to the allowance for loan losses. Costs incurred to recover charged-off loans are recorded as collection expense and included in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.


The table below sets forth the ratio of net charge-offs to average loan receivables, including held for sale, (“net charge-off rate”) for the periods indicated.

Funding, Liquidity and Capital Resources

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We maintain a strong focus on liquidity and capital. Our funding, liquidity and capital policies are designed to ensure that our business has the liquidity and capital resources to support our daily operations, our business growth, our credit ratings and our regulatory and policy requirements, in a cost effective and prudent manner through expected and unexpected market environments.

Funding Sources

Our primary funding sources include cash from operations, deposits (direct and brokered deposits), securitized financings and senior unsecured notes.

The following table summarizes information concerning our funding sources during the periods indicated:

______________________

(1)

Excludes

$280 million

,

$282 million

and

$227 million

average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


, respectively. Non-interest-bearing deposits comprise less than 10% of total deposits for the years ended

December 31, 2019

,


and


.

Deposits

We obtain deposits directly from retail and commercial customers (“direct deposits”) or through third-party brokerage firms that offer our deposits to their customers (“brokered deposits”). At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$54.2 billion

in direct deposits and

$10.9 billion

in deposits originated through brokerage firms (including network deposit sweeps procured through a program arranger that channels brokerage account deposits to us). A key part of our liquidity plan and funding strategy is to continue to expand our direct deposits base as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding.

Our direct deposits include a range of FDIC-insured deposit products, including certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts.

Brokered deposits are primarily from retail customers of large brokerage firms. We have relationships with


brokers that offer our deposits through their networks. Our brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposit that bear interest at a fixed rate and at

December 31, 2019

, had a weighted average remaining life of

2.2

years. These deposits generally are not subject to early withdrawal.

Our ability to attract deposits is sensitive to, among other things, the interest rates we pay, and therefore, we bear funding risk if we fail to pay higher rates, or interest rate risk if we are required to pay higher rates, to retain existing deposits or attract new deposits. To mitigate these risks, our funding strategy includes a range of deposit products, and we seek to maintain access to multiple other funding sources, including securitized financings (including our undrawn committed capacity) and unsecured debt.


The following table summarizes certain information regarding our interest-bearing deposits by type (all of which constitute U.S. deposits) for the periods indicated:

Our deposit liabilities provide funding with maturities ranging from one day to ten years. At

December 31, 2019

, the weighted average maturity of our interest-bearing time deposits was

1.1

years. See Note 7.

Deposits

Includes brokered certificates of deposit for which underlying individual deposit balances are assumed to be less than $250,000.

(2)

The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor, for each account ownership category. Deposits in excess of FDIC insurance limit presented above include partially uninsured accounts.

Securitized Financings

We have been engaged in the securitization of our credit card receivables since 1997. We access the asset-backed securitization market using the Synchrony Credit Card Master Note Trust (“SYNCT”) and the Synchrony Card Issuance Trust (“SYNIT”) through which we issue asset-backed securities through both public transactions and private transactions funded by financial institutions and commercial paper conduits. In addition, we issue asset-backed securities in private transactions through the Synchrony Sales Finance Master Trust (“SFT”).

At

December 31, 2019

, we had

$2.9 billion

of outstanding private asset-backed securities and

$7.5 billion

of outstanding public asset-backed securities, in each case held by unrelated third parties.


The following table summarizes expected contractual maturities of the investors’ interests in securitized financings, excluding debt premiums, discounts and issuance costs at

December 31, 2019

.

______________________

(1)

Excludes any subordinated classes of SYNCT notes and SYNIT notes that we owned at

December 31, 2019

.

We retain exposure to the performance of trust assets through: (i) in the case of SYNCT, SFT and SYNIT, subordinated retained interests in the loan receivables transferred to the trust in excess of the principal amount of the notes for a given series that provide credit enhancement for a particular series, as well as a pari passu seller’s interest in each trust and (ii) in the case of SYNCT and SYNIT, any subordinated classes of notes that we own.

All of our securitized financings include early repayment triggers, referred to as early amortization events, including events related to material breaches of representations, warranties or covenants, inability or failure of the Bank to transfer loan receivables to the trusts as required under the securitization documents, failure to make required payments or deposits pursuant to the securitization documents, and certain insolvency-related events with respect to the related securitization depositor, Synchrony (solely with respect to SYNCT) or the Bank. In addition, an early amortization event will occur with respect to a series if the excess spread as it relates to a particular series or for the trust, as applicable, falls below zero. Following an early amortization event, principal collections on the loan receivables in the applicable trust are applied to repay principal of the trust's asset-backed securities rather than being available on a revolving basis to fund the origination activities of our business. The occurrence of an early amortization event also would limit or terminate our ability to issue future series out of the trust in which the early amortization event occurred. No early amortization event has occurred with respect to any of the securitized financings in SYNCT, SFT or SYNIT.

The following table summarizes for each of our trusts the three-month rolling average excess spread at

December 31, 2019

.

Weighted average interest rate of all senior unsecured notes at

December 31, 2019

was

3.75%

(2)

The amounts shown exclude unamortized debt discounts, premiums and issuance costs.

Short-Term Borrowings

Except as described above, there were no material short-term borrowings for the periods presented.

Other

At

December 31, 2019

, we had more than

$25.0 billion

of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.

Covenants

The indenture pursuant to which our senior unsecured notes have been issued includes various covenants, including covenants that restrict (subject to certain exceptions) Synchrony’s ability to dispose of, or incur liens on, any of the voting stock of the Bank or otherwise permit the Bank to be merged, consolidated, leased or sold in a manner that results in the Bank being less than 80% controlled by us.


If we do not satisfy any of these covenants discussed above, the maturity of amounts outstanding thereunder may be accelerated and become payable. We were in compliance with all of these covenants at

December 31, 2019

.

At

December 31, 2019

, we were not in default under any of our credit facilities.

Credit Ratings

Our borrowing costs and capacity in certain funding markets, including securitizations and senior and subordinated debt, may be affected by the credit ratings of the Company, the Bank and the ratings of our asset-backed securities.

The table below reflects our current credit ratings and outlooks:

In addition, certain of the asset-backed securities issued by SYNCT and SYNIT are rated by Fitch, S&P and/or Moody’s. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Downgrades in these credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets.

Liquidity

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We seek to ensure that we have adequate liquidity to sustain business operations, fund asset growth, satisfy debt obligations and to meet regulatory expectations under normal and stress conditions.

We maintain policies outlining the overall framework and general principles for managing liquidity risk across our business, which is the responsibility of our Asset and Liability Management Committee, a subcommittee of the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. We employ a variety of metrics to monitor and manage liquidity. We perform regular liquidity stress testing and contingency planning as part of our liquidity management process. We evaluate a range of stress scenarios including Company specific and systemic events that could impact funding sources and our ability to meet liquidity needs.

We maintain a liquidity portfolio, which at

December 31, 2019

had

$17.3 billion

of liquid assets, primarily consisting of cash and equivalents and short-term obligations of the U.S. Treasury, less cash in transit which is not considered to be liquid, compared to

$14.8 billion

of liquid assets at

December 31, 2018

. The increase in liquid assets was primarily due to excess liquidity of approximately $3.0 billion we are holding from the proceeds from the sale of the Walmart portfolio. In October 2019, we completed our sale of $8.2 billion of loan receivables associated with our Retail Card program agreement with Walmart.

As additional sources of liquidity, at

December 31, 2019

, we had an aggregate of

$5.6 billion

of undrawn committed capacity on our securitized financings, subject to customary borrowing conditions, from private lenders under our securitization programs and

$0.5 billion

of undrawn committed capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility with private lenders, and we had more than

$25.0 billion

of unencumbered assets in the Bank available to be used to generate additional liquidity through secured borrowings or asset sales or to be pledged to the Federal Reserve Board for credit at the discount window.


As a general matter, investments included in our liquidity portfolio are expected to be highly liquid, giving us the ability to readily convert them to cash. The level and composition of our liquidity portfolio may fluctuate based upon the level of expected maturities of our funding sources as well as operational requirements and market conditions.

We rely significantly on dividends and other distributions and payments from the Bank for liquidity; however, bank regulations, contractual restrictions and other factors limit the amount of dividends and other distributions and payments that the Bank may pay to us. For a discussion of regulatory restrictions on the Bank’s ability to pay dividends, see “

Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. We are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates. See “

Risks—Risk Factors Relating to Our Business—Changes in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings, funding and liquidity

” and “

—A reduction in our credit ratings could materially increase the cost of our funding from, and restrict our access to, the capital markets

.”

Interest Rate Risk

We borrow money from a variety of depositors and institutions in order to provide loans to our customers. Changes in market interest rates cause our net interest income to increase or decrease, as some of our assets and liabilities carry interest rates that fluctuate with market benchmarks. The interest rate benchmark for our floating rate assets is generally the prime rate, and the interest rate benchmark for our floating rate liabilities is generally either LIBOR or the federal funds rate. The prime rate and the LIBOR or federal funds rate could reset at different times or could diverge, leading to mismatches in the interest rates on our floating rate assets and floating rate liabilities.

Competitive factors and future regulatory reform may limit or restrict our ability to raise interest rates on our loans. In addition, some of our program agreements limit the rate of interest we can charge to customers. If interest rates were to rise materially over a sustained period of time, and we are unable to sufficiently raise our interest rates in a timely manner, our net interest income and margin could be adversely impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.

Interest rates may also adversely impact our customers’ spending levels and ability and willingness to pay outstanding amounts owed to us. Our floating rate products bear interest rates that fluctuate with the prime rate. Higher interest rates often lead to higher payment obligations by customers to us and other lenders under mortgage, credit card and other consumer loans, which may reduce our customers’ ability to remain current on their obligations to us and therefore lead to increased delinquencies, charge-offs and allowances for loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings.

Changes in interest rates and competitor responses to these changes may also impact customer decisions to maintain deposits with us, and reductions in deposits could materially adversely affect our funding costs and liquidity.

At December 31, 2019

,

54.3%

of our loan receivables were priced at a fixed interest rate to the customer, with the remaining

45.7%

at a floating interest rate. We fund our assets with a combination of fixed rate and floating rate funding sources that include deposits, asset-backed securities and unsecured debt. To manage interest rate risk, we seek to match the interest rate repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not used interest rate derivative contracts to manage interest rate risk; however, we may choose to do so in the future. To the extent we are unable to effectively match the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities, our net earnings could be materially adversely affected.

We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of various interest rate scenarios on our net interest income.


For purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical, adverse change in interest rates over the 12-month period from our reporting date, we assume that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical, immediate 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates as of the beginning of the period. The sensitivity is based upon the hypothetical assumption that all relevant types of interest rates that affect our results would increase or decrease instantaneously, simultaneously and to the same degree.

Our interest rate sensitive assets include our variable rate loan receivables and the assets that make up our liquidity portfolio.

At December 31, 2019

,

45.7%

of our receivables were priced at a floating interest rate. Assets with rates that are fixed at period end but which will mature, or otherwise contractually reset to a market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, are considered to be rate sensitive. The latter category includes certain loans that may be offered at below-market rates for an introductory period, such as balance transfers and special promotional programs, after which the loans will contractually reprice under standard terms in accordance with our normal market-based pricing structure. For purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans, only the effect of the hypothetical 100 basis point change in the underlying market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice (i.e. assets are categorized as fixed or floating according to their underlying contractual terms). For assets that have a fixed interest rate at the period end but which contractually will, or are assumed to, reset to a market-based indexed rate or other fixed rate during the next 12 months, net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.

Interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next 12-month period. Thus, liabilities that vary with changes in a market-based index, such as the federal funds rate or LIBOR, which will reset before the end of the 12-month period, or liabilities whose rates are fixed at the period end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market-based indexed rate prior to the end of the 12-month period, also are considered to be rate sensitive. For these fixed rate liabilities, net interest income sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date.

The following table presents the approximate net interest income impacts forecasted over the next twelve months from an immediate and parallel change in interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at

December 31, 2019

.

Limitations of Market Risk Measures

The interest rate risk models that we use in deriving these measures incorporate contractual information, internally-developed assumptions and proprietary modeling methodologies, which project borrower and deposit behavior patterns in certain interest rate environments. Other market inputs, such as interest rates, market prices and interest rate volatility, are also critical components of our interest rate risk measures. We regularly evaluate, update and enhance these assumptions, models and analytical tools as we believe appropriate to reflect our best assessment of the market environment and the expected behavior patterns of our existing assets and liabilities.

There are inherent limitations in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates. The sensitivity analysis provided above contemplates only certain movements in interest rates and is based on the existing balance sheet as well as assumptions around future growth, pricing and balance sheet composition. It does not attempt to estimate the effect of a more significant interest rate increase over a sustained period of time, which as described in “

—Interest Rate Risk

” above, could adversely affect our net interest income. In addition, the strategic actions that management may take to manage our balance sheet may differ from our projections, which could cause our actual net interest income to differ from the above sensitivity analysis.


Capital

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our primary sources of capital have been earnings generated by our business and existing equity capital. We seek to manage capital to a level and composition sufficient to support the risks of our business, meet regulatory requirements, adhere to rating agency targets and support future business growth. The level, composition and utilization of capital are influenced by changes in the economic environment, strategic initiatives and legislative and regulatory developments. Within these constraints, we are focused on deploying capital in a manner that will provide attractive returns to our stockholders.

Synchrony is not currently required to conduct stress tests. See “

Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Legislative and Regulatory Developments

.” In addition, while as a savings and loan holding company, we have not been subject to the Federal Reserve Board's capital planning rule to-date, we have submitted a capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board in


. While not required, our capital plan process does include certain internal stress testing. See “

Regulation—Regulation Relating to Our Business—Legislative and Regulatory Developments

”, for discussion of the final rules issued by the Federal Reserve Board on October 10, 2019, related to the Federal Reserve Boards enhanced prudential standards and their applicability to savings and loan holding companies.

Dividend and Share Repurchases

On May 9, 2019, we announced that our Board plans to increase our quarterly dividend to $0.22 per common share commencing in the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2019, we issued depositary shares representing $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, with dividends payable quarterly, beginning in February 2020. The declaration and payment of future dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock will be at the discretion of the Board and will depend on many factors. For a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, see “

Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—We are subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends and repurchase its common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to Synchrony, which could limit Synchrony's ability to pay dividends, repurchase its common stock or make payments on its indebtedness.

”

In March 2019, we completed our 2018 Share Repurchase Program. On May 9, 2019, we announced our Board's approval of a new share repurchase program of up to $4.0 billion through June 30, 2020 (the “2019 Share Repurchase Program”).


Through the end of 2019, we have repurchased approximately $2.7 billion of common stock as part of the 2019 Share Repurchase Program and expect to complete the share repurchase program by the end of the second quarter of 2020. We made and expect to continue to make, share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors, including legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Financial

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to maintain minimum capital ratios, under the applicable U.S. Basel III capital rules. For more information, see “

Regulation—Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation

.”

For Synchrony Financial to be a well-capitalized savings and loan holding company, Synchrony Bank must be well-capitalized and Synchrony Financial must not be subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the Federal Reserve Board to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. As of

December 31, 2019

and


, Synchrony Financial met all the requirements to be deemed well-capitalized.

The following table sets forth the composition of our capital ratios for the Company calculated under the Basel III Standardized Approach rules at

December 31, 2019

and


, respectively.

______________________

(1)

Tier 1 leverage ratio represents total tier 1 capital as a percentage of total average assets, after certain adjustments. All other ratios presented above represent the applicable capital measure as a percentage of risk-weighted assets.

The slight increase in our Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio compared to the prior year was primarily due a decrease in loan receivables and corresponding decline in our risk-weighted assets as a result of the Walmart portfolio sale, partially offset by dividends and share repurchases. The increase in our Tier 1 capital ratio was primarily due to our issuance of depositary shares representing $750 million of non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock in the fourth quarter of 2019, and the factors outlined above.

Regulatory Capital Requirements - Synchrony Bank

Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in the initiation of certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could limit our business activities and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “

Regulation—Risk Factors Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us

.”

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Unfunded Lending Commitments

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements, including guarantees of third-party obligations. Guarantees are contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require us to make a guaranteed payment or perform an obligation to a third-party based on certain trigger events. At

December 31, 2019

, we had not recorded any contingent liabilities in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position related to any guarantees. See Note 9 -

Fair Value Measurements

to our consolidated financial statements for information on contingent consideration liabilities related to business acquisitions.

We extend credit, primarily arising from agreements with customers for unused lines of credit on our credit cards, in the ordinary course of business. Each unused credit card line is unconditionally cancellable by us. See Note 4.

Loan Receivables and Allowance for Loan Losses

Contractual Obligations

____________________________________________________________________________________________

In the normal course of business, we enter into various contractual obligations that require future cash payments. Our future cash payments associated with our contractual obligations at

December 31, 2019

are summarized below.

______________________

(1)

Savings accounts (including money market accounts), brokered network deposits sweeps, and non-interest-bearing deposits are assumed for purposes of this table to be due in 2020 because they may be withdrawn at any time without payment of any penalty.

(2)

Deposits do not include interest payments because the amount and timing of these payments cannot be reasonably estimated as certain deposits have early withdrawal rights and also the option to roll interest payments into the balance. The average interest rate on our interest-bearing deposits for the

year ended December 31, 2019

was

2.4%

. See Note 7.

Deposits

Amounts shown exclude interest on floating rate borrowings. See Note 8.

Borrowings

(4)

Purchase obligations at

December 31, 2019

reflect the minimum purchase obligation under legally binding contracts with contract terms that are both fixed and determinable. These amounts exclude obligations for goods and services that already have been incurred and are reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

(5)

The table above does not include estimated payments of liabilities associated with uncertain income tax positions.  The inherent complexity and uncertainty around the timing and amount of future outflows for uncertain tax positions do not permit a reasonably reliable estimate of payments, if any, to be made in connection with these liabilities. At

December 31, 2019

, we had unrecognized tax benefits of

$255 million

, excluding related interest and penalties.  See Note 14.

Critical Accounting Estimates

____________________________________________________________________________________________

In preparing our consolidated financial statements, we have identified certain accounting estimates and assumptions that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties. The critical accounting estimates we have identified relate to allowance for loan losses and fair value measurements. These estimates reflect our best judgment about current, and for some estimates future, economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements. If these conditions change from those expected, it is reasonably possible that these judgments and estimates could change, which may result in incremental losses on loan receivables, or material changes to our Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, among other effects. See Note 2.

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

to our consolidated financial statements, which discusses the significant accounting policies related to these estimates.

Allowance for Loan Losses

Losses on loan receivables are recognized when they are incurred, which requires us to make our best estimate of probable losses in the portfolio. The method for calculating the best estimate of probable losses takes into account our historical experience, adjusted for current conditions with each product and customer type, and our judgment concerning the probable effects of relevant observable data, trends and market factors.

We evaluate each portfolio quarterly. For credit card receivables, our estimation process includes analysis of historical data, and there is a significant amount of judgment applied in selecting inputs and analyzing the results produced by the models to determine the allowance. Our risk process includes standards and policies for reviewing major risk exposures and concentrations, and evaluates relevant data either for individual loans or on a portfolio basis, as appropriate. More specifically, we use a migration analysis to estimate the likelihood that a loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency. The migration analysis considers uncollectible principal, interest and fees reflected in the loan receivables. We use other analyses to estimate losses incurred on non-delinquent accounts. The considerations in these analyses include past performance, risk management techniques applied to various accounts, historical behavior of different account vintages, current economic conditions, recent trends in delinquencies, bankruptcy filings, account collection management, policy changes, account seasoning, loan volume and amounts, payment rates, forecasting uncertainties and a qualitative assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for losses, which compares this allowance for losses to projected net charge-offs over the next 12 months, in a manner consistent with regulatory guidance. We do not evaluate credit card loans for impairment on an individual basis, but instead estimate its allowance for credit card loan losses on a portfolio basis. Further, experience is not available for new portfolios; therefore, while we are developing that experience, we set loss allowances based on our experience with the most closely analogous products in our portfolio. The underlying assumptions, estimates and assessments we use to provide for losses are updated periodically to reflect our view of current conditions and are subject to the regulatory examination process, which can result in changes to our assumptions. Changes in such estimates can significantly affect the allowance and provision for losses. It is possible that we will experience credit losses that are different from our current estimates.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments which is effective for the Company on January 1, 2020. This ASU replaces the existing accounting standard for credit losses and will change the accounting model for how credit losses will be recognized in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 2.

Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies — New Accounting Standards,

to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the new accounting standard for credit losses and its expected impact to the Company’s allowance for loan losses.


Fair Value Measurements

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value every reporting period include investments in debt and equity securities as well as contingent consideration obligations. Assets that are not measured at fair value every reporting period, but that are subject to fair value measurements in certain circumstances, primarily include acquired loans, loans that have been reduced to fair value when they are held for sale, impaired loans that have been reduced based on the fair value of the underlying collateral, cost method and equity method investments that are written down to fair value when they are impaired.

Assets that are written down to fair value when impaired are not subsequently adjusted to fair value unless further impairment occurs. A fair value measurement is determined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information that is consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. The determination of fair value often involves significant judgments about assumptions such as determining an appropriate discount rate that factors in both risk and liquidity premiums, identifying the similarities and differences in market transactions, weighting those differences accordingly and then making the appropriate adjustments to those market transactions to reflect the risks specific to our asset being valued.
