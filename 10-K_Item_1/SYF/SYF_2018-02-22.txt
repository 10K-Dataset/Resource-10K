ITEM 1. BUSINESS

Our Company

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We are one of the premier consumer financial services companies in the United States. Our roots in consumer finance trace back to 1932, and today we are the largest provider of private label credit cards in the United States based on purchase volume and receivables. We provide a range of credit products through programs we have established with a diverse group of national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare service providers, which we refer to as our “partners.” Through our partners’ over380,000locations across the United States and Canada, and their websites and mobile applications, we offer their customers a variety of credit products to finance the purchase of goods and services. During2017, we financed$131.8 billionof purchase volume, and atDecember 31, 2017, we had$81.9 billionof loan receivables and74.5 millionactive accounts. Our active accounts represent a geographically diverse group of both consumers and businesses, with an average FICO score of715for active accounts atDecember 31, 2017.

Our business benefits from longstanding and collaborative relationships with our partners, including some of the nation’s leading retailers and manufacturers with well-known consumer brands, such as Lowe’s, Walmart, Amazon and Ashley Furniture HomeStore. We believe our partner-centric business model has been successful because it aligns our interests with those of our partners and provides substantial value to both our partners and our customers. Our partners promote our credit products because they generate increased sales and strengthen customer loyalty. Our customers benefit from instant access to credit, discounts and promotional offers. We seek to differentiate ourselves through deep partner integration and our extensive marketing expertise. We have omni-channel (in-store, online and mobile) technology and marketing capabilities, which allow us to offer and deliver our credit products instantly to customers across multiple channels.

We conduct our operations through a single business segment. Our revenue activities are managed through three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards, and small- and medium-sized business credit products. Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering primarily private label credit cards and installment loans. CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health and personal care procedures, products or services, such as dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology.

We offer our credit products primarily through our wholly-owned subsidiary, the Bank. Through the Bank, we offer, directly to retail and commercial customers, a range of deposit products insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), including certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”), money market accounts and savings accounts. We also take deposits at the Bank through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. At December 31, 2017, we had$56.5 billionin deposits, which represented73%of our total funding sources.

Ownership and Regulation of Synchrony

____________________________________________________________________________________________

In November 2015, Synchrony Financial became a stand-alone savings and loan holding company following the completion of GE's exchange offer, in which GE exchanged shares of GE common stock for all the remaining shares of our common stock it owned (the “Separation”). In June 2017, the Company also elected financial holding company status under the Bank Holding Company Act.

As a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, as a large provider of consumer financial services, the Company is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB.










The Bank is a federally chartered savings association and therefore is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the U.S. Treasury (the “OCC”), which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC.

For a discussion of the regulation of the Company and the Bank, see “—Regulation.”

Our Sales Platforms

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We offer our credit products through three sales platforms: Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit. Set forth below is a summary of certain information relating to our Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit platforms:

Retail Card

Retail Card is a leading provider of private label credit cards, and also provides Dual Cards, general purpose co-branded credit cards and small- and medium-sized business credit products. Retail Card accounted for$12.0 billion, or74%, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year endedDecember 31, 2017. Substantially all of the credit extended in this platform is on standard (i.e., non-promotional) terms.

Retail Card’s revenue consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables. Other income earned by the Retail Card sales platform primarily consists of interchange fees earned when our Dual Card or co-brand cards are used outside of our partners’ sales channels and fees paid to us by customers who purchase our debt cancellation products, less loyalty program payments.

Retail Card Partners

We have ongoing Retail Card programs with29national and regional retailers, which have approximately45,000retail locations and include department stores, specialty retailers, mass merchandisers, e-retailers (multi-channel and online retailers) and oil and gas retailers. The average length of our relationship with our ongoing Retail Card partners is20years.














PayPal transaction

In November 2017, we announced our agreement to acquire approximately $6.8 billion of loans from PayPal Credit U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, including approximately $1.0 billion of interests held by other investors and chartered financial institutions. Synchrony Bank will become PayPal’s exclusive issuing bank for the PayPal Credit point of sale financing program in the United States for the next 10 years. PayPal has also agreed to extend its existing co-brand credit card relationship with Synchrony Financial through the same 10-year term. Subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions, these transactions (collectively, the “PayPal transaction”) are expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.

New and Extended Partner Programs

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we extended our Retail Card program agreements with Belk, Evine, Men's Wearhouse and QVC, and launched our new programs with At Home, Cathay Pacific, Nissan and Infiniti and zulily.

Program agreements accounting for79%of Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2017, currently have an expiration date in 2020 or beyond. Set forth below is certain information regarding the current scheduled expiration dates of our ongoing29Retail Card partner programs:

(1)Percentages stated as a proportion of total Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2017.

(2)Existing partners as of December 31, 2017.

(3)Excludes certain credit card portfolios that were sold, have not been renewed, or expire in 2018, which represent less than 1% of our total Retail Card interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2017. Does not reflect the announced PayPal transaction which we expect to close in the third quarter of 2018.

Our five largest programs are with Retail Card partners: Gap, JCPenney, Lowe’s, Sam’s Club and Walmart. These programs accounted in aggregate for53%of our total interest and fees on loans for the year endedDecember 31, 2017, and49%of loan receivables atDecember 31, 2017. Our programs with JCPenney, Lowe's and Walmart each accounted for more than 10% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year endedDecember 31, 2017. Sam’s Club is a subsidiary of Walmart that is a separate contracting entity with its own program agreement with us, which we report separately from the Walmart program. For purposes of the information provided in this paragraph with respect to Walmart, the interest and fees on loans from the Sam's Club program have not been included.

The length of our relationship with each of these five Retail Card partners is over18years, and in the case of Lowe's, 38 years. The current expiration dates for these agreements range from 2019 through 2023.

In addition to the above, we expect to close the PayPal transaction in the third quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory approval and other customary conditions. Following completion of this transaction we expect our combined credit and co-brand programs with PayPal to become one of our five largest partner programs.

Retail Card Program Agreements



Our Retail Card programs are governed by program agreements that are each negotiated separately with our partners. Although the terms of the agreements are partner-specific, and may be amended from time to time, under a typical program agreement, our partner agrees to support and promote the program to its customers, but we control credit criteria and issue credit cards to customers who qualify under those criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Other key provisions in the Retail Card program agreements include:

Term

Retail Card program agreements typically have contract terms ranging from approximately five to ten years. Many program agreements have renewal clauses that provide for automatic renewal for one or more years until terminated by us or our partner. We typically seek to renew the program agreements well in advance of their termination dates.










Exclusivity

The program agreements typically are exclusive for the products we offer and limit our partners’ ability to originate or promote other private label or co-branded credit cards during the term of the agreement.

Retailer share arrangements

Most of our Retail Card program agreements contain retailer share arrangements that provide for payments to our partner if the economic performance of the program exceeds a contractually-defined threshold. Economic performance for the purposes of these arrangements is typically measured based on agreed upon program revenues (including interest income and certain other income) less agreed upon program expenses (including interest expense, provision for loan losses, retailer payments and operating expenses). We may also provide other economic benefits to our partners such as royalties on purchase volume or payments for new accounts, in some cases instead of retailer share arrangements (for example, on our co-branded credit cards). All of these arrangements align our interests and provide an additional incentive to our partners to promote our credit products.

Other economic terms

In addition to the retailer share arrangements, the program agreements typically provide that the parties will develop a marketing plan to support the program, and they set the terms by which a joint marketing budget is funded, the basic terms of the rewards program linked to the use of our product (such as opportunities to receive double rewards points for purchases made on a Retail Card product), and the allocation of costs related to the rewards program.

Termination

The program agreements set forth the circumstances in which a party may terminate the agreement prior to expiration. Our program agreements generally permit us and our partner to terminate the agreement prior to its scheduled termination date for various reasons, including if the other party materially breaches its obligations. Some program agreements also permit our partner to terminate the program if we fail to meet certain service levels or change certain key cardholder terms or our credit criteria, we fail to achieve certain approval rate targets with respect to approvals of new customers, we elect not to increase the program size when the outstanding loan receivables under the program reach certain thresholds, we are not adequately capitalized, certain force majeure events occur or certain changes in our ownership occur. Certain program agreements are also subject to early termination by a party if the other party has a material adverse change in its financial condition. Historically, these rights have not typically been triggered or exercised. Some of our program agreements provide that, upon termination or expiration, our partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the accounts and loan receivables generated with respect to its program at fair market value or a stated price, including all related customer data.

Payment Solutions

Payment Solutions is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, offering private label credit cards and installment loans. Payment Solutions accounted for$2.2 billion, or14%, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year endedDecember 31, 2017. Substantially all of the credit extended in Payment Solutions is promotional financing.

Payment Solutions’ revenue primarily consists of interest and fees on our loan receivables, including “merchant discounts,” which are fees paid to us by our partners in almost all cases to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. The types of promotional financing we offer include: deferred interest (interest accrues during a promotional period and becomes payable if the full purchase amount is not paid off during the promotional period), no interest (no interest on a promotional purchase) and reduced interest (interest is assessed monthly at a promotional interest rate during the promotional period). As a result, during the promotional period we do not generate interest income or generate it at a lower rate, although we continue to generate fee income relating to late fees on required minimum payments.










Payment Solutions Partners

In Payment Solutions, we create customized credit programs for national and regional retailers, local merchants, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and our own individually-branded industry programs, which are available to local merchants, participating merchants, dealers and retail outlets to provide financing offers to their customers.

AtDecember 31, 2017, our Payment Solutions partners had approximately125,000retail locations. Payment Solutions is diversified by program, with no one Payment Solutions program accounting for more than 1.2% of our total interest and fees on loans for the year endedDecember 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017, the average length of our relationships with our ten largest Payment Solutions programs was 12 years.

(1)Based on interest and fees on loans for the year ended December 31, 2017.

(2)Length of relationship based on MEGA Group USA, which subsequently merged with Nationwide Buying Group to form Nationwide Marketing Group.

In Payment Solutions, we generally partner with sellers of “big-ticket” products or services (generally priced from $500 to $25,000) to consumers where our financing products provide strong incremental value to our partners and their customers. We also promote all of our programs to sellers through direct marketing activities such as industry trade publications, trade shows and sales efforts by dedicated internal and external sales teams, leveraging our existing partner network or through endorsements from manufacturers, buying groups and industry associations. Our broad array of point of sale technologies and quick enrollment process allow us to quickly and cost-effectively integrate new partners.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, we launched our Synchrony Car Care program and our new Synchrony HOME credit card network, and extended our program agreements with BrandsMart U.S.A.; City Furniture; Home Furnishings Association; Husqvarna Viking; MEGA Group USA, subsequently merged with Nationwide Buying Group to form Nationwide Marketing Group; Midas; Nautilus; Sweetwater and Yamaha.














Payment Solutions Program Agreements

National and Regional Retailers and Manufacturers

We control credit criteria and issue credit cards or provide installment loans to customers who qualify under those credit criteria. We own the underlying accounts and all loan receivables generated under the program from the time of origination. Our Payment Solutions program agreements set forth the program’s economic terms, including the merchant discount applicable to each promotional finance offering. We typically do not pay fees to our Payment Solutions partners pursuant to any retailer share arrangements, but in some cases we pay a sign-up fee to a partner or provide volume-based rebates on the merchant discount paid by the partner.

Buying Groups and Industry Associations

The programs we have established with buying groups and industry associations, such as the Home Furnishings Association, Jewelers of America and Nationwide Marketing Group, are governed by program agreements under which we make our credit products available to their respective members or dealers, but these agreements generally do not require the members or dealers to offer our products to their customers. Under the terms of the program agreements, buying groups and industry associations generally agree to support and promote the respective programs. These arrangements may include sign-up fees and volume-based incentives paid by us to the groups and their members.

Individually-Branded Programs

Our individually-branded programs are focused on specific industries, where we create either company-branded or company and partner-branded private label credit cards that are usable across all participating locations within the industry-specific network. For example, our Synchrony Car Care program, comprised of merchants selling automotive parts, repair services and tires, covers over30,000locations across the United States, and cards issued may be dual branded with Synchrony Car Care and partners such as Midas, Michelin Tires or Pep Boys. Under the terms of these programs, we establish merchant discounts applicable to each financing offer, and, in some cases, the fees we charge partners for their membership in the network. In addition, the Synchrony Car Care program allows for expanded use outside of the program network at certain related merchants, such as gas stations. Similarly, we launched the Synchrony HOME credit card network, accepted by retailers at more than10,000locations in industries such as home furnishing, flooring and electronics.

Dealer Agreements

For the programs we have established with manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and individually-branded programs described above, we enter into individual agreements with the merchants and dealers that offer our credit products under these programs. These agreements generally are not exclusive and some parties who offer our financing products also offer financing from our competitors. Our agreements generally continue until terminated by either party, with termination typically available to either party at will upon 15 days’ written notice. Our dealer agreements set forth the economic terms associated with the program, including the fees charged to dealers to offer promotional financing, and in some cases, allow us to periodically change the fees we charge.










CareCredit

CareCredit is a leading provider of promotional financing to consumers for health and personal care procedures, products or services. CareCredit accounted for$2.0 billion, or12%, of our total interest and fees on loans for the year endedDecember 31, 2017. Substantially all of the credit extended in CareCredit is promotional financing.

We offer customers a CareCredit-branded private label credit card that may be used across our network of CareCredit providers. In October 2017, we also announced the launch of our CareCredit Dual Card offering. We generate revenue in CareCredit primarily from interest and fees on our loan receivables and from merchant discounts paid by providers to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing.

CareCredit Partners

The vast majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers, which includes networks of healthcare practitioners that provide elective and other procedures that generally are not fully covered by insurance. The remainder are primarily national and regional healthcare providers and health-focused retailers, including Rite Aid.



During2017, over195,000locations either processed a CareCredit application or made a sale on a CareCredit credit card. No one CareCredit partner accounted for more than0.3%of our total interest and fees on loans for the year endedDecember 31, 2017.

We enter into provider agreements with individual healthcare providers who become part of our CareCredit network. These provider agreements are similar to the dealer agreements that govern our relationships with the merchants and dealers offering our Payment Solutions products in that the agreements are not exclusive and typically may be terminated at will upon 15 days’ notice. Multi-year agreements are in place for larger multi-location relationships across all markets. There are typically no retailer share arrangements with partners in CareCredit.

AtDecember 31, 2017, we had relationships with over110professional and other associations (including the American Dental Association and the American Animal Hospital Association), manufacturers and buying groups, which endorse and promote our credit products to their members. Of these relationships, over65were paid endorsements linked to member enrollment in, and volume under, the relevant program.










We screen potential partners using a variety of criteria, including whether the potential provider specializes in one of our approved specialties, carries the appropriate licensing and certifications, and meets our underwriting criteria. We also screen potential partners for reputational issues. We work with professional and other associations, manufacturers, buying groups, industry associations and healthcare consultants to educate their constituents about the products and services we offer. We believe our ability to attract new partners is aided by our customer satisfaction rate, which our research in2017showed is89%. We also approach individual healthcare service providers through direct mail, advertising, and at trade shows.

During the year endedDecember 31, 2017, we acquired the Citi Health Card portfolio and renewed Bosley, Mars Petcare, National Veterinary Associates and Sono Bello in our network of providers. The network expanded by over10,000provider locations and grew average active cardholder accounts by9%.



Our Customers

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Acquiring and Marketing to Retail Card & Payment Solutions Customers

We work directly with our partners using their distribution network, communication channels and customer interactions to market our products to their customers and potential customers. We believe our presence at our partners’ points of sale (in-store, online and mobile) and our ability to make credit decisions instantly for a customer that is already predisposed to make a purchase enables us to acquire new customer accounts at a lower cost than general purpose card issuers.

To acquire new customers, we collaborate with our partners and leverage our marketing expertise to create marketing programs that promote our products to creditworthy customers. Frequently, our partners market the availability of credit as part of (and with little incremental cost to) the advertising for their goods and services. Our marketing programs include marketing offers (e.g., 10% off the customer’s first purchase) and consumer communications that are delivered through a variety of channels, including in-store signage, online advertising, retailer website placement, associate communication, emails, text messages, direct mail campaigns, advertising circulars, and outside marketing via television, radio, print, along with digital marketing (search engine optimization and paid search). We also employ our proprietary Quickscreen acquisition method to make targeted pre-approved credit offers at the point-of-sale. Our Quickscreen technology allows us to run customer information that we have obtained from our partners through our risk models in advance so that when these customers seek to make payment for goods and services at our partners' points-of-sale, we can make a credit offer instantly, if appropriate. Based on our experience, due to the personalized and immediate nature of the offer, Quickscreen significantly outperforms traditional direct-to-consumer pre-approved channels, such as direct mail or email, in response rate and dollar spending.

Acquiring and Marketing to CareCredit Customers

We market our products through our provider network by training our network providers on the advantages of CareCredit products and by making marketing materials available for providers to use to promote the program and educate customers. Our training helps our providers learn to discuss payment options during the pre-treatment consultation phase, including the option to apply for a CareCredit credit card and the offer of promotional credit. According to a 2017 survey of our CareCredit customers,51%indicated that they would have postponed or reduced the scope of treatment if financing was not offered by their provider. Consumers can apply for our CareCredit products in the provider’s office or online via the web or mobile device.

We also market our products to potential and existing customers directly through our web-based provider locator, which allows customers to search for healthcare service providers that accept the CareCredit credit card by desired geography and provider type. According to our records, our CareCredit provider locator averaged over975,000searches per month during the year endedDecember 31, 2017. We believe our partners recognize the locator as an important source of new customer acquisition.










Enterprise Customer Engagement ("ECE") / Analytics

After a customer obtains one of our products, our marketing programs encourage ongoing card usage by communicating the benefits of our products’ value propositions. Examples of such programs include: promotional financing offers, cardholder events, product discounts, dollar-off certificates, account holder sales, reward points and offers, new product announcements and previews, and free or reduced cost gift wrapping, alteration or delivery services. These programs are executed through our partners’ and our own (direct to consumer) distribution channels.

Through our ECE and data analytics teams, we optimize these programs through detailed test-and-learn tracking of cardholder responsiveness and subsequent behavior. This data is leveraged by applying machine learning and other analytic techniques to create tools that allow for customized marketing messages and promotional offers to cardholders. For example, if a cardholder consistently responds to a coupon sent by text message versus other channels, we will tailor future marketing messages to be delivered by text message and use such insight to identify other populations that are likely to behave in similar ways. Our Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card programs are further enhanced by the collection and analysis of data on customers' spend patterns at both our partners and at other retailers. The objective of these efforts is to drive incremental volume for our programs while maximizing return on investment.

Our extensive marketing activities targeted to existing customers have yielded high levels of re-use across both our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms. During the year endedDecember 31, 2017,27%and53%of purchase volume across our Payment Solutions platform and CareCredit network, respectively, resulted from repeat use at one or more retailers or providers.

Digital and mobile capabilities

We continued our focus and investment on enhancing our digital and data analytics capabilities. Our investments have spanned extensive customer research and enhancements to digital design and user experience to enhance existing processes and launch new digital platforms to reach our customers in unique ways.

We enhanced our fully-responsive dApply application with features such as data pre-fill and instant provisioning of new accounts to retailer digital wallets to make the application process quick and secure. In addition, our Digital Buy product is an easy to install checkout button that transforms the purchasing process into a fully partner-branded experience. This gives customers a quick and easy way to pay on a retailer’s website with their private label credit card, including promotional purchases, as well as lookup their account and request a credit line increase, all within the partner checkout experience. Additionally we continue to invest in our digital wallet capabilities including Apple Pay and Android Pay, as well as developing our own wallet capabilities within our CareCredit platform to allow customers to transact with our partners in a variety of ways.

We acquired GPShopper, an innovative developer of mobile applications that offers retailers and brands a full suite of commerce, engagement and analytic tools, through which we expanded our SyPI application capabilities and saw significant adoption and growth in 2017. Our SyPI application is a fully integrated Synchrony plug-in credit feature for our retailers’ apps, which allows credit card holders to easily shop, redeem rewards, and securely manage and make payments on their accounts via their mobile device. For our web users, we introduced Pay Without Login, which enables customers to access their account through device authentication versus a password and make one-time payments online. We also introduced our MySynchrony iOS and Android apps to make it easier for our cardholders to access their accounts on their mobile devices.












Loyalty Programs

The retail loyalty programs we manage typically provide cardholders with statement credit or cash back rewards. Other programs include rewards points, which are redeemable for a variety of products or awards, or merchandise discounts that are earned by achieving a pre-set spending level on their private label credit card, Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card. The merchandise discounts can be mailed to the cardholder, accessed digitally or may be immediately redeemable at the partner’s store. These loyalty programs are designed to generate incremental purchase volume per customer, while reinforcing the value of the card to the customer and strengthening customer loyalty. We continue to provide loyalty programs to customers that utilize non-credit payment types such as cash, debit or check. These multi-tender loyalty programs will allow our partners to market to an expanded customer base and allow us access to additional prospective cardholders.

Commercial Customers

In addition to our efforts to acquire consumer cardholders, we are increasing our focus on small to mid-sized commercial customers. We offer these customers private label credit cards and Dual Cards that can be used primarily at our Retail Card partners and are similar to our consumer offerings. We are also increasing our focus on marketing our commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product that supports a wide range of business customers.

Our Credit Products

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Through our platforms, we offer three principal types of credit products: credit cards, commercial credit products and consumer installment loans. We also offer a debt cancellation product.

The following table sets forth each credit product by type and indicates the percentage of our total loan receivables that are under standard terms only or pursuant to a promotional financing offer atDecember 31, 2017.

Credit Cards

Our credit card products are loans we extend through open-ended revolving credit card accounts. We offer the following principal types of credit cards:

Private Label Credit Cards

Private label credit cards are partner-branded credit cards (e.g., Lowe’s or Amazon) or program-branded credit cards (e.g., Synchrony Car Care or CareCredit) that are used primarily for the purchase of goods and services from the partner or within the program network. In addition, in some cases, cardholders may be permitted to access their credit card accounts for cash advances.










Credit under a private label credit card typically is extended either on standard terms only in our Retail Card sales platform, which means accounts are assessed periodic interest charges using an agreed non-promotional fixed and/or variable interest rate, or pursuant to a promotional financing offer in our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms, involving deferred interest, no interest or reduced interest during a set promotional period. Promotional periods typically range between six and 48 months, but we may agree to longer terms with the partner. In almost all cases, we receive a merchant discount from our partners to compensate us for all or part of the foregone interest income associated with promotional financing. The terms of these promotions vary by partner, but generally the longer the deferred interest, reduced interest or interest-free period, the greater the partner’s merchant discount. Some offers permit customers to pay for a purchase in equal monthly payments with no interest or at a reduced interest rate, rather than deferring or delaying interest charges. For our deferred interest products, approximately75%to80%of customer transactions are typically paid off before interest is assessed. In CareCredit, standard rate financing generally applies to charges under $200.

We typically do not charge interchange or other fees to our partners when a customer uses a private label credit card to purchase our partners’ goods and services through our payment system.

Most of our private label credit card business is in the United States. For some of our partners who have locations in Canada, we also support the issuance and acceptance of private label credit cards at their locations in Canada and from customers in Canada.

Dual Cardsand General Purpose Co-Brand Cards

Our patented Dual Cards are credit cards that function as private label credit cards when used to make purchases of goods or services from our partners, and as general purpose credit cards when used to make purchases from other retailers wherever cards from those card networks are accepted or for cash advance transactions. We currently issue Dual Cards for use on the MasterCard and Visa networks and we currently have the ability to issue Dual Cards for use on the American Express and Discover networks.

We have been granted two U.S. patents relating to the process by which our Dual Cards function as a private label credit card when used to make purchases from our partners and function as a general purpose credit card when used on the systems of other credit card associations.

We also offer general purpose co-branded credit cards that do not function as private label credit cards.

Credit extended under our Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards typically is extended on standard terms only. Dual Cards and general purpose co-branded credit cards are primarily offered through our Retail Card platform. AtDecember 31, 2017, we offered Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit cards through21of our29ongoing Retail Card programs, of which the majority are Dual Cards. We expect to continue to increase the number of partner programs that offer Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards and seek to increase the portion of our loan receivables attributable to these products.

Charges using a Dual Card or general purpose co-branded credit card generate interchange income for us in connection with purchases made by cardholders other than in-store or online from that partner.

We currently do not issue Dual Cards or general purpose co-branded credit cards in Canada.

Terms and Conditions

As a general matter, the financial terms and conditions governing our credit card products vary by program and product type and change over time, although we seek to standardize the non-financial provisions consistently across all products. The terms and conditions of our credit card products are governed by a cardholder agreement and applicable laws and regulations.

We assign each card account a credit limit when the account is initially opened. Thereafter, we may increase or decrease individual credit limits from time to time, at our discretion, based primarily on our evaluation of the customer’s creditworthiness and ability to pay.










For the vast majority of accounts, periodic interest charges are calculated using the daily balance method, which results in daily compounding of periodic interest charges, subject to, at times, a grace period on new purchases. Cash advances are not subject to a grace period, and some credit card programs do not provide a grace period for promotional purchases. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on credit card accounts, including, as applicable and provided in the cardholder agreement, cash advance transaction fees and late fees where a customer has not paid at least the minimum payment due by the required due date.

Typically, each customer with an outstanding debit balance on his or her credit card account must make a minimum payment each month. A customer may pay the total amount due at any time without penalty. We also may enter into arrangements with delinquent customers to extend or otherwise change payment schedules and to waive interest charges and/or fees.

Commercial Credit Products

We offer private label cards and Dual Cards for commercial customers that are similar to our consumer offerings. We also offer a commercial pay-in-full accounts receivable product to a wide range of business customers. We offer commercial credit products primarily through our Retail Card platform to the commercial customers of our Retail Card partners.

Installment Loans

In Payment Solutions, we originate installment loans to consumers (and a limited number of commercial customers) in the United States, primarily in the power products market. Installment loans are closed-end credit accounts where the customer pays down the outstanding balance in installments. The terms of our installment loans are governed by customer agreements and applicable laws and regulations.

Installment loans are assessed periodic interest charges using fixed interest rates. In addition to periodic interest charges, we may impose other charges and fees on loan accounts, including late fees where a customer has not made the required payment by the required due date and returned payment fees.

Debt Cancellation Products

We offer a debt cancellation product to our credit card customers via online, mobile and, on a limited basis, direct mail. Customers who choose to purchase this product are charged a monthly fee based on their ending balance on each billing statement. In return, the Bank will cancel all or a portion of a customer’s credit card balance in the event of certain qualifying life events.

Direct Banking

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Through the Bank, we offer our customers a range of FDIC-insured deposit products. The Bank also takes deposits through third-party securities brokerage firms that offer our FDIC-insured deposit products to their customers. AtDecember 31, 2017, we had$56.5 billionin deposits,$42.7 billionof which were direct deposits and$13.8 billionof which were brokered deposits. During 2017, direct deposits were received from approximately360,000customers that had a total of approximately680,000accounts. Retail customers accounted for substantially all of our direct deposits atDecember 31, 2017. The Bank had an87%retention rate on certificates of deposit balances up for renewal for the year endedDecember 31, 2017. FDIC insurance is provided for our deposit products up to applicable limits.

We have significantly expanded our online direct banking operations in recent years and our deposit base serves as a source of stable and diversified low cost funding for our credit activities. Our online platform is highly scalable allowing us to expand without having to rely on a traditional “brick and mortar” branch network. We expect the continued growth in our direct banking platform to come primarily from retail deposits.










We continue to grow our direct banking operations and believe we are well-positioned to continue to benefit from the consumer-driven shift from branch banking to direct banking. According to the 2017 American Bankers Association survey, approximately72%of customers primarily use direct channels (internet, mail, phone and mobile) to manage their bank accounts.

Our deposit products include certificates of deposit, IRAs, money market accounts and savings accounts. We market our deposit products through multiple channels including digital and print. Customers can apply for, fund, and service their deposit accounts online or via phone. We have dedicated banking representatives within our call centers to service deposit accounts. Fiserv, Inc. ("Fiserv") provides the core banking platform for our online retail deposits including a customer-facing account opening and servicing platform.

To attract new deposits and retain existing ones, we intend to introduce new deposit products and enhancements to our existing products. These new and enhanced products may include the introduction of checking accounts, overdraft protection lines of credit, a bill payment and person-to-person payment features, and Synchrony-branded debit cards. Our focus on deposit-taking and related branding efforts will also enable us to offer other branded direct-banking products more efficiently in the future.

We seek to differentiate our deposit product offerings from our competitors on the basis of brand, reputation, convenience, customer service and value. Our deposit products emphasize reliability, trust, security, convenience and attractive rates. Weoffer rewards to customers based on their tenure or balance amounts, including reduced fees, travel offers and concierge telephone support.

Credit Risk Management

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Credit risk management is a critical component of our management and growth strategy. Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising from customer default when customers are unable or unwilling to meet their financial obligations to us. Our credit risk arising from credit products is generally highly diversified across approximately130 millionopen accounts atDecember 31, 2017, without significant individual exposures. We manage credit risk primarily according to customer segments and product types.

Customer Account Acquisition

We have developed programs to promote credit with each of our partners and have developed varying credit decision guidelines for the different partners. We originate credit accounts through several different channels, including in-store, mail, internet, mobile, telephone and pre-approved solicitations. In addition, we have, and may in the future acquire, accounts that were originated by third parties in connection with establishing programs with new partners.

Regardless of the channel, in making the initial credit approval decision to open a credit card or other account or otherwise grant credit, we follow a series of credit risk and underwriting procedures. In most cases, when applications are made in-store or by internet or mobile, the process is fully automated and applicants are notified of our credit decision immediately. We generally obtain certain information provided by the applicant and obtain a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus. The credit report information we obtain is electronically transmitted into industry scoring models and our proprietary scoring models developed to calculate a credit score. The risk management team determines in advance the qualifying credit scores and initial credit line assignments for each portfolio and product type. We periodically analyze performance trends of accounts originated at different score levels as compared to projected performance, and adjust the minimum score or the opening credit limit to manage risk. Different scoring models may be used depending upon bureau type and account source.

We also apply additional application screens based on various inputs, including credit bureau information, to help identify potential fraud and prior bankruptcies before qualifying the application for approval. We compare applicants’ names against the Specially Designated Nationals list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“OFAC”), as well as screens that account for adherence to USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”) and Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (the “CARD Act”) requirements, including ability to pay requirements.










We also use pre-approved account solicitations for certain programs. Potential applicants are pre-screened using information provided by our partner or obtained from outside lists, and qualified individuals receive a pre-approved credit offer by mail or email.

Acquired Portfolio Evaluation

Our risk management team evaluates each portfolio that we acquire in connection with establishing programs with new partners to ensure the portfolio satisfies our credit risk guidelines. As part of this review, we receive data on the third-party accounts and loans, which allows us to assess the portfolio on the basis of certain core characteristics, such as historical performance of the assets and distributions of credit and loss information. In addition, we benchmark potential portfolio acquisitions against our existing programs to assess relative current and projected risks. Finally, our risk management team must approve the acquisition, taking into account the results of our risk assessment process. Once assets are migrated to our systems, our account management protocols will apply immediately as described below under “—Customer Account Management,” “—Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions” and “—Collections.”

Customer Account Management

We regularly assess the credit risk exposure of our customer accounts. This ongoing assessment includes information relating to the customer’s performance with respect to its account with us, as well as information from credit bureaus relating to the customer’s broader credit performance. To monitor and control the quality of our loan portfolio (including the portion of the portfolio originated by third parties), we use behavioral scoring models that we have developed to score each active account on its monthly cycle date. Proprietary risk models, together with the FICO scores obtained on each active account no less than quarterly, are an integral part of our credit decision-making process. Depending on the duration of the customer’s account, risk profile and other performance metrics, the account may be subject to a range of account actions, including limits on transaction authorization and increases or decreases in purchase and cash credit limits.

Credit Authorizations of Individual Transactions

Once an account has been opened, when a credit card is used to make a purchase in-store at one of our partners’ locations or online, point-of-sale terminals or online sites have an online connection with our credit authorization system, which allows for real-time updating of accounts. Each potential sales transaction is passed through a transaction authorization system, which takes into account a variety of behavior and risk factors to determine whether the transaction should be approved or declined, and whether a credit limit adjustment is warranted.

Fraud Investigation

We provide follow up and research with respect to different types of fraud such as fraud rings, new account fraud and transactional fraud. We have developed a proprietary fraud model to identify new account fraud and deployed tools that help identify transaction purchase behavior outside a customer’s established pattern. Our proprietary model is also complemented by externally sourced models and tools used across the industry to better identify fraud and protect our customers. We also are continuously implementing new and improved technologies to detect and prevent fraud such as utilizing embedded security chips ("EMV") for our active Dual Card and general purpose co-branded credit card products with all of our retail partners.

Collections

All monthly billing statements of accounts with past due amounts include a request for payment of these amounts. Collections personnel generally initiate contact with customers within 30 days after any portion of their balance becomes past due. The nature and the timing of the initial contact, typically a personal call, e-mail, text message or letter, are determined by a review of the customer’s prior account activity and payment habits.










We re-evaluate our collection efforts and consider the implementation of other techniques, including internal collection activities, use of external vendors and the sale of debt to third-party buyers, as a customer becomes increasingly delinquent. We limit our exposure to delinquencies through controls within the transaction authorization processes, the imposition of credit limits and criteria-based account suspension and revocation processes. In certain situations, we may enter into arrangements to extend or otherwise change payment schedules, decrease interest rates and/or waive fees to aid customers experiencing financial difficulties in their efforts to become current on their obligations to us.

Customer Service

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Customer service is an important feature of our relationship with our partners. Our customers can contact us via phone, mail, email, eService and eChat. During the year endedDecember 31, 2017, we handled approximately285 millioncalls.

We assign a dedicated toll-free customer service phone number to each of our Retail Card programs. Our Payment Solutions customers access customer service through one general purpose toll-free customer service phone number (except for a few large Payment Solutions programs, which have dedicated toll-free numbers). Our CareCredit platform has its own, dedicated toll-free customer service phone number. We also have dedicated toll-free customer service phone numbers for our deposit business.

We service all programs through our ten domestic and five off-shore call centers. We also provide phone-based customer service through a third-party vendor. We blend domestic and off-shore locations as an important part of our servicing strategy, to maintain service availability beyond normal work hours in the United States and to seek optimal costs. Customer service for cards issued to customers in Canada is supported through agents based in the United States.

Given the nature of our business and the high volume of calls, we maintain several centers of excellence to ensure the quality of our customer service across all of our sites. These centers of excellence consist of quality assurance, customer experience, training, workforce and capacity planning, surveillance and process control, tactical operations center, business solutions and technology support.

Production Services

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our production services organization oversees a number of services, including:

•payment processing (more than645 millionpaper and electronic payments in2017);

•embossing and mailing credit cards (more than85 millioncards in2017);

•printing and mailing and eService delivery of credit card statements (more than755 millionpaper and electronic statements in2017); and

•other letters mailed or sent electronically (more than90 millionin2017).

All U.S. customer payments received by mail are processed at one of two centers located in Atlanta, Georgia and Longwood, Florida, both of which are operated by the Bank. U.S. credit card statement printing and mailing, card embossing and mailing and letter production and mailing for customers are provided through outsourced services with First Data Corporation (“First Data”). While these services are outsourced, we monitor and maintain oversight of these other services. First Data also produces our statements and other mailings for deposit customers.

Card production embossing, mailing, statement printing and mailing services related to cards issued to customers in Canada are outsourced to Canadian suppliers.










Technology and Data Security

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Products and Services

We leverage information technology and deliver products and services that meet the needs of our partners and enable us to operate our business efficiently. The integration of our technology with our partners is at the core of our value proposition, enabling, among other things, customers to “apply and buy” at the point of sale, and many of our partners to settle transactions directly with us without an interchange fee. A key part of our strategic focus is the continued development of innovative, efficient, flexible technology and operational platforms to support marketing, risk management, account acquisition and account management, customer service, and new product development. We believe that the continued investment in and development of these platforms is an important part of our efforts to increase our competitive capabilities, reduce costs, improve quality and provide faster, more flexible technology services. Therefore, we continuously review capabilities and develop or acquire systems, processes and competencies to meet our business needs.

As part of our continuous efforts to enhance our technologies, we may either develop these capabilities internally or in partnership with third-party providers. We rely on third-party providers to help us deliver systems and operational infrastructure based on strategies and, in some cases, architecture, designed by us. These relationships include: First Data for our credit card transaction processing and production and Fiserv for retail banking.

Data Security

The protection and security of financial and personal information of our consumers is one of our highest priorities. We have implemented a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative, technical and physical safeguards and provides an appropriate level of protection to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our Company's and our customers' information. This includes protecting against any known or evolving threats to the security or integrity of customer records and information, and against unauthorized access to or use of customer records or information.

Our information security program is intelligence-led, focused on continuously adapting to an evolving landscape of emerging threats and available technology. Through data gathering and evaluation of emerging threats from internal and external incidents and technology investment, security controls are adjusted on a continuous basis. We work directly with our partners on an ongoing basis to expand our intelligence ecosystem and facilitate awareness and communications of events outside of the Company.

We have developed a security strategy and implemented multiple layers of controls embedded throughout our technology environment that establish multiple control points between threats and our assets. Our security program is designed to provide oversight of third parties who store, process or have access to sensitive data, and we require the same level of protection from such third-party service providers. We evaluate the effectiveness of the key security controls through ongoing assessment and measurement.

In addition, we identify risks that may threaten customer information and perform a variety of vulnerability and penetration testing on the platforms, systems and applications used to provide our products and services. We employ backup and disaster recovery procedures for all the systems that are used for storing, processing and transferring customer information, and we periodically test and validate our disaster recovery plans. We are compliant with the Payment Card Industry (PCI) program.










Competition

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Our industry is highly competitive and is becoming more competitive. We compete for relationships with partners in connection with retaining existing or establishing new consumer credit programs. Our primary competitors for partners include major financial institutions such as Alliance Data Systems, American Express, Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank, TD Bank and Wells Fargo, and to a lesser extent, potential partners’ own in-house financing capabilities. We compete for partners on the basis of a number of factors, including program financial and other terms, underwriting standards, marketing expertise, service levels, product and service offerings (including incentive and loyalty programs), technological capabilities and integration, brand and reputation. In addition, some of our competitors for partners have a business model that allows for their partners to manage underwriting (e.g., new account approval), customer service and collections, and other core banking responsibilities that we retain.

In our retail deposits business, we have acquisition and servicing capabilities similar to other direct-banking competitors. We compete for deposits with traditional banks, and in seeking to grow our direct-banking business, we compete with other banks that have direct-banking models similar to ours, such as Ally Financial, American Express, Capital One 360 (ING), Discover, Goldman Sachs, Nationwide, Sallie Mae and United Services Automobile Association (“USAA"). Competition among direct banks is intense because online banking provides customers the ability to quickly and easily deposit and withdraw funds and open and close accounts in favor of products and services offered by competitors.

Intellectual Property

____________________________________________________________________________________________

We use a variety of methods, such as trademarks, patents, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our intellectual property, including our brand, "Synchrony." We also place appropriate restrictions on our proprietary information to control access and prevent unauthorized disclosures. Our brands are important assets, and we take steps to protect the value of these assets and our reputation.










Employees

____________________________________________________________________________________________

AtDecember 31, 2017, we had over16,000full time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any material employment-related work stoppages and consider relations with our employees to be good. We also have relationships with third-party call center providers in the United States and other countries that provide us with additional contractors for customer service, collections and other functions.

Risk Management

____________________________________________________________________________________________

Strong risk management is at the core of our business strategy and we have developed processes to manage the major categories of risk, namely credit, market, liquidity, operational (including compliance) and strategic risk.

As described in greater detail below under “—Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities,” we manage enterprise risk using an integrated framework that includes board-level oversight, administration by a group of cross-functional management committees, and day-to-day implementation by a dedicated risk management team led by the Chief Risk Officer (“CRO”). We also utilize the "Three Lines of Defense" risk management model to demonstrate and structure the roles, responsibilities and accountabilities in the organization for taking and managing risk. The Risk Committee of the Board of Directors has responsibility for the oversight of the risk management program, and three other board committees have other oversight roles with respect to risk management. Several management committees and subcommittees have important roles and responsibilities in administering the risk management program, including the Enterprise Risk Management Committee (the “ERMC”), the Management Committee (the “MC”), the Asset and Liability Management Committee (the “ALCO”) and the Capital Management Committee (the "CMC"). This committee-focused governance structure provides a forum through which risk expertise is applied cross-functionally to all major decisions, including development of policies, processes and controls used by the CRO and risk management team to execute the risk management philosophy.

The enterprise risk management philosophy is to ensure that all relevant risks are appropriately identified, measured, monitored and controlled. The approach in executing this philosophy focuses on leveraging risk expertise to drive enterprise risk management using a strong governance framework structure, a comprehensive enterprise risk assessment program and an effective risk appetite framework.

Risk Categories

Risk management is organized around five major risk categories: credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk, operational risk (including compliance), and strategic risk. We evaluate the potential impact of a risk event on us (including subsidiaries) by assessing the partner and customer, financial, reputational, and legal and regulatory impacts.

Credit Risk

Credit risk is the risk of loss that arises when an obligor fails to meet the terms of an obligation. Credit risk includes exposure to consumer credit risk from customer loans as well as institutional credit risk, principally from our partners. Consumer credit risk is one of our most significant risks. See “—Credit Risk Management” for a description of the customer credit risk management procedures.










Market Risk

Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices, rates, indices, correlations or other market factors will result in losses for a position or portfolio. The principal market risk exposures arise from volatility in interest rates and their impact on economic value, capitalization levels and earnings. Market risk is managed by the ALCO, and is subject to policy and risk appetite limits on sensitivity of both earnings at risk and the economic value of equity. Market risk metrics are reviewed by ALCO monthly, the Risk Committee on a quarterly basis and the Board of Directors as required.

Liquidity Risk

Liquidity risk is the risk that an institution’s financial condition or overall safety and soundness are adversely affected by a real or perceived inability to meet contractual obligations and support planned growth. The primary liquidity objective is to maintain a liquidity profile that will enable us, even in times of stress or market disruption, to fund our existing assets and meet liabilities in a timely manner and at an acceptable cost. Policy and risk appetite limits require us and the Bank (and other entities within our business, as applicable) to ensure that sufficient liquid assets are available to survive liquidity stresses over a specified time period. Our risk appetite statement requires funding diversification, monitoring early warning indicators in the capital markets, and other related limits. ALCO reviews liquidity exposures continuously in the context of approved policy and risk appetite limits and reports results quarterly to the Risk Committee, and the Board of Directors as required.

Operational Risk

Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed processes, people or systems, external events (i.e. natural disasters) or compliance, reputational or legal matters, and includes any of those risks as they relate directly to us and our subsidiaries, as well as to third parties with whom we contract or otherwise do business. Compliance risk arises from the failure to adhere to applicable laws, rules, regulations and internal policies and procedures. Operational risk also includes model risk relating to various financial and other models used by us and our subsidiaries, including the Bank, and is subject to a formal governance process.

Strategic Risk

Strategic risk consists of the current or prospective risk to earnings and capital arising from changes in the business environment and from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of decisions or lack of responsiveness to changes in the business environment. The New Product Introduction ("NPI") Sub-Committee assesses the strategic viability and consistency of each new product or service. All new initiatives require the approval of the NPI Sub-Committee and a select number of new product requests are escalated to the MC and the Board of Directors, based on level of risk.

Risk Management Roles and Responsibilities

Responsibility for risk management flows to individuals and entities throughout our Company, including the Board of Directors, various board and management committees and senior management. The corporate culture and values, in conjunction with the risk management accountability incorporated into the integrated Risk Management Framework, which includes governance structure and three distinct Lines of Defense, has facilitated, and will continue to facilitate, the evolution of an effective risk presence across the Company.

The “First Line of Defense” is comprised of the business areas whose day-to-day activities involve decision-making and associated risk-taking for the Company. As the business owner, the first line is responsible for identifying, assessing, managing and controlling that risk, and for mitigating our overall risk exposure. The first line formulates strategy and operates within the risk appetite and risk governance framework. The “Second Line of Defense,” also known as the independent risk management organization, provides oversight of first line risk taking and management. The second line assists in determining risk capacity, risk appetite, and the strategies, policies and structure for managing risks. The second line owns the risk governance framework. The “Third Line of Defense” is comprised of Internal Audit. The third line provides independent and objective assurance to senior management and to the Board of Directors and Audit Committee that the first and second line risk management and internal control systems and its governance processes are well-designed and working as intended.










Set forth below is a further description of the roles and responsibilities related to the key elements of the risk management framework.

Board of Directors

The Board of Directors, among other things, has approved the enterprise-wide risk appetite statement and framework for the Company, as well as certain other risk management policies and oversees the Company’s strategic plan and enterprise-wide risk management program. The Board of Directors may assign certain risk management activities to applicable committees and management.

Board Committees

The Board of Directors has established four committees that assist the board in its oversight of risk management. These committees and their risk-related roles are described below.

Audit Committee

In coordination with the Risk Committees of the Company and the Bank, the Audit Committee’s role, among other things, is to review: (i) the Company’s major financial risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control these risks; (ii) the Company’s risk assessment and risk management practices and the guidelines, policies and processes for risk assessment and risk management; (iii) the organization, performance and audit findings of our internal audit function; (iv) our public disclosures and effectiveness of internal controls; and (v) the Company’s risk guidelines and policies relating to financial statements, financial systems, financial reporting processes, compliance and auditing, and allowance for loan losses.

Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee

The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review and approve certain transactions with related persons; (ii) review and resolve any conflict of interest involving directors or executive officers; (iii) oversee the risks, if any, related to corporate governance structure and practices; and (iv) identify and discuss with management the risks, if any, related to social responsibility actions and public policy initiatives.

Management Development and Compensation Committee

The Management Development and Compensation Committee’s role, among other things, is to: (i) review our incentive compensation arrangements with a view to appropriately balancing risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose us or any of our subsidiaries to imprudent risks, and are consistent with safety and soundness; and (ii) review (with input from our CRO and the Bank’s CRO) the relationship between risk management policies and practices, corporate strategies and senior executive compensation.










Risk Committee

Management Committees

There are four management committees with important roles and responsibilities in the risk management function: the MC and the ERMC, the ALCO and the CMC. These committees and their risk-related roles are described below.

Management Committee

The MC is under the oversight of the Board of Directors and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. The MC has responsibility for reviewing and approving lending and investment activities of the Company, such as equity investments, acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures, portfolio deals and investment issues regarding the Company. It is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s approach to managing its investments, reviewing and approving the Company’s annual strategic plan and annual operating plan, and overseeing activities administered by its Credit, Culture, Information Technology, New Product Introduction, Investment Review and Pricing subcommittees. The MC also reviews management reports provided on a periodic basis, or as requested, in order to monitor evolving issues, effectiveness of risk mitigation activities and performance against strategic plans. The MC may make decisions only within the authority that is granted to it by the Board of Directors and must escalate any investment or other proposals outside of its authority to the Board of Directors for final decision.

ERMC

The ERMC is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of senior executives and chaired by the CRO. The ERMC has responsibility for risk oversight across the Company and for reporting on material risks to our Risk Committee. The responsibilities of the ERMC include the day-to-day oversight of risks impacting the Company, establishing a risk appetite statement and ensuring compliance across the Company with the overall risk appetite. The ERMC also oversees establishment of risk management policies, the performance and functioning of the relevant overall risk management function, and the implementation of appropriate governance activities and systems that support control of risks.










ALCO

The ALCO is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the Treasurer. It identifies, measures, monitors, manages and controls market, liquidity and credit (investments and bank relationships) risks to the Company’s balance sheet. ALCO activities include reviewing and monitoring cash management, investments, liquidity, funding and foreign exchange risk activities and overseeing the safe, sound and efficient operation of the Company in compliance with applicable policies, laws and regulations.

CMC

The CMC is a management committee under the oversight of the Risk Committee and is comprised of our senior executives and chaired by the SVP, Capital Management and Stress Testing. The CMC provides oversight of the Company’s capital management, stress testing, and recovery and resolution planning activities. The CMC supports the Risk Committee in overseeing capital management activities such as the Annual Capital Plan, the Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process, the Dodd-Frank Act Stress Testing, the Pre-Provision Net Revenue and Credit Loss Methodologies, the Contingent Capital Plan as needed in the event of a breach, and the Recovery and Resolution Planning Process.

Chief Executive Officer, Chief Risk Officer and Other Senior Officers

The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) has ultimate responsibility for ensuring the management of the Company’s risk in accordance with the Company’s approved risk appetite statement, including through her role as chairperson of the MC. The CEO also provides leadership in communicating the risk appetite to internal and external stakeholders to help embed appropriate risk taking into the overall corporate culture of the Company.

The CRO manages our risk management team and, as chairperson of the ERMC, is responsible for establishing and implementing standards for the identification, management, measurement, monitoring and reporting of risk on an enterprise-wide basis. In collaboration with our CEO and the Chief Financial Officer, the CRO has responsibility for developing an appropriate risk appetite with corresponding limits that aligns with supervisory expectations, and this risk appetite statement has been approved by the Board of Directors. The CRO regularly reports to the Board of Directors and the Risk Committee on risk management matters.

The senior executive officers who serve as leaders in the "First Line of Defense," are responsible for ensuring that their respective functions operate within established risk limits, in accordance with the Company’s enterprise risk management policy. As members of the ERMC and the MC, they are also responsible for identifying risks, considering risk when developing strategic plans, budgets and new products and implementing appropriate risk controls when pursuing business strategies and objectives. In addition, senior executive officers are responsible for deploying sufficient financial resources and qualified personnel to manage the risks inherent in the Company’s business activities.

Risk Management

The risk management team, including compliance, led by the CRO, provides oversight of our risk profile and is responsible for maintaining a compliance program that includes compliance risk assessment, policy development, testing and reporting activities. This team effectively serves in a “Second Line of Defense” role by overseeing the operating activities of the “First Line of Defense.”

Internal Audit Team

The internal audit team is responsible for performing periodic, independent reviews and testing of compliance with the Company’s and the Bank’s risk management policies and standards, as well as with regulatory guidance and industry best practices. The internal audit team also assesses the design of the Company's and the Bank's policies and standards and validates the effectiveness of risk management controls, and reports the results of such reviews to the Audit Committee. The internal audit team effectively serves as the “Third Line of Defense” for the Company.










Enterprise Risk Assessment Process

The Enterprise Risk Assessment process (ERA) is a top-down process designed to identify, assess and quantify risk across the Company’s primary risk categories and serves as a basis to determine the Company’s risk profile. Enterprise risk assessments play an important role in directing the risk management activities by helping prioritize initiatives and focus resources on the most appropriate risks. The risk leader for each risk category directs the assessment process, reviewing not only the current type and level of risks, but also compliance with regulatory guidance and industry best practices as well as policy and procedural compliance. Progress against any action plans that have been put into place to manage key risks are tracked and reported to the ERMC. The ERA is performed annually and refreshed periodically, and is the basis of the Material Risk Inventory used in the strategic and capital planning processes.

Stress testing activities provide a forward-looking assessment of risks and losses. Stress testing is integrated into the strategic, capital and liquidity planning processes, and the results are used to identify portfolio vulnerabilities and develop risk mitigation strategies or contingency plans across a range of stressed conditions.

Risk Appetite Framework

We operate in accordance with a risk appetite statement setting forth objectives, plans and limits, and expressing preferences with respect to risk-taking activities in the context of overall business goals. The risk appetite statement is approved annually by the ERMC and the Board of Directors, with delegated authority to the CRO for implementation throughout the Company. The risk appetite statement serves as a tool to preclude activities that are inconsistent with the business and risk strategy. The risk appetite statement will be reviewed and approved at least annually as part of the business planning process and will be modified, as necessary, to include updated risk tolerances by risk category, enabling us to meet prescribed goals while continuing to operate within established risk boundaries.

Regulation

____________________________________________________________________________________________

General

Our business, including our relationships with our customers, is subject to regulation, supervision and examination under U.S. federal, state and foreign laws and regulations. These laws and regulations cover all aspects of our business, including lending practices, treatment of our customers, safeguarding deposits, customer privacy and information security, capital structure, liquidity, dividends and other capital distributions, transactions with affiliates, and conduct and qualifications of personnel.

As a savings and loan holding company and financial holding company, Synchrony is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. As a large provider of consumer financial services, we are also subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the CFPB.

The Bank is a federally chartered savings association. As such, the Bank is subject to regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, which is its primary regulator, and by the CFPB. In addition, the Bank, as an insured depository institution, is supervised by the FDIC.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

The Dodd-Frank Act, which was enacted in July 2010, significantly restructured the financial regulatory regime in the United States. As discussed further throughout this section, certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to rules that are taking effect over several years, making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on us or across the industry. See also “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”










Savings and Loan Holding Company Regulation

Overview

As a savings and loan holding company, we are required to register and file periodic reports with, and are subject to regulation, supervision and examination by, the Federal Reserve Board. The Federal Reserve Board has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as liquidity risk management, securitizations, operational risk management, internal controls and audit systems, business continuity, and compensation and other employee benefits. We are regularly reviewed and examined by the Federal Reserve Board, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of our business that require our response and attention.

The Federal Reserve Board has broad enforcement authority over us and our subsidiaries (other than the Bank and the its subsidiaries). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to serve as a source of financial strength for any insured depository institution that we control, such as the Bank.

Capital

As a stand-alone savings and loan holding company, Synchrony is subject to capital requirements.

The following are the minimum capital ratios to which Synchrony is subject:

•under the Basel III standardized approach, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a mandatory conservation buffer of2.5%, which will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of2.5%), and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of2.5%); and

•a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of4%.

For a discussion of our capital ratios, see “Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital.”

We are also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the Federal Reserve Board’s stress test regulations, we are required to utilize stress-testing methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress. Although as a savings and loan holding company and a financial holding company, we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) rule, the Federal Reserve Board may in the future require us to comply with the CCAR process or some modified version of the CCAR process. Under this process, the Federal Reserve Board would measure our regulatory capital levels under various stress scenarios. Further, while as a savings and loan holding company we currently are not subject to the Federal Reserve Board’s capital planning rule, we prepare and submit a form of capital plan to the Federal Reserve Board for its review.

Liquidity

As a savings and loan holding company with total consolidated assets in excess of $50 billion, we are required to comply with the modified Liquidity Coverage Ratio Rule (“modified LCR Rule”) approved by the Federal Reserve Board in 2014.  The modified LCR Rule requires us to calculate, on a monthly basis, the ratio of the amount of our high quality liquid assets to our expected total net cash outflows over a 30-day stress period (“modified LCR Ratio”), and to maintain a modified LCR Ratio above 1.0. Under a rule adopted by the Federal Reserve Board in December 2016, we will be required to disclose our modified LCR Ratio and other associated liquidity data on a quarterly basis commencing with the fourth quarter of 2018.










In addition to the modified LCR Rule, we may in the future be required to comply with rules adopted by the Federal Reserve Board to implement the Basel III Net Stable Funding Ratio (“NSFR”) in the United States, which would require us to maintain a minimum acceptable amount of stable funding based on our liquidity characteristics over a one-year period. In June 2016, the Federal Reserve Board proposed a rule to implement the NSFR in the United States. Under the proposed rule, we would be subject to a modified NSFR, which would be calibrated at 70 percent of the amount of stable funding that would be required of depository institution holding companies with $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more in total on-balance sheet foreign exposure.

Finally, the Federal Reserve Board requires bank holding companies of a similar size to us to comply with certain Enhanced Prudential Standards with respect to liquidity management.  Among other things, such bank holding companies must maintain diversified liquidity buffers and must regularly conduct liquidity stress tests.  While, as a savings and loan holding company, we are not subject to the same Enhanced Prudential Standards that apply to comparable size bank holding companies, we currently comply with many aspects of the liquidity management requirements in those Enhanced Prudential Standards, including the diversified buffer and stress testing requirements.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

We are limited in our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our stock by the Federal Reserve Board, including on the basis that doing so would be an unsafe or unsound banking practice. Where we intend to declare or pay a dividend, we generally will be required to inform and consult with the Federal Reserve Board in advance to ensure that such dividend does not raise supervisory concerns. It is the policy of the Federal Reserve Board that a savings and loan holding company like us should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings, and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition.

According to guidance from the Federal Reserve Board, our dividend policies will be assessed against, among other things, our ability to achieve applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements. If we do not achieve applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements, we may not be able to pay dividends. Although we currently expect to meet applicable Basel III capital ratio requirements, inclusive of the capital conservation buffer when it is fully phased in by the Federal Reserve Board, we cannot be sure that we will meet those requirements or that even if we do, if we will be able to pay dividends.

In evaluating the appropriateness of a proposed redemption or repurchase of stock, the Federal Reserve Board will consider, among other things, the potential loss that we may suffer from the prospective need to increase reserves and write down assets as a result of continued asset deterioration, and our ability to raise additional common equity and other capital to replace the stock that will be redeemed or repurchased. The Federal Reserve Board also will consider the potential negative effects on our capital structure of replacing common stock with any lower-tier form of regulatory capital issued. Moreover, the approval process for any capital plan we are required to submit could result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends or make other capital distributions. See “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Failure by Synchrony and the Bank to meet applicable capital adequacy and liquidity requirements could have a material adverse effect on us” and “—We are subject to restrictions that limit our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock; the Bank is subject to restrictions that limit its ability to pay dividends to us, which could limit our ability to pay dividends, repurchase our common stock or make payments on our indebtedness.”

Activities

In general, savings and loan holding companies may only conduct, or acquire control of companies engaged in, financial activities as permitted under the relevant provisions of the Bank Holding Company Act and the Home Owners' Loan Act ("HOLA"). Savings and loan holding companies that have elected financial holding company status generally can engage in a broader range of financial activities than are otherwise permissible for savings and loan holding companies, including securities underwriting, dealing and making markets in securities, and making merchant banking investments in non-financial companies. Synchrony made an election for financial holding company status in June 2017.










The Federal Reserve has the authority to limit a financial holding company’s ability to conduct otherwise permissible activities if the financialholding company or any of its depositary institution subsidiaries ceases to meet the applicable eligibility requirements,including requirements that the financial holding company and each of its U.S. depository institution subsidiaries maintain their status as “well-capitalized” and “well-managed.” The Federal Reserve may also impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may, for example, require divestiture of the holding company’s depository institutions if the deficiencies persist. Federal regulations additionally provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain at least a “Satisfactory” rating under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), the financial holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in additional activities that are permissible only for financial holding companies.

In addition, we are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit in certain respects the types of acquisitions and investments that we can make. For example, certain acquisitions of and investments in depository institutions or their holding companies that we may undertake are subject to the prior review and approval of our banking regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC. Our banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve such acquisitions and investments. In deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition or investment, federal bank regulators may consider, among other factors: (i) the effect of the acquisition or investment on competition, (ii) our financial condition and future prospects, including current and projected capital ratios and levels, (iii) the competence, experience and integrity of our management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations, (iv) the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including our record of compliance under the CRA, (v) our effectiveness in combating money laundering, and (vi) any risks that the proposed acquisition poses to the U.S. banking or financial system.

Certain acquisitions of our voting stock may be subject to regulatory approval or notice under federal law. Investors are responsible for ensuring that they do not, directly or indirectly, acquire shares of our stock in excess of the amount that can be acquired without regulatory approval under the Change in Bank Control Act and the HOLA, which prohibit any person or company from acquiring control of us without, in most cases, the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board.

Savings Association Regulation

Overview

The Bank is required to file periodic reports with the OCC and is subject to regulation, supervision, and examination by the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB. The OCC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings, internal controls and audit systems, risk management, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. The Bank is periodically examined by the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB, which results in supervisory comments and directions relating to many aspects of the Bank’s business that require the Bank’s response and attention. In addition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the CFPB have broad enforcement authority over the Bank.

Capital

The Bank is required by OCC regulations to maintain specified levels of regulatory capital. Institutions that are not well-capitalized are subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits. The OCC is authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against an institution that fails to meet the minimum ratios for an adequately capitalized institution. AtDecember 31, 2017, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized under OCC regulations.

The following are the minimum capital ratios to which the Bank is subject:

•under the Basel III standardized approach, a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7% (the minimum of 4.5% plus a mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%, which will be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (the minimum of 6% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%), and a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8% plus a phased-in mandatory conservation buffer of 2.5%); and

•a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4%.










For a discussion of the Bank’s capital ratios, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital.”

The Bank is also required to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. Under the OCC’s stress test regulations, the Bank is required to utilize stress-testing methodologies providing for results under various scenarios of economic and financial market stress.

As an insured depository institution, the Bank is also subject to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), which requires, among other things, the federal banking agencies to take “prompt corrective action” in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. The FDIA sets forth the following five capital tiers: “well-capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” and “critically undercapitalized.” A depository institution’s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors that are established by regulation. To be well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA, the Bank must maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8%, a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10%, and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 5%, and not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by the OCC to meet or maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. AtDecember 31, 2017, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA.

In addition, the Bank is required to comply with prudential regulation in connection with liquidity.  In particular, under OCC guidelines establishing heightened standards for governance and risk management (the "Heightened Standards"), the Bank is required to establish liquidity stress testing and planning processes, which the Bank has done. For a discussion of the Heightened Standards, see “—Heightened Standards for Risk Management Governance” below.

Dividends and Stock Repurchases

OCC regulations limit the ability of savings associations to make distributions of capital, including payment of dividends, stock redemptions and repurchases, cash-out mergers and other transactions charged to the capital account. The Bank must obtain the OCC’s approval or give the OCC prior notice before making a capital distribution in certain circumstances, including if the Bank proposes to make a capital distribution when it does not meet certain capital requirements (or will not do so as a result of the proposed capital distribution) or certain net income requirements. In addition, the Bank must file a prior written notice of a planned or declared dividend or other distribution with the Federal Reserve Board. The OCC or the Federal Reserve Board may object to a capital distribution if: among other things, (i) the Bank is, or as a result of such distribution would be, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized, (ii) the regulators have safety and soundness concerns or (iii) the distribution violates a prohibition in a statute, regulation, agreement between us and the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board, or a condition imposed on us in an application or notice approved by the OCC or the Federal Reserve Board. Additional restrictions on dividends apply if the Bank fails the QTL test (described below under “—Activities”).

The FDIA also prohibits any insured depository institution from making any capital distributions (including payment of a dividend) or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be “undercapitalized.” If a depository institution is less than adequately capitalized, it must prepare and submit a capital restoration plan to its primary federal regulator for approval. For a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, among other things, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with the capital restoration plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan, it is treated as if it is “significantly undercapitalized.” A “significantly undercapitalized” depository institution may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become “adequately capitalized,” elect a new Board of Directors, reduce total assets or cease taking deposits from correspondent banks. A “critically undercapitalized” institution may be subject to the appointment of a conservator or receiver which could sell or liquidate the institution, be required to refrain from making payments on its subordinated debt, or be subject to additional restrictions on its activities.










Activities

Under HOLA, the OCC requires the Bank to comply with the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL” test. Under the QTL test, the Bank is required to maintain at least65.00%of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less (i) specified liquid assets up to20.00%of total assets, (ii) intangibles, including goodwill and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including certain mortgage-backed securities, credit card loans, student loans and small business loans) in at least nine months of the most recent 12-month period. The Bank currently meets that test. A savings association that fails to meet the QTL test is subject to certain operating restrictions and may be required to convert to a national bank charter.

Savings associations, including the Bank, are subject as well to limitations on their lending and investments. These limitations include percentage of asset limitations on various types of loans the Bank may make. In addition, there are similar limitations on the types and amounts of investments the Bank may make.

Insured depository institutions, including the Bank, are subject to restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act (as implemented by Federal Reserve Board Regulation W), which govern transactions between an insured depository institution and an affiliate, including an entity that is the institution’s direct or indirect holding company and a nonbank subsidiary of such a holding company. Restrictions in Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act apply to “covered transactions” such as extensions of credit, issuances of guarantees or asset purchases. In general, these restrictions require that any extensions of credit made by the insured depository institution to an affiliate must be fully secured with qualifying collateral and that the aggregate amount of covered transactions is limited, as to any one affiliate of the Bank, to 10% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus, and, as to all of the Bank’s affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the Bank’s capital stock and surplus. In addition, transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms and conditions that are, or in good faith would be, offered by the Bank to non-affiliated companies (i.e., at arm’s length).

The CRA is a federal law that generally requires an insured depository institution to identify the communities it serves and to make loans and investments, offer products and provide services, in each case designed to meet the credit needs of these communities. The CRA also requires an institution to maintain comprehensive records of CRA activities to demonstrate how it is meeting the credit needs of communities. These records are subject to periodic examination by the responsible federal banking agency of the institution. Based on these examinations, the agency rates the institution’s compliance with CRA as “Outstanding,” “Satisfactory,” “Needs to Improve” or “Substantial Noncompliance.” The CRA requires the agency to take into account the record of an institution in meeting the credit needs of the entire communities served, including low- and moderate- income neighborhoods, in determining such rating. Failure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit the institution or its holding company from undertaking certain activities, including acquisitions. The Bank received a CRA rating of “Satisfactory” as of its most recent CRA examination.

The FDIA prohibits insured banks from accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than the prevailing rate in the bank’s normal market area or nationally (depending upon where the deposits are solicited) unless it is “well-capitalized,” or it is “adequately capitalized” and receives a waiver from the FDIC. A bank that is “adequately capitalized” and that accepts brokered deposits under a waiver from the FDIC may not pay an interest rate on any deposit in excess of 75 basis points over certain prevailing market rates. There are no such restrictions under the FDIA on a bank that is “well-capitalized.” Further, “undercapitalized” institutions are subject to growth limitations. AtDecember 31, 2017, the Bank met or exceeded all applicable requirements to be deemed well-capitalized for purposes of the FDIA. An inability to accept brokered deposits in the future could materially adversely impact our funding costs and liquidity.

Deposit Insurance

The FDIA requires the Bank to pay deposit insurance assessments. Deposit insurance assessments are affected by the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the federal Deposit Insurance Fund (the “DIF”). The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum reserve ratio with respect to the DIF to1.35%and removed the statutory cap on the reserve ratio. The FDIC subsequently adopted a designated ratio of2%and may increase that ratio in the future. Under the FDIC’s current deposit insurance assessment methodology, the Bank is required to pay deposit insurance assessments based on its average consolidated total assets, less average tangible equity, and various other regulatory factors included in an FDIC assessment scorecard.










In March 2016, the Board of Directors of the FDIC approved a final rule to increase the DIF reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum level of 1.35 percent. Under a rule adopted by the FDIC in 2011, regular assessment rates for all banks decrease after the reserve ratio first reaches 1.15 percent. Under the final rule adopted in March 2016, banks with at least $10 billion in assets are subject to a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of the assessment base, after making certain adjustments, also after the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent. The FDIC expects the reserve ratio will likely reach 1.35 percent after approximately two years of payments of these surcharges. The decrease in regular assessment rates and the surcharge for banks with $10 billion in assets both became effective beginning the third quarter of 2016, which is the first quarter after the reserve ratio reached 1.15 percent.

The FDIA creates a depositor preference regime for the resolution of all insured depository institutions, including the Bank. If any such institution is placed into receivership, the FDIC will pay (out of the remaining net assets of the failed institution and only to the extent of such assets) first secured creditors (to the extent of their security), second the administrative expenses of the receivership, third all deposits liabilities (both insured and uninsured), fourth any other general or senior liabilities, fifth any obligations subordinated to depositors or general creditors, and finally any remaining net assets to shareholders in that capacity.

Resolution and Recovery Planning

The Bank is required annually to submit to the FDIC a plan for the Bank’s resolution in the event of its failure. The plan is designed to enable the FDIC, if appointed receiver for the Bank, to resolve the Bank under sections 11 and 13 of the FDIA in a manner that ensures that its depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the Bank's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of the Bank’s assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution. The resolution plan requirement is intended to ensure that the FDIC has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve the Bank efficiently in the event of its failure.

In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidance that will require the Bank to develop and maintain a recovery plan that identifies triggers and options for responding to a wide range of severe internal and external stress scenarios and for restoring the Bank, to the extent it is experiencing or is likely to experience considerable financial or operational stress, to financial strength and viability in a timely manner. The Bank will be required to have in place its recovery plan under this guidance by July 1, 2018.

Heightened Standards for Risk Management Governance

The OCC’s Heightened Standards establish guidelines for the governance and risk management practices of large OCC-regulated institutions, including the Bank. These Heightened Standards require covered banks to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risk-taking activities, provide standards for covered banks’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework, and describe the appropriate risk management roles and responsibilities of front line units, independent risk management, and internal audit functions. The Bank believes it complies with the Heightened Standards.










Consumer Financial Services Regulation

Violations of applicable consumer protection laws can result in significant potential liability from litigation brought by customers, including actual damages, restitution and attorneys’ fees. Federal banking regulators, as well as state attorneys general and other state and local consumer protection agencies, also may seek to enforce consumer protection requirements and obtain these and other remedies, including civil money penalties and fines.

The CARD Act was enacted in 2009 and most of the requirements became effective in 2010. The CARD Act made numerous amendments to the Truth in Lending Act, requiring us to make significant changes to many of our business practices, including marketing, underwriting, pricing and billing. The CARD Act’s restrictions on our ability to increase interest rates on existing balances to respond to market conditions and credit risk ultimately limits our ability to extend credit to new customers and provide additional credit to current customers. Other CARD Act restrictions, such as limitations on late fees, have resulted and will continue to result in reduced interest income and loan fee income.

The FCRA regulates our use of credit reports and the reporting of information to credit reporting agencies, and also provides a standard for lenders to share information with affiliates and certain third parties and to provide firm offers of credit to consumers. The FCRA also places further restrictions on the use of information shared between affiliates for marketing purposes, requires the provision of disclosures to consumers when risk-based pricing is used in a credit decision, and requires safeguards to help protect consumers from identity theft.

Under HOLA, the Bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers. In general, the Bank may not extend credit, lease or sell property, or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these on the condition that: (i) the customer obtain or provide some additional credit, property, or services from or to the Bank or Synchrony or their subsidiaries or (ii) the customer may not obtain some other credit, property, or services from a competitor, except in each case to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended. Certain arrangements are permissible. For example, the Bank may offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products.










The Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which regulates consumer financial products and services and certain financial services providers. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” and ensure consistent enforcement of laws so that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services that are fair, transparent and competitive. The CFPB has rulemaking and interpretive authority under the Dodd-Frank Act and other federal consumer financial services laws, as well as broad supervisory, examination and enforcement authority over large providers of consumer financial products and services, such as us. In addition, the CFPB has an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the products we offer. The system could inform future agency decisions with respect to regulatory, enforcement or examination focus. There continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities will impact our business and our results of operations going forward. See “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—There continues to be uncertainty as to how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s actions will impact our business; the agency’s actions have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on our business.”

If pre-dispute arbitration provisions are not enforceable or eliminated (for whatever reason), our exposure to class action litigation could increase significantly. See “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—Litigation, regulatory actions and compliance issues could subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments, remediation costs and/or requirements resulting in increased expenses.”

Privacy

We are subject to various privacy, information security and data protection laws, including requirements concerning security breach notification. For example, in the United States, certain of our businesses are subject to the GLBA and implementing regulations and guidance. Among other things, the GLBA: (i) imposes certain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to share consumers’ nonpublic personal information with nonaffiliated third parties, (ii) requires that financial institutions provide certain disclosures to consumers about their information collection, sharing and security practices and affords customers the right to “opt out” of the institution’s disclosure of their personal financial information to nonaffiliated third parties (with certain exceptions) and (iii) requires financial institutions to develop, implement and maintain a written comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution’s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution’s activities, the sensitivity of customer information processed by the financial institution as well as plans for responding to data security breaches. Federal and state laws also require us to respond appropriately to data security breaches. We have a program to comply with applicable privacy, information security, and data protection requirements imposed by federal, state, and foreign laws, including the GLBA. See also “

Item 1A.

Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Prevention Program

We maintain an enterprise-wide program designed to enable us to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act. This program includes policies, procedures, processes and other internal controls designed to identify, monitor, manage and mitigate the risk of money laundering or terrorist financing posed by our products, services, customers and geographic locale. These controls include procedures and processes to detect and report suspicious transactions, perform customer due diligence, respond to requests from law enforcement, and meet all recordkeeping and reporting requirements related to particular transactions involving currency or monetary instruments. The program is coordinated by a compliance officer, undergoes an annual independent audit to assess its effectiveness, and requires training of employees.

In May 2016, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) promulgated a final rule under the Bank Secrecy Act that requires the Bank to adopt due diligence procedures to identify and verify a legal entity customer’s beneficial owner(s) at the time a new account is opened and to understand the nature and purpose of the customer relationship. The Bank will be required to comply with the final rule by May 11, 2018, and is currently working on changes to its product and channel strategies, application and servicing processes and systems to ensure compliance. See “Item 1A.Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Regulation—Failure to comply with anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing laws could have significant adverse consequences for us.”










Sanctions Programs

We have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered and enforced by OFAC. These sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals. We maintain policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs.
