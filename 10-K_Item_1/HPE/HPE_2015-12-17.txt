ITEM 1. Business.

We are a leading global provider of the cutting-edge technology solutions customers need to optimize their traditional Information
Technology ("IT") while helping them build the secure, cloud-enabled, mobile-ready future that is uniquely suited to their needs. Our legacy dates
back to a partnership founded in 1939 by William R. Hewlett and David Packard, and we strive every day to uphold and enhance that legacy through our dedication to providing innovative technological
solutions to our customers.

On
November 1, 2015, HP Inc. (formerly known as "Hewlett-Packard Company" or "HP Co.") spun-off Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company ("we", "us", "our", "Hewlett
Packard Enterprise", "HPE", or "the Company"), pursuant to a separation agreement (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement"). To effect the spin-off, HP Inc. distributed all of the shares of
Hewlett Packard Enterprise common stock owned by HP Inc. to its shareholders on November 1, 2015. Holders of HP Inc. common stock received one share of Hewlett Packard Enterprise
stock for every share of HP Inc. stock held as of the record date. As a result of the spin-off, we now operate as an independent, publicly traded company.

We
believe that we offer the most comprehensive portfolio of enterprise solutions in the IT industry. With an industry-leading position in servers, storage, networking, converged
systems, software and services, combined with our customized financing solutions, we believe we are best equipped to deliver the right IT solutions to help drive optimal business outcomes for our
customers.

Our Strengths

We believe that we possess a number of competitive advantages that distinguish us from our competitors, including:

Broad and deep end-to-end solutions portfolio.We combine our infrastructure, software and services capabilities to provide what we
believe is the
broadest and deepest portfolio of end-to-end enterprise solutions in the IT industry. Our ability to deliver a wide range of high-quality products and high-value consulting and support services in a
single package is one of our principal differentiators.

Multiyear innovation roadmap.We have been in the technology and innovation business for over 75 years. Our vast intellectual
property
portfolio and global research and development capabilities are part of a broader innovation roadmap designed to help organizations of all sizes journey from traditional technology platforms to the IT
systems of the future—what we call the new style of IT—which we believe will be characterized by the increasing and interrelated prominence of cloud computing, big data,
enterprise security, applications and mobility.









Global distribution and partner ecosystem.We are experts in delivering innovative technological solutions
to our customers in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments. We have one of the largest go-to-market capabilities in our industry, including a large ecosystem of channel
partners, which enables us to market and deliver our product offerings to customers located virtually anywhere in the world.

Custom financial solutions.We have developed innovative financing solutions to facilitate the delivery of our products and services to
our
customers. We deliver flexible investment solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs.

Experienced leadership team with track record of successful performance.Our management team has an extensive track record of
performance and
execution. We are led by our Chief Executive Officer Margaret C. Whitman, who has proven experience in developing transformative business models, building global brands and driving sustained growth
and expansion in the technology industry, including from her leadership of HP Co. for four years prior to the separation and her previous ten years as Chief Executive Officer of
eBay Inc. Our senior management team has over 100 collective years of experience in our industry and possesses extensive knowledge of and experience in the enterprise IT business and the
markets in which we compete. Moreover, we have a deep bench of management and technology talent that we believe provides us with an unparalleled pipeline of future leaders and innovators.

Our Strategies

Disruptive change is all around us, and we are living in an idea economy where the ability to turn an idea into a new product or a new
industry is more accessible than ever. This environment requires a new style of business, underpinned by a new style of IT. Cloud, mobile, big data and analytics provide the tools enterprises need to
significantly reduce the time to market for any good idea. Hewlett Packard Enterprise's strategy is to enable customers to win in the idea economy by slashing the time it takes to turn an idea into
value.

We
make IT environments more efficient, more productive and more secure, enabling fast, flexible responses to a rapidly changing competitive landscape. We enable organizations to act
quickly on ideas by creating, consuming and reconfiguring new solutions, experiences and business models, and deliver infrastructure that is built from components that can be composed and recomposed
easily and quickly to meet the shifting demands of business applications.

Every
IT journey is unique, but every customer is looking to minimize the time between initial idea and realized value. While some customers are looking for solutions that let them take
the next step on this journey, the majority of customers are at the beginning of this journey and are looking for solutions that can help them take their first steps. Hewlett Packard Enterprise will
leverage our leadership position in our traditional markets to lead the transition to this new style of business.

Specifically,
we are focused on delivering solutions to help customers transform four critical areas that matter most to their business.

Transform to a hybrid infrastructure.Infrastructure matters more than ever today, but customers need a new kind of infrastructure. We
help customers
build an on-demand infrastructure and operational foundation for all of the applications that power the enterprise. With our cloud expertise, combined with our portfolio of traditional IT
infrastructure and services, we are able to provide customized and seamless IT solutions for customers of all sizes and at all levels of technological sophistication. We are able to optimize our
customers' applications regardless of form—traditional, mobile, in the cloud or in the data center.









Protect the digital enterprise.The threat landscape is wider and more diverse today than ever before. We offer complete risk
management solutions,
ranging from protection against security threats to data back-up and recovery, that help our customers protect themselves and their data in an increasingly volatile cybersecurity landscape. Our
products and services are informed by our decades of IT security experience and enable customers to predict and disrupt threats, manage risk and compliance, and extend their internal security team.

Empower the data-driven organization.We provide open-source solutions that allow customers to use 100% of their data, including
business data, human
data and machine data, to generate real-time, actionable insights. The result is better and faster decision making.

Enable workplace productivity.We help customers deliver rich digital and mobile experiences to their
customers, employees and partners. We offer an end-to-end mobility portfolio, from cloud infrastructure to customer-facing applications. Our infrastructure offerings leverage our cloud and security
expertise to provide the backbone for secure mobile networks. Our integrated software offerings leverage our application expertise to provide intuitive interfaces for end-users. We also leverage our
big data expertise to enable our customers to gain insight into the mobile user experience by monitoring and analyzing customer experience analytics.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We manage our business and report our financial results based on the segments described above. Our customers are organized by
commercial and large enterprise groups, including business and public sector enterprises, and purchases of our products, solutions and services may be fulfilled directly by us or indirectly through a
variety of partners, including:

•resellers that sell our products and services, frequently with their own value-added products or services, to targeted customer
groups;•distribution partners that supply our solutions to resellers;•OEMs that integrate our products and services with their own products and services, and sell the integrated solution;•independent software vendors that provide their clients with specialized software products and often assist us in selling our products
and services to clients purchasing their products;•systems integrators that provide expertise in designing and implementing custom IT solutions and often partner with us to extend their
expertise or influence the sale of our products and services; and•advisory firms that provide various levels of management and IT consulting, including some systems integration work, and typically
partner with us on client solutions that require our unique products and services.

The
mix of our business conducted by direct sales or channel differs substantially by business and region. We believe that customer buying patterns and different regional market
conditions require us to tailor our sales, marketing and distribution efforts accordingly. We are focused on driving the depth and breadth of our coverage, in addition to identifying efficiencies and
productivity gains, in both our direct and indirect businesses. While each of our business segments manages the execution of its own go-to-market and distribution strategy, our business segments also
collaborate to ensure strategic and process alignment where appropriate. For example, we typically assign an account manager, generally from EG or ES, to manage relationships across our business with
large enterprise customers. The account manager is supported by a team of specialists with product and services expertise. For other customers and for consumers, our business segments collaborate to
manage relationships with commercial resellers targeting SMBs where appropriate.









Manufacturing and Materials

We utilize a significant number of outsourced manufacturers around the world to manufacture products that we design. The use of
outsourced manufacturers is intended to generate cost efficiencies and reduce time to market for our products as well as maintain flexibility in our supply chain and manufacturing processes. In some
circumstances, third-party OEMs produce products that we purchase and resell under our brand. In addition to our use of outsourced manufacturers, we currently manufacture a limited number of
finished products from components and subassemblies that we acquire from a wide range of vendors.

We
utilize two primary methods of fulfilling demand for products: building products to order and configuring products to order. We build products to order to maximize manufacturing and
logistics efficiencies by producing high volumes of basic product configurations. Alternatively, configuring products to order enables units to match a customer's particular hardware and software
customization requirements. Our inventory management and distribution practices in both building products to order and configuring products to order seek to minimize inventory holding periods by
taking delivery of the inventory and manufacturing shortly before the sale or distribution of products to our customers.

We
purchase materials, supplies and product subassemblies from a substantial number of vendors. For most of our products, we have existing alternate sources of supply or such alternate
sources of supply are readily available. However, we do rely on sole sources for certain customized parts (although some of these sources have operations in multiple locations in the event of a
disruption). We are dependent upon Intel and AMD as suppliers of x86 processors; however, we believe that disruptions with these suppliers would result in industry-wide dislocations and therefore
would not disproportionately disadvantage us relative to our competitors.

Like
other participants in the IT industry, we ordinarily acquire materials and components through a combination of blanket and scheduled purchase orders to support our demand
requirements for periods averaging 90 to 120 days. From time to time, we may experience significant price volatility or supply constraints for certain components that are not available from
multiple sources or where our suppliers are geographically concentrated. When necessary, we are often able to obtain scarce components for somewhat higher prices on the open market, which may have an
impact on our gross margin but does not generally disrupt production. We also may acquire component inventory in anticipation of supply constraints or enter into longer-term pricing commitments with
vendors to improve the priority, price and availability of supply. See "Risk Factors—We depend on third-party suppliers, and our financial results could suffer if we fail to manage our
suppliers properly."

International

Our products and services are available worldwide. We believe this geographic diversity allows us to meet demand on a worldwide basis
for our customers, draws on business and technical expertise from a worldwide workforce, provides stability to our operations, provides revenue streams that may offset geographic economic trends and
offers us an opportunity to access new markets for maturing products. In addition, we believe that our future growth is dependent in part on our ability to develop products and sales models that
target developing countries. In this regard, we believe that our broad geographic presence gives us a solid base on which to build such future growth.

A
summary of our domestic and international results is set forth in Note 2, "Segment Information", to the Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements. Approximately 61% of our
overall net revenue in fiscal 2015 came from outside the United States.

For
a discussion of certain risks attendant to our international operations, see "Risk Factors—Due to the international nature of our business, political or economic changes
or other factors could harm our business and financial performance," "—Recent global, regional and local economic weakness and









uncertainty
could adversely affect our business and financial performance," "—We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates" in Item 1A, "Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk" in Item 7A and Note 12, "Financial Instruments", to our Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by
reference.

Research and Development

Innovation is a key element of our culture and critical to our success. Our research and development efforts are focused on designing
and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and desires and emerging technological trends. Our efforts also are focused on identifying the areas where we
believe we can make a unique contribution and where partnering with other leading technology companies will leverage our cost structure and maximize our customers' experiences.

Hewlett
Packard Labs, together with the various research and development groups within our business segments, is responsible for our research and development efforts. Hewlett Packard
Labs is part of our Corporate Investments segment.

Expenditures
for research and development were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2015, $2.2 billion in fiscal 2014 and $2.0 billion in fiscal 2013. We anticipate that we will
continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to support the design and development of innovative, high-quality products, services and solutions to maintain and
enhance our competitive position. For a discussion of risks attendant to our research and development activities, see "Risk Factors—If we cannot successfully execute our go-to-market
strategy and continue to develop, manufacture and market innovative products, services and solutions, our business and financial performance may suffer."

Patents

Our general policy is to seek patent protection for those inventions likely to be incorporated into our products and services or where
obtaining such proprietary rights will improve our competitive position. At present, our worldwide patent portfolio includes approximately 15,000 patents (including approximately 2,500 patents
attributable to H3C).

Patents
generally have a term of twenty years from the date they are filed. As our patent portfolio has been built over time, the remaining terms of the individual patents across our
patent portfolio vary. We believe that our patents and patent applications are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products and services, enhancing our freedom of action
to sell our products and services in markets in which we choose to participate, and maximizing our return on research and development investments. No single patent is in itself essential to our
company as a whole or to any of our business segments.

In
addition to developing our patent portfolio, we license intellectual property from third parties as we deem appropriate. We have also granted and continue to grant to others licenses,
and other rights, under our patents when we consider these arrangements to be in our interest. These license arrangements include a number of cross-licenses with third parties.

For
a discussion of risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors—Our financial performance may suffer if we cannot continue to develop, license or
enforce the intellectual property rights on which our businesses depend" and "—Our products and services depend in part on intellectual property and technology licensed from third
parties."

Backlog

We believe that our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects due to our diverse product and service
portfolio, including the large volume of products delivered from finished goods or channel partner inventories and the shortening of product life cycles. Therefore, we believe that backlog information
is not material to an understanding of our overall business.







Seasonality

General economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results. From time to time, the markets in which we sell our
products, services and solutions experience weak economic conditions that may negatively affect sales. We experience some seasonal trends in the sale of our products and services. For example,
European sales are often weaker in the summer months. See "Risk Factors—Our uneven sales cycle makes planning and inventory management difficult and future financial results less
predictable."

Competition

We have a broad technology portfolio of enterprise IT infrastructure products and solutions, multi-vendor customer services and IT
management software and solutions. We believe we are the leader or among the leaders in each of our business segments. Nevertheless, we encounter strong competition in all areas of our business. We
compete primarily on the basis of technology, innovation, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, reputation, distribution, range of products and services, ease of use of our products,
account relationships, customer training, service and support, security and the availability of our application software and IT infrastructure offerings.

The
markets for each of our business segments are characterized by strong competition among major corporations with long-established positions and a large number of new and rapidly
growing firms. Most product life cycles are relatively short, and to remain competitive we must develop new products and services, periodically enhance our existing products and services and compete
effectively on the basis of the factors listed above, among others. In addition, we compete with many of our current and potential partners, including OEMs that design, manufacture and market
their products under their own brand names. Our successful management of these competitive partner relationships is critical to our future success. Moreover, we anticipate that we will have to
continue to adjust prices on many of our products and services to stay competitive.

The
competitive environments in which each segment operates are described below:

Enterprise Group.EG operates in the highly competitive enterprise technology infrastructure market, which is characterized by rapid
and ongoing
technological innovation and price competition. Our primary competitors include technology vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM"), Dell Inc. ("Dell"), EMC
Corporation ("EMC"), Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco"), Lenovo Group Ltd., Oracle Corporation ("Oracle"), Fujitsu Limited ("Fujitsu"), Inspur Co., Ltd., Huawei
Technologies Co. Ltd., NetApp, Inc., Hitachi Ltd., Juniper Networks, Inc., Arista Networks, Inc., Extreme Networks, Inc., Brocade Communications
Systems, Inc., VMware, Microsoft, Google Inc., Rackspace Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. ("Amazon"). In certain regions, we also experience competition from local companies and
from generically branded or "white-box" manufacturers. Our strategy is to deliver superior products, high-value technology support services and differentiated integrated solutions that combine our
infrastructure, software and services capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our broad end-to-end solutions portfolio, supported by our strong intellectual property portfolio and research
and development capabilities, coupled with our global reach and partner ecosystem.

Enterprise Services.ES competes in the IT services, consulting and integration, infrastructure technology outsourcing, business
process outsourcing
and application services markets. Our primary competitors
include IBM Global Services, Computer Sciences Corporation, systems integration firms such as Accenture plc and offshore companies such as Fujitsu and India-based competitors Wipro Limited,
Infosys Limited and Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. We also compete with other traditional hardware providers, such as Dell, which are increasingly offering services to support their products,
new players in emerging areas like cloud such as Amazon, and smaller local players. Many of our competitors offer a wide range of global services, and some of our competitors enjoy significant brand









recognition.
ES teams with many companies to offer services, and those arrangements allow us to extend our reach and augment our capabilities. Our competitive advantages include our deep technology
expertise, especially in complex multi-country, multi-vendor and/or multi-language environments, our differentiated intellectual property, our strong track record of collaboration with clients and
partners, and the combination of our expertise in infrastructure management with skilled global resources on platforms from SAP AG ("SAP"), Oracle and Microsoft, among others.

Software.The markets in which our Software segment operates are characterized by rapidly changing customer requirements and
technologies. We design
and develop enterprise IT management software in competition with IBM, CA Technologies, Inc., VMware, BMC Software, Inc. and others. Our big data solutions, which include data analytics
and information governance offerings incorporating both structured and unstructured data, compete with products from companies like Adobe Systems Inc., IBM, EMC, Open Text Corporation, Oracle
and Symantec Corporation. We also deliver enterprise security/risk intelligence solutions that compete with products from EMC, IBM, Cisco and Intel. As customers are becoming increasingly comfortable
with newer delivery mechanisms such as SaaS, we are facing competition from smaller, less traditional competitors, particularly for customers with smaller IT organizations. Our differentiation lies in
the breadth and depth of our software and services portfolio, our collaboration with EG and ES to provide comprehensive IT solutions and the scope of our market coverage.

Hewlett Packard Financial Services.In our financing business, our competitors are captive financing companies, mainly IBM Global
Financing, as well
as banks and other financial institutions. We believe our competitive advantage over banks and other financial institutions in our financing business is our ability to deliver flexible investment
solutions and expertise that help customers and other partners create unique technology deployments based on specific business needs.

For
a discussion of certain risks attendant to these competitive environments, see "Risk Factors—We operate in an intensely competitive industry and competitive pressures
could harm our business and financial performance."

Environment

Our operations are subject to regulation under various federal, state, local and foreign laws concerning the environment, including
laws addressing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, and the clean-up of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial
costs, including clean-up costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, and third-party damage or personal injury claims, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws.

Many
of our products are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws governing chemical substances in products and their safe use, including laws restricting the presence
of certain substances in electronics products and in some cases laws regulating the manufacture and distribution of chemical substances. Some of our products and services also are, or may in the
future be, subject to requirements applicable to their energy consumption. In addition, we face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new and future
requirements relating to the chemical and materials composition of our products, their safe use, and their energy efficiency, including requirements relating to climate change. We are also subject to
legislation in an increasing number of jurisdictions that makes producers of electrical goods, including servers and networking equipment, financially responsible for specified collection, recycling,
treatment and disposal of past and future covered products (sometimes referred to as "product take-back legislation"). In the event our products become non-compliant with these laws, our products
could be restricted from entering certain jurisdictions and we could face other sanctions, including fines.









Our
operations, services and ultimately our products are expected to become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties
relating to climate change. As these laws, regulations, treaties and similar initiatives and programs are adopted and implemented throughout the world, we will be required to comply or potentially
face market access limitations or other sanctions, including fines. However, we believe that technology will be fundamental to finding solutions to achieve compliance with and manage those
requirements, and we are collaborating with industry and business groups and governments to find and promote ways that our technology can be used to address climate change and to facilitate compliance
with related laws, regulations and treaties.

We
are committed to maintaining compliance with all environmental laws applicable to our operations, products and services and to reducing our environmental impact across all aspects of
our business. We
meet this commitment with a comprehensive environmental, health and safety policy, strict environmental management of our operations and worldwide environmental programs and services.

Environmental
costs and accruals are presently not material to our operations, cash flows or financial position. Although there is no assurance that existing or future environmental laws
applicable to our operations or products will not have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flows or financial condition, we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for
environmental control facilities.

Employees

We had approximately 240,000 employees as of October 31, 2015.
