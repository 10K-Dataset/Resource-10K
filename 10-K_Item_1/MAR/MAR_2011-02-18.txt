Item 1.Business.

We are a
worldwide operator and franchisor of hotels and related lodging facilities. We were organized as a corporation in Delaware in 1997 and became a public company in 1998 when we were “spun off” as a separate entity by the company formerly
named “Marriott International, Inc.” Our operations are grouped into the following five business segments:



SegmentPercentage of 2010Total
RevenuesNorth American Full-Service Lodging Segment44%North American Limited-Service Lodging Segment18%International Lodging Segment11%Luxury Lodging Segment13%Timeshare Segment13%Other unallocated corporate1%

We develop, operate, and
franchise hotels and corporate housing properties under numerous separate brand names, and we develop, operate, and market timeshare, fractional ownership, and residential properties under four separate brand names. We also provide services to
home/condominium owner associations for projects associated with several of our brands.

Financial information by segment and
geographic area for 2010, 2009, and 2008 appears in Footnote No. 17, “Business Segments,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements included in this annual report.







Lodging

We operate or franchise 3,545 lodging properties worldwide, with 618,104 rooms as of year-end 2010 inclusive of 36 home and condominium products (3,737 units) for which we manage the related owners’
associations. In addition, we provided 2,043 furnished corporate housing rental units, which are not included in the totals. We believe that our portfolio of lodging brands is the broadest of any company in the world and that we are the leader in
the quality tier of the vacation timesharing business. Consistent with our focus on management and franchising, we own very few of our lodging properties. We manage and franchise lodging properties employing the following brands:

Company-Operated Lodging Properties

At year-end 2010, we operated 1,104 properties (284,868 rooms) under long-term management agreements with property owners, 45 properties (10,957 rooms) under long-term lease agreements with property
owners (management and lease agreements together, “the Operating Agreements”), and five properties (986 rooms) as owned. The figures noted for properties operated under long-term management agreements include 36 home and condominium
products (3,737 units) for which we manage the related owners’ associations.

Terms of our management agreements vary,
but typically, we earn a management fee, which comprises a base management fee, which is a percentage of the revenues of the hotel, and an incentive management fee, which is based on the profits of the hotel. Our management agreements also typically
include reimbursement of costs of operations (both direct and indirect). Such agreements are generally for initial periods of 20 to 30 years, with options for us to renew for up to 50 or more additional years. Our lease agreements also vary, but may
include fixed annual rentals plus additional rentals based on a percentage of annual revenues in excess of a fixed amount. Many of the Operating Agreements are subordinated to mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness of the owners.
Additionally, many of our Operating Agreements permit the owners to terminate the agreement if certain performance metrics are not met and financial returns fail to meet defined levels for a period of time and we have not cured such deficiencies.

For lodging facilities that we operate, we generally are responsible for hiring, training, and supervising the managers and
employees required to operate the facilities and for purchasing supplies, both for which we generally are reimbursed by the owners. We provide centralized reservation services and national advertising, marketing and promotional services, as well as
various accounting and data processing services. We are generally reimbursed by owners for the cost of providing these services.







Franchised Lodging Properties

We have franchising programs that permit the use of many of our lodging brand names and systems by other hotel owners and operators. Under
these programs, we generally receive an initial application fee and continuing royalty fees, which typically range from four percent to six percent of room revenues for all brands, plus two percent to three percent of food and beverage revenues for
certain full-service hotels. In addition, franchisees contribute to our national marketing and advertising programs and pay fees for use of our centralized reservation systems.

At year-end 2010, we had 2,391 franchised properties (321,293 rooms).

Timeshare and Residential

We develop, operate, market,
and sell timeshare interval, fractional ownership, and residential properties under four brand names and generate revenues from three primary sources: (1) selling fee simple and other forms of timeshare intervals and personal residences;
(2) financing consumer purchases; and (3) operating the resorts. During 2010 we broadened our timeshare interval product offering to include the sale of the points-based Marriott Vacation Club DestinationsTMprogram in North America and the Caribbean. The Marriott Vacation
Club Destinations program offers greater flexibility, further personalization, and more experience opportunities for Owners. See the “Marriott Vacation Club Destinations Timeshare Program” caption later in this Form 10-K for additional
information. Many resorts are located adjacent to company-operated hotels, such as Marriott Hotels & Resorts and The Ritz-Carlton, and owners have access to certain hotel facilities during their vacation. Owners can trade their annual
interval for intervals at other Marriott timesharing resorts or for intervals at certain timesharing resorts not otherwise sponsored by Marriott through a third-party exchange company. Owners can also trade their unused interval for points in our
frequent guest programs, enabling them to stay at over 3,500 company-operated or franchised properties worldwide.

We also
sell residential real estate in conjunction with luxury hotel development (Ritz-Carlton-Residential) and Timeshare segment projects (Ritz-Carlton Residences and Grand Residences by Marriott-Residential) and receive branding fees for sales of such
branded residential real estate by others. Residences developed in conjunction with hotels are typically constructed and sold by hotel owners with limited amounts, if any, of our capital at risk. We typically open our Timeshare segment residential
projects over time with limited inventory available at any one time. While the worldwide residential market is very large, the luxurious nature of our residential properties, the quality and exclusivity associated with our brands, and the
hospitality services that we provide, all serve to make our residential properties distinctive.

Seasonality

In general, business at company-operated and franchised properties is relatively stable and includes only moderate seasonal fluctuations.
Business at some resort properties may be seasonal depending on location.

Relationship with Major Customer

We operate a number of properties under long-term management agreements that are owned or leased by Host Hotels & Resorts, Inc.
(“Host”). In addition, Host is a partner in several partnerships that own properties operated by us under long-term management agreements. See Footnote No. 23, “Relationship with Major Customer,” of the Notes to our
Financial Statements included in this annual report for more information.

Intellectual Property

We operate in a highly competitive industry and our brand names, trademarks, service marks, trade names, and logos are very important to
the sales and marketing of our properties and services. We believe that our brand names and other intellectual property have come to represent the highest standards of quality, caring, service, and value to our customers and the traveling public.
Accordingly, we register and protect our intellectual property where we deem appropriate and otherwise protect against its unauthorized use.

New Lodging Products

AC Hotels by Marriott.In the fourth quarter of 2010, we signed a definitive agreement to enter into a joint venture with AC Hotels of Spain to create the “AC Hotels by Marriott”
co-brand. We expect that nearly all of the 92 existing AC Hotels in Spain, Italy, and Portugal will transition to the new co-brand sometime during 2011 following the expected first quarter closing on the joint venture. The joint venture will rebrand
those hotels to “AC Hotels by Marriott” once systems integration targeted for mid-2011 is complete, which will allow the hotels to be sold through Marriott channels. AC Hotels by Marriott will focus on the upper moderate price tier and
offer stylish, sleek designs with limited food and beverage. AC Hotels typically contain 50 – 150 rooms and are located in destination, downtown, and suburban markets. Each hotel has it own unique style and character, but feature the signature
“AC Bed” with four large pillows and built-in reading light. Other hotel amenities include a mini-bar, 24-hour room service, laundry service, exclusive bathroom amenities, writing desk, and Wi-Fi. AC Hotels also feature “AC
Fitness” centers with state-of-the-art exercise equipment and the “AC Lounge” where guests can relax and unwind. Small meeting rooms can be found in most hotels to enable guests to have private board meetings or intimate social
gatherings. We expect that the joint venture will increase the number of AC Hotels by Marriott across Europe and in Latin and South America.

Other Activities

We operate 14 system-wide hotel reservation centers, eight in the United States and Canada and six in other countries and territories,
which handle reservation requests for our lodging brands worldwide, including franchised properties. We own one of the U.S. facilities and lease the others.

We focus on increasing value for the consumer and “selling the way the customer wants to buy.” Our Look No
Further®Best Rate Guarantee gives customers access to the same rates whether they book through our telephone

Our reservation system manages and controls inventory availability and pricing set by our hotels and allows us to utilize online and offline agents where cost effective. With over 3,500 properties in our system, economies of scale enable us to
minimize costs per occupied room, drive profits for our owners, and enhance our fee revenue.

With 75 percent of our guests
saying they use our website when planning or booking their stays and with over $6 billion in annual property-level gross revenues,www.Marriott.comis one of the largest online retail sites in the world based on sales. In 2010, we introduced
a number of new enhancements to thewww.Marriott.combooking, mobile, and search engine experience that are designed to generate more revenue and further reduce booking costs.

Marriott’s Sales Transformation is a sales deployment strategy that aligns sales efforts around customer needs, reduces duplication
of sales efforts, and enables coverage for a larger number of accounts. We consider our sales transformation strategy to be a key competitive advantage for Marriott. The rollout of Sales Transformation, which began in late 2007, is scheduled for
completion by mid-2011.







Building on more than 20 years of energy conservation experience, we are
committed to protecting the environment. Our “Spirit to Preserve®” environmental strategy calls for:
greening our $10 billion supply chain; further reducing fuel and water consumption; expanding our portfolio of green hotels and buildings; educating and inspiring employees and guests to support the environment; and investing in innovative,
large-scale conservation projects worldwide.

We are the first in the hospitality industry to launch a green hotel prototype
that has been pre-approved by U.S. Green Building Council (“USGBC”) as part of its Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (“LEED”) Volume program, meaning that any hotel that follows these plans will earn basic LEED
certification, or possibly higher, upon final USGBC approval. The U.S. Travel Association confirms that travelers place the importance of supporting environmentally responsible travel service suppliers as a necessity, even in an economic downturn.

Our Architecture and Construction (“A&C”) division provides design, development, construction, refurbishment,
and procurement services to owners and franchisees of lodging properties on a voluntary basis outside the scope of and separate from our management or franchise contracts. Similar to third-party contractors, A&C provides these services for
owners and franchisees of Marriott-branded properties on a fee basis.

Competition

We encounter strong competition both as a lodging operator and as a franchisor. We believe that by operating a number of hotels among our
brands, we stay in direct touch with customers and react to changes in the marketplace more quickly than chains that rely exclusively on franchising. There are approximately 870 lodging management companies in the United States, including several
that operate more than 100 properties. These operators are primarily private management firms, but also include several large national chains that own and operate their own hotels and also franchise their brands. Our management contracts are
typically long-term in nature, but most allow the hotel owner to replace the management firm if certain financial or performance criteria are not met.

During the recent recession we experienced significant reductions in demand for hotel rooms and timeshare products, particularly in 2009, and we took steps to reduce operating costs and improve
efficiency. Due to the competitive nature of our industry, we focused these efforts on areas that had limited or no impact on the guest experience. While demand trends globally improved in 2010, additional cost reductions could become necessary to
preserve operating margins if demand trends reverse, but we would expect to implement any such efforts in a manner designed to maintain customer loyalty, owner preference, and associate satisfaction, to help maintain or increase our market share.

Affiliation with a national or regional brand is prevalent in the U.S. lodging industry. In 2010, approximately 69 percent of
U.S. hotel rooms were brand-affiliated. Most of the branded properties are franchises, under which the operator pays the franchisor a fee for use of its hotel name and reservation system. The franchising business is concentrated, with the six
largest franchisors operating multiple brands accounting for a significant proportion of all U.S. rooms.

Outside the United
States, branding is much less prevalent and most markets are served primarily by independent operators, although branding is more common for new hotel development. We believe that chain affiliation will increase in overseas markets as local
economies grow, trade barriers are reduced, international travel accelerates and hotel owners seek the economies of centralized reservation systems and marketing programs.

Based on lodging industry data, we have approximately a ten percent share of the U.S. hotel market (based on number of rooms) and we estimate less than a one percent share of the lodging market outside
the United States. We believe that our hotel brands are attractive to hotel owners seeking a management company or franchise affiliation because our hotels typically generate higher occupancies and Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”)
than our direct competitors in most market areas. We attribute this performance premium to our success in achieving and maintaining strong customer preference. We believe that the location and quality of our lodging facilities, our marketing
programs, our reservation systems and our emphasis on guest service and guest and associate satisfaction are contributing factors across all of our brands.

Properties that we operate or franchise are regularly upgraded to maintain their competitiveness. Most of our management agreements provide for the allocation of funds, generally a fixed percentage of
revenue, for periodic renovation of buildings and replacement of furnishings. These ongoing refurbishment programs, along with periodic brand initiatives, are generally adequate to preserve or enhance the competitive position and earning power of
the hotels and timeshare properties. Competitor hotels converting to one of Marriott’s brands typically complete renovations as needed in conjunction with the conversion.







The vacation ownership industry is comprised of a number of highly competitive companies
including several branded hotel companies. Since entering the timeshare industry in 1984, we have become a recognized leader in vacation ownership worldwide. Competition in the timeshare interval, fractional, and residential business is based
primarily on the quality and location of timeshare resorts, trust in the brand, the pricing of product offerings, and the availability of program benefits, such as exchange programs. We believe that our focus on offering distinct vacation
experiences, combined with our financial strength, diverse market presence, strong brands, and well-maintained properties, will enable us to remain competitive. Approximately 74 percent of our timeshare ownership resort sales came from additional
purchases by or referrals from existing owners in 2010, as compared to 65 percent in 2009. The increase in 2010 reflected our customer service, marketing, and sales efforts which initially focused on the existing owner base after the launch of
Marriott Vacation Club Destinations timeshare program in June.

Marriott Rewards and The Ritz-Carlton Rewards are our frequent
guest programs with over 34 million members and 12 participating brands. The rewards programs yield repeat guest business by rewarding frequent stays with points toward free hotel stays and other rewards, or airline miles with any of 30
participating airline programs. We believe that our rewards programs generate substantial repeat business that might otherwise go to competing hotels. In 2010, approximately 50 percent of our room nights were purchased by rewards program members. In
addition, the ability of timeshare owners to convert unused intervals into rewards points enhances the competitive position of our timeshare brands. We continue to enhance our rewards program offerings and specifically and strategically market to
this large and growing customer base. Our loyal rewards member base provides a low cost and high impact vehicle for our revenue generation efforts.

Discontinued Operations

Synthetic Fuel

Prior to 2008, we operated four coal-based synthetic fuel production facilities (the “Facilities”). Because tax credits under
Section 45K of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) were not available for coal-based synthetic fuel produced or sold after calendar year-end 2007, we shut down the Facilities and permanently ceased production of synthetic fuel in
late 2007. Accordingly, we now report this business segment as a discontinued operation. See Footnote No. 3, “Discontinued Operations – Synthetic Fuel,” of the Notes to our Financial Statements for additional information.

Employee Relations

At year-end 2010, we had approximately 129,000 employees, approximately 7,700 of whom were represented by labor unions. We believe relations with our employees are positive.

Environmental Compliance

The properties we operate or develop are subject to national, state and local laws and regulations that govern the discharge of materials
into the environment or otherwise relate to protecting the environment. Those environmental provisions include requirements that address health and safety; the use, management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes; and emission or
discharge of wastes or other materials. We believe that our operation of properties and our development of properties comply, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations. Our compliance with such provisions also has not had a
material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, nor do we anticipate that such compliance will have a material impact in the future.
