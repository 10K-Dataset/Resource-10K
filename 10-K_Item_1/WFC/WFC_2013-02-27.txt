DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS

General

We are a diversified financial services company. We provide retail, commercial
and corporate banking services through banking stores and offices, the internet and other distribution channels to individuals, businesses and institutions in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and in other countries. We provide other financial
services through subsidiaries engaged in various businesses, principally: wholesale banking, mortgage banking, consumer finance, equipment leasing, agricultural finance, commercial finance, securities brokerage and investment banking, insurance
agency and brokerage services, computer and data processing services, trust services, investment advisory services, mortgage-backed securities servicing and venture capital investment.

We have three operating segments for management reporting purposes: Community Banking; Wholesale Banking; and Wealth, Brokerage and
Retirement. The 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders includes financial information and descriptions of these operating segments.

Competition

The financial services
industry is highly competitive. Our subsidiaries compete with financial services providers such as banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, finance companies, mortgage banking companies, insurance companies, investment banks and mutual
fund companies. They also face increased competition from nonbank institutions such as brokerage houses, as well as from financial services subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Many of these competitors enjoy fewer regulatory
constraints and some may have lower cost structures.

Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial
holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. Combinations of this type could significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. The financial services industry is also likely to become more
competitive as further technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services. These technological advances may diminish the importance of depository institutions and other financial intermediaries in the transfer of funds
between parties.


REGULATION AND SUPERVISION

We describe below, and in Notes 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend Restrictions) and 26 (Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders, the
material elements of the regulatory framework applicable to us. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as foreign governments and
financial regulators, and a change in them, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material effect on our business. The regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies is intended to protect depositors,
federal deposit insurance funds, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in bank holding companies such as the Company.

Statutes, regulations and policies could restrict our ability to diversify into other areas of financial services, acquire depository institutions, and pay dividends on our capital stock. They may also
require us to provide financial support to one or more of our subsidiary banks, maintain capital balances in excess of amounts desired by management, and pay higher deposit insurance premiums as a result of a general deterioration in the financial
condition of depository institutions. See the “Risk Factors” section in the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders for additional information.

General

Parent Bank Holding Company.

As a bank holding company, the Parent is
subject to regulation under the BHC Act and to inspection, examination and supervision by its primary regulator, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board or FRB). The Parent is also subject to the disclosure and
regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, both as administered by the SEC. As a company with securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), the Parent is subject
to the rules of the NYSE for listed companies.

Subsidiary Banks.

Our subsidiary national banks, and their subsidiaries, are subject to
regulation and examination primarily by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and also by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the FRB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the SEC and the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission (CFTC). The foreign branches and representative offices of our subsidiary national banks are subject to regulation and examination by their respective foreign financial regulators as well as by the OCC and the FRB. Foreign
subsidiaries of our national bank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the foreign countries in which they conduct business. Our state-chartered bank is subject to primary federal regulation and examination by the FDIC and, in
addition, is regulated and examined by its state banking department.

Nonbank Subsidiaries.

Many of our nonbank subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FRB and
other applicable federal and state agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation by applicable state insurance regulatory agencies, as well as the FRB. Our brokerage subsidiaries are regulated by the SEC, the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and, in some cases, the CFTC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and state securities regulators. Our other nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to the laws and regulations of the federal government and/or the
various states as well as foreign countries in which they conduct business.

Parent Bank Holding Company Activities

“Financial in Nature” Requirement.

We became a financial holding company effective March 13, 2000. We continue to maintain our
status as a bank holding company for purposes of other FRB regulations. As a bank holding company that has elected to become a financial holding company pursuant to the BHC Act, we may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and
engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. “Financial in nature” activities include securities underwriting, dealing and market making; sponsoring
mutual funds and investment companies; insurance underwriting and agency; merchant banking; and activities that the FRB, in consultation with the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial
activity. “Complementary activities” are activities that the FRB determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and do not pose a safety and soundness risk.

FRB approval is not generally required for us to acquire a company (other than a bank holding company, bank or savings association)
engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature, as determined by the FRB. Prior notice to the FRB may be required, however, if the company to be acquired has total consolidated assets of
$10 billion or more. Prior FRB approval is required before we may acquire the beneficial ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of a bank holding company, bank or savings association. In
addition, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) also prohibits our ability to merge, acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or acquire control of another company if our total resulting
consolidated liabilities would exceed 10% of the aggregate consolidated liabilities of all financial companies.

Because we
are a financial holding company, if any of our subsidiary banks receives a rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended (CRA), of less than satisfactory, we will be prohibited, until the rating is raised to satisfactory or better,
from engaging in new activities or acquiring companies other than bank holding companies, banks or savings associations, except that we could engage in new activities, or acquire companies engaged in activities, that are closely related to banking
under the BHC Act. In addition, if the FRB finds that any one of our subsidiary banks is not well capitalized or well managed, we would be required to enter into


an agreement with the FRB to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements and which may contain additional limitations or conditions. Until corrected, we could be prohibited
from engaging in any new activity or acquiring companies engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking under the BHC Act without prior FRB approval. If we fail to correct any such condition within a prescribed period, the FRB could
order us to divest our banking subsidiaries or, in the alternative, to cease engaging in activities other than those closely related to banking under the BHC Act.

Interstate Banking

. Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Act (Riegle-Neal Act), a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state, subject to any state
requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time, not to exceed five years, and the requirement that the bank holding company not control, prior to or following the proposed acquisition, more than 10% of the
total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or, unless the acquisition is the bank holding company’s initial entry into the state, more than 30% of such deposits in the state (or such lesser or greater amount set by
the state). The Riegle-Neal Act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines, thereby creating interstate branches. Banks are also permitted to acquire and to establish new branches in other states.

Regulatory Approval.

In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, federal bank regulators will consider, among other factors,
the effect of the acquisition on competition, financial condition, and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels, the competence, experience, and integrity of management and record of compliance with laws and
regulations, the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, including the acquiring institution’s record of compliance under the CRA, the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the
risk to the stability of the United States banking system.

Dividend Restrictions

The Parent is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiary banks and other subsidiaries. A significant source of funds to pay dividends on
our common and preferred stock and principal and interest on our debt is dividends from the Parent’s subsidiaries. Various federal and state statutory provisions and regulations limit the amount of dividends the Parent’s subsidiary banks
and certain other subsidiaries may pay without regulatory approval. Federal bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Parent’s subsidiary banks from engaging in unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses. The
payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the bank in question, could be deemed an unsafe or unsound practice. The ability of the Parent’s subsidiary banks to pay dividends in the future is currently, and could be further,
influenced by bank regulatory policies and capital guidelines. For information about the restrictions applicable to the Parent’s subsidiary banks, see Note 3 (Cash, Loan and Dividend

Restrictions) to Financial Statements included in the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders.

In addition to these restrictions on the ability of our subsidiary banks to pay dividends to us, the FRB finalized rules in late December 2011 that require large bank holding companies (BHCs), including
Wells Fargo, to submit annual capital plans and to obtain regulatory approval before making capital distributions, such as the payment of dividends. In late 2011 the FRB also proposed additional regulations that could restrict or prohibit our
ability to pay dividends. These rules, which have not been finalized, would impose capital distribution restrictions, including on the payment of dividends, upon the occurrence of capital, stress test, risk management, or liquidity risk management
triggers.

Holding Company Structure

Transfer of Funds from Subsidiary Banks.

The Parent’s subsidiary banks are subject to restrictions under federal law that limit the transfer of funds or other items of value from such
subsidiaries to the Parent and its nonbank subsidiaries (including affiliates) in so-called “covered transactions.” In general, covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, as well as
certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, covered transactions by a subsidiary bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10%
of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus and, with respect to all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate, to 20% of the subsidiary bank’s capital and surplus. Also, loans and extensions of credit to affiliates generally
are required to be secured by qualifying collateral. A bank’s transactions with its nonbank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm’s length terms.

Source of Strength.

The FRB has a policy that a BHC is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to
commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank. This support may be required at times when the BHC may not have the resources to provide the support.

The OCC may order an assessment of the Parent if the capital of one of its national bank subsidiaries were to become impaired. If the Parent failed to pay the assessment within three months, the OCC could
order the sale of the Parent’s stock in the national bank to cover the deficiency.

Depositor Preference.

In the event of the
“liquidation or other resolution” of an insured depository institution, the claims of deposits payable in the United States (including the claims of the FDIC as subrogee of insured depositors) and certain claims for administrative expenses
of the FDIC as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution. If an insured depository institution fails, claims of insured and uninsured U.S. depositors, along with claims of the FDIC, will have priority
in payment ahead of unsecured creditors, including the Parent, and depositors whose deposits


are solely payable at such insured depository institution’s non-U.S. offices.

Liability of Commonly Controlled Institutions.

All of the Company’s subsidiary banks are insured by the FDIC. FDIC-insured depository
institutions can be held liable for any loss incurred, or reasonably expected to be incurred, by the FDIC due to the default of an FDIC-insured depository institution controlled by the same bank holding company, and for any assistance provided by
the FDIC to an FDIC-insured depository institution that is in danger of default and that is controlled by the same bank holding company. “Default” means generally the appointment of a conservator or receiver. “In danger of
default” means generally the existence of certain conditions indicating that a default is likely to occur in the absence of regulatory assistance.

Dodd-Frank Act

The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted on July 21, 2010, will result in broad
changes to the U.S. financial system and is the most significant financial reform legislation since the 1930s. Financial regulatory agencies have issued numerous rulemakings to implement its provisions, but a number of rulemakings required by the
Dodd-Frank Act have either not yet been proposed or have not been finalized. As a result, the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act is not yet known, but it has affected, and we expect it will continue to affect most of our businesses in some way,
either directly through regulation of specific activities or indirectly through regulation of concentration risks, capital or liquidity. At the enterprise level, the FRB published proposed rules in December 2011 to implement the provisions of the
Dodd-Frank Act regarding enhanced supervision and regulation of large BHCs like Wells Fargo and other systemically significant firms. The proposed rules included new risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits, liquidity requirements,
counterparty credit exposure limits, risk management requirements, stress testing requirements, debt-to-equity requirements, and early remediation requirements. In October 2012, the FRB issued final rules regarding stress testing requirements, which
became effective on November 15, 2012. The OCC issued and finalized similar rules during 2012 for stress testing of large national banks. These stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities large BHCs and banks
must undertake as well as rules governing testing controls, oversight and disclosure requirements. Until the remaining provisions of the December 2011 FRB proposal are finalized, we are unable to fully estimate their impact on the Company, but we
expect the final rules will significantly increase our compliance and regulatory requirements.

In addition to requiring
rules for the enhanced supervision and regulation of large BHCs and other systemically significant firms, the Dodd-Frank Act also requires the FDIC and FRB to implement rules requiring large BHCs like Wells Fargo to prepare and submit resolution
plans, known as “living wills,” to facilitate the rapid and orderly resolution of the Company in the event of material distress or its failure. Under the rules implemented by the FDIC and FRB in this regard, Wells Fargo is

required to submit its resolution plan to the FDIC and FRB on or before July 1, 2013. This date is also the deadline for the submission of a resolution plan for our principal banking
subsidiary, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (WFBNA). Pursuant to its general rulemaking authority, the FDIC also requires large banks, like WFBNA, to prepare resolution plans.

Federal regulatory agencies issued numerous other rulemakings in 2011 and 2012 to implement various other requirements of the Dodd-Frank
Act, but many of these other proposed rules remain open for comment. Agencies have proposed rules establishing a comprehensive framework for the regulation of derivatives, restricting banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading or owning
interests in or sponsoring hedge funds or private equity funds (the Volcker Rule), and requiring sponsors of asset-backed securities (ABS) to retain an ownership stake in the ABS. In November 2012, the Financial Stability Oversight Council proposed
new regulations for addressing perceived risks that money market mutual funds may pose to the financial stability of the United States. Once final recommendations are issued, the SEC is required to adopt the recommendations or explain its reasons
for not implementing the recommendations. Although we have analyzed these and other proposed rules, the absence of final rules and the complexity of some of the proposed rules make it difficult for the Company to estimate the financial, compliance
or operational impacts of the proposals.

The Dodd-Frank Act also established the CFPB to ensure consumers receive clear and
accurate disclosures regarding financial products and to protect consumers from hidden fees and unfair or abusive practices. The CFPB, which has now been in operation for over a year, has begun exercising supervisory review of banks under its
jurisdiction and has concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage-related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan
originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages. Several of the CFPB’s rulemakings were issued in January 2013, and we continue to analyze their
requirements to determine the impact of the rules to our businesses. During 2013, we expect the CFPB to focus its rulemaking efforts on integrating disclosure requirements for lenders and settlement agents and expanding the scope of information
lenders must report in connection with mortgage and other housing-related loan applications. In addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority, the CFPB is continuing its on-going examination activities with respect to a number of consumer
businesses and products.

Capital Requirements

We are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, which are substantially similar to those imposed by the OCC and the FDIC on depository institutions within their
jurisdictions. Under these guidelines, a depository institution’s or a holding company’s assets and certain specified off-balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories. Tier 1 capital is considered core
capital


and generally includes common stockholders’ equity, qualifying preferred stock, and trust preferred securities, and noncontrolling interests in consolidated subsidiaries, reduced by
goodwill, net of related taxes, certain intangible and other assets in excess of prescribed limitations, and adjusted for the aggregate impact of certain items included in other comprehensive income. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital,
subordinated debt and other components that do not qualify for Tier 1 capital, and the aggregate allowance for credit losses up to a specified percentage of risk-weighted assets. In addition to measures of Tier 1 and Total capital, an additional
measure of capital, Tier 1 common equity, reflects common equity and retained earnings, less goodwill and certain other deductions.

National banks and bank holding companies currently are required to maintain Tier 1 and Total capital equal to at least 4% and 8%, respectively, of their total risk-weighted assets (including certain
off-balance sheet items, such as standby letters of credit). The risk-based capital rules state that the capital requirements are minimum standards based primarily on broad credit-risk considerations and do not take into account the other types of
risk a banking organization may be exposed to (e.g., interest rate, market, liquidity and operational risks). The FRB may, therefore, set higher capital requirements for categories of banks (e.g. systematically important firms), or for an individual
bank as situations warrant. For example, holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels, without significant reliance on
intangible assets. For these reasons, we are expected to operate with a capital position well above the minimum ratios, with the amount of capital held to be determined by us through an internal capital assessment that corresponds to our broad risk
exposure.

The regulatory capital rules state that voting common stockholders’ equity should be the dominant element
within Tier 1 capital and that banking organizations should avoid overreliance on non-common equity elements. During 2009, in conjunction with the FRB’s SCAP stress test process, the ratio of Tier 1 common equity to risk-weighted assets became
significant as a measurement of the predominance of common equity in Tier 1 capital. There is currently no mandated minimum ratio.

In June 2004, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision (BCBS) published new international guidelines for determining regulatory capital that were designed to be more risk sensitive and to promote enhanced
risk management practices among large, internationally active banking organizations. The United States federal bank regulatory agencies each approved a final rule similar to the international guidelines in November 2007. This advanced capital
adequacy framework is known as “Basel II,” and is intended to more closely align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks. Basel II incorporates three pillars that address (a) capital adequacy, (b) supervisory review,
which relates to the computation of capital and internal assessment processes, and (c) market discipline, through increased disclosure requirements. Embodied within these pillars are aspects of risk strategy, measurement and management that
relate to credit risk, market risk, and operational risk. Banking organizations are required to enhance the measurement and

management of those risks through the use of advanced approaches for calculating risk-based capital requirements. Basel II includes safeguards that include a requirement that banking
organizations conduct a parallel run over a period of four consecutive calendar quarters for measuring regulatory capital under the new regulatory capital rules and the existing general risk-based capital rules before solely operating under the
Basel II framework; a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under Basel II without floors; and a commitment by the federal bank regulatory agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of
the framework to ensure Basel II is working as intended. However, the federal bank regulators adopted a final rule in 2011 to replace the transitional floors in the advanced approaches with a permanent capital floor equal to the risk-based capital
requirements under the Basel I capital adequacy guidelines. Wells Fargo is implementing the advanced approaches under Basel II, and entered the parallel run in July 2012 with regulatory approval.

In addition, the federal bank regulatory agencies have established minimum leverage (Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets)
guidelines for banks within their regulatory jurisdiction. These guidelines provide for a minimum leverage ratio of 3% for banks that meet certain specified criteria, including excellent asset quality, high liquidity, low interest rate exposure and
the highest regulatory rating. Institutions not meeting these criteria are required to maintain a leverage ratio of 4%. Our Tier 1 and total risk-based capital ratios and leverage ratio as of December 31, 2012, are included in Note 26
(Regulatory and Agency Capital Requirements) to Financial Statements included in the 2012 Annual Report to Stockholders. At December 31, 2012, the Company and each of its subsidiary banks were “well capitalized” under the
applicable regulatory capital adequacy guidelines.

In December 2010, the BCBS finalized a set of international guidelines
for determining regulatory capital known as “Basel III.” These guidelines were developed in response to the financial crisis of 2008 and 2009 and were intended to address many of the weaknesses identified in the banking sector as
contributing to the crisis including excessive leverage, inadequate and low quality capital and insufficient liquidity buffers. The Basel III guidelines would:

•

raise the quality of capital for banks to be better able to absorb losses on both a going concern and gone concern basis;

•

increase the risk coverage of the capital framework, specifically for trading activities, securitizations, exposures to off-balance sheet vehicles, and
counterparty credit exposures arising from derivatives;

•

raise the level of minimum capital requirements;

•

establish an international leverage ratio;

•

develop capital buffers; and

•

raise standards for the supervisory review process (Pillar 2) and public disclosures (Pillar 3).

The BCBS has also proposed additional Tier 1 common equity surcharge requirements for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs). The
surcharge ranges from 1.0% to 3.5% of risk-


weighted assets depending on the bank’s systemic importance, which is determined under an indicator-based approach that would consider five broad categories: cross-jurisdictional activity,
size, inter-connectedness, substitutability/financial institution infrastructure and complexity. These additional capital requirements for G-SIBs, which would be phased in beginning in January 2016 and become fully effective on January 1, 2019,
would be in addition to the minimum Basel III 7.0% Tier 1 common equity requirement finalized in December 2010. The Financial Stability Board (FSB), in an updated list published in November 2012 based on year-end 2011 data, identified the Company as
one of the 28 G-SIBS and provisionally determined that the Company’s surcharge would be 1.0%. The FSB may revise the list of G-SIBs and their required surcharges prior to implementation based on additional or future data.

U.S. regulatory authorities have been considering the BCBS capital guidelines and proposals, and in June 2012, the U.S. banking
regulators jointly issued three notices of proposed rulemaking that are essentially intended to implement the BCBS capital guidelines for U.S. banks. Together these notices of proposed rulemaking would, among other things:

•

implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms including those that revise the definition of capital, increase minimum capital
ratios, and introduce a minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio of 4.5% and a capital conservation buffer of 2.5% (for a total minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio of 7.0%) and a potential countercyclical buffer of up to 2.5%, which would be imposed by
regulators at their discretion if it is determined that a period of excessive credit growth is contributing to an increase in systemic risk;

•

revise “Basel I” rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity;

•

modify the existing Basel II advanced approaches rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to implement Basel III; and

•

comply with the Dodd-Frank Act provision prohibiting the reliance on external credit ratings.

Although the proposals contemplated an effective date of January 1, 2013, with phased in compliance requirements, the rules have
not yet been finalized by the U.S. banking regulators due to the volume of comments received and concerns expressed during the comment period. The notices of proposed rulemaking did not address the BCBS capital surcharge proposals for G-SIBs or the
proposed Basel III liquidity standards. U.S. regulatory authorities have indicated that these proposals will be addressed at a later date. The U.S. banking regulators have approved a final rule to implement changes to the market risk capital rule,
which requires banking organizations with significant trading activities to adjust their capital requirements to better account for the market risks of those activities.

Although uncertainty exists regarding final capital rules, we evaluate the impact of Basel III on our capital ratios based on our interpretation of the proposed capital requirements, and we estimate that
our Tier 1 common equity ratio under the Basel III proposals exceeded the fully phased-in minimum of 7.0% by 119 basis points at December 31, 2012. The proposed Basel III

capital rules and interpretations and assumptions used in estimating our Basel III calculations are subject to change depending on final promulgation of Basel III capital rulemaking.

From time to time, the FRB and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) propose changes and amendments to, and
issue interpretations of, risk-based capital guidelines and related reporting instructions. In addition, the FRB has closely monitored capital levels of the institutions it supervises during the ongoing financial disruption, and may require such
institutions to modify capital levels based on FRB determinations. Such determinations, proposals or interpretations could, if implemented in the future, affect our reported capital ratios and net risk-adjusted assets.

As an additional means to identify problems in the financial management of depository institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act
(FDI Act) requires federal bank regulatory agencies to establish certain non-capital safety and soundness standards for institutions for which they are the primary federal regulator. The standards relate generally to operations and management, asset
quality, interest rate exposure, executive compensation and risk management. The agencies are authorized to take action against institutions that fail to meet such standards.

The FDI Act requires federal bank regulatory agencies to take “prompt corrective action” with respect to FDIC-insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. A
depository institution’s treatment for purposes of the prompt corrective action provisions will depend upon how its capital levels compare to various capital measures and certain other factors, as established by regulation.

Capital Planning

In late 2011, the FRB
finalized rules to require large BHCs to submit capital plans annually for review to determine if the FRB had any objections before making any capital distributions. The rule requires updates to capital plans in the event of material changes in a
BHC’s risk profile, including as a result of any significant acquisitions.

On March 13, 2012, the FRB notified us
that it did not object to our 2012 capital plan included in the 2012 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). Since the FRB notification, the Company took several capital actions during 2012, including increasing its quarterly common stock
dividend rate to $0.22 per share, completing the redemption of $2.7 billion of trust preferred securities that will no longer count as Tier 1 capital under the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposed Basel III capital standards, repurchasing shares of
our common stock, and purchasing an aggregate of $2.2 billion of our subordinated debt with an effective yield of 2.02% in tender offers for such securities. In first quarter 2013, the Company increased its dividend to $0.25 per share and submitted
for redemption an additional $2.8 billion of trust preferred securities. Each of these actions was contemplated by the capital plan included in the 2012 CCAR.

Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, our 2013 CCAR included a comprehensive capital plan supported by an assessment of expected uses and sources of capital over a given planning


horizon under a range of expected and stress scenarios, similar to the process the FRB used to conduct a CCAR in 2012. As part of the 2013 CCAR, the FRB also generated a supervisory stress test
driven by a sharp decline in the economy and significant decline in asset pricing using the information provided by the Company to estimate performance. The FRB is expected to review the supervisory stress results both as required under the
Dodd-Frank Act using a common set of capital actions for all large BHCs and by taking into account the Company’s proposed capital actions. We submitted our board approved 2013 capital plan to the FRB on January 4, 2013. The FRB has
indicated that it will publish its supervisory stress test results as required under the Dodd-Frank Act on March 7, 2013, and the related CCAR results, taking into account the Company’s proposed capital actions, on March 14, 2013.

Deposit Insurance Assessments

Our bank subsidiaries, including Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., are members of the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) maintained by the FDIC. Through the DIF, the FDIC insures the deposits of our banks up to
prescribed limits for each depositor. The DIF was formed March 31, 2006, upon the merger of the Bank Insurance Fund and the Savings Insurance Fund in accordance with the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 (the FDIR Act). The FDIR Act
established a range of 1.15% to 1.50% within which the FDIC Board of Directors may set the Designated Reserve Ratio (reserve ratio or DRR). The FDIR Act also granted the FDIC Board the discretion to price deposit insurance according to risk for all
insured institutions regardless of the level of the reserve ratio.

The Dodd-Frank Act gave the FDIC greater discretion to
manage the DIF, raised the minimum DRR to 1.35% and removed the upper limit of the range. In October 2010, the FDIC Board adopted a Restoration Plan to ensure that the DIF reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the
Dodd-Frank Act. At the same time, the FDIC Board proposed a comprehensive, long-range plan for DIF management. In December 2010, as part of the comprehensive plan, the FDIC Board adopted a final rule to set the DRR at 2%, and in February 2011,
the FDIC Board approved the remainder of the comprehensive plan. The Restoration Plan eliminated a 3 basis point increase in the annual assessment rates that was to take effect January 1, 2011.

In 2009, the FDIC undertook several measures in an effort to replenish the DIF. On February 27, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final
rule modifying the risk-based assessment system and set new initial base assessment rates beginning April 1, 2009. Rates ranged from a minimum of 12 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for well-managed, well-capitalized institutions with the
highest credit ratings, to 45 cents per $100 for those institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. Risk-based adjustments to the initial assessment rate could have lowered the rate to 7 cents per $100 of domestic deposits for well-managed,
well-capitalized banks with the highest credit ratings or raised the rate to 77.5 cents per $100 for depository institutions posing the most risk to the DIF. On May 22, 2009, the FDIC adopted a final rule imposing a 5 basis point special
assessment on each insured

depository institution’s assets minus Tier 1 capital as of June 30, 2009. The amount of the special assessment for any institution was limited to 10 basis points times the
institution’s assessment base for the second quarter 2009. On November 17, 2009, the FDIC amended its regulations to require insured institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly risk-based assessments for fourth quarter 2009, and
all of 2010, 2011, and 2012. For purposes of determining the prepayment, the FDIC used the institution’s assessment rate in effect on September 30, 2009. The combined prepayment amount for our banking subsidiaries was $3.9 billion. Any
unused prepaid assessment will be refunded on June 28, 2013.

On February 7, 2011, the FDIC Board approved a final
rule on assessments, dividends, assessment base and large bank pricing that took effect on April 1, 2011. To maintain the DIF, member institutions are assessed an insurance premium based on an assessment base and an assessment rate. Generally,
the assessment base is an institution’s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. For large and highly complex institutions (those that are very large and are structurally and operationally complex or that pose unique
challenges and risks in the case of failure), the assessment rate is determined by combining supervisory ratings and certain financial measures into scorecards. The score received by an institution will be converted into an assessment rate for the
institution. The FDIC retains the ability to adjust the total score of large and highly complex institutions based upon quantitative or qualitative measures not adequately captured in the scorecards.

All FDIC-insured depository institutions must also pay a quarterly assessment towards interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing
Corporation, a federal corporation chartered under the authority of the Federal Housing Finance Board. The bonds (commonly referred to as FICO bonds) were issued to capitalize the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. FDIC-insured
depository institutions paid approximately 1.00 to 1.02 cents per $100 of assessable deposits during the first nine months of 2011. To coincide with Dodd-Frank Act mandated changes to the insurance assessment base, the FDIC established lower FICO
assessment rates, 0.66 cents per $100 of assessment base for 2012 and 0.64 cents per $100 of assessment base for first quarter 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2012, the Company’s FDIC deposit insurance assessments, including FICO
assessments, totaled $1.4 billion.

The FDIC may terminate a depository institution’s deposit insurance upon a finding
that the institution’s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule, regulation, order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution’s
regulatory agency. The termination of deposit insurance for one or more of our bank subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending on the collective size of the particular banks involved.

Fiscal and Monetary Policies

Our
business and earnings are affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government and its agencies.


We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in
the United States. Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the FRB are (a) conducting open market operations in United States government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions,
(c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates. These methods are used in varying
degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The policies of the FRB may have a material effect on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

Privacy Provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Restrictions on Cross-Selling

Federal banking regulators, as required under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the GLB Act), have adopted rules limiting the ability of banks and other
financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. The rules require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain
personal information to nonaffiliated third parties. The privacy provisions of the GLB Act affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial services companies and conveyed to outside vendors. Federal financial regulators
have issued regulations under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act that have the effect of increasing the length of the waiting period, after privacy disclosures are provided to new customers, before information can be shared among
different affiliated companies for the purpose of cross-selling products and services between those affiliated companies.

Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) implemented a broad range of corporate governance and accounting measures to
increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies, and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of disclosures under federal securities
laws. We are subject to Sarbanes-Oxley because we are required to file periodic reports with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Among other things, Sarbanes-Oxley and/or its implementing regulations established membership
requirements and additional responsibilities for our audit committee, imposed restrictions on the relationship between us and our outside auditors (including restrictions on the types of non-audit services our auditors may provide to us), imposed
additional responsibilities for our external financial statements on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, expanded the disclosure requirements for our corporate insiders, required our management to evaluate our disclosure
controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and required our independent registered public accounting firm to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting.

Patriot Act

The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (Patriot Act) is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement
agencies and intelligence communities to work together to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Patriot Act has significant implications for depository institutions, brokers, dealers and other businesses involved in the transfer of money. The
Patriot Act required us to implement new or revised policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activities, and currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The Patriot Act also requires
federal bank regulators to evaluate the effectiveness of an applicant in combating money laundering in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition.

Future Legislation or Regulation

In light of recent conditions in the U.S. and global
financial markets and the U.S. and global economy, legislators, the presidential administration and regulators have continued their increased focus on regulation of the financial services industry. Proposals that further increase regulation of the
financial services industry have been and are expected to continue to be introduced in the U.S. Congress, in state legislatures and abroad. In addition, not all regulations authorized or required under the Dodd-Frank Act have been proposed or
finalized by federal regulators. Further legislative changes and additional regulations may change our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such legislation and regulations could increase our cost of doing business, affect
our compensation structure, restrict or expand the activities in which we may engage or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether future legislative
proposals will be enacted and, if enacted, the effect that they, or any implementing regulations, would have on our business, results of operations or financial condition. The same uncertainty exists with respect to regulations authorized or
required under the Dodd-Frank Act but that have not yet been proposed or finalized.
