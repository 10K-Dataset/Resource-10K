ITEM 1.Business



OVERVIEW





We are a global leader in the design, development, manufacture
    and marketing of orthopaedic reconstructive implants, dental
    implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical
    products. We also provide other healthcare related services. In
    this report, “Zimmer,” “we,” “us,”
    “our” and similar words refer collectively to Zimmer
    Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Zimmer Holdings refers to
    the parent company only.



Zimmer Holdings was incorporated in Delaware in 2001. Our
    history dates to 1927, when Zimmer Manufacturing Company, a
    predecessor, was founded in Warsaw, Indiana. On August 6,
    2001, Zimmer Holdings was spun off from its former parent and
    became an independent public company.



CUSTOMERS, SALES
    AND MARKETING





Our primary customers include orthopaedic surgeons,
    neurosurgeons, oral surgeons, dentists, hospitals, stocking
    distributors, healthcare dealers and, in their capacity as
    agents, healthcare purchasing organizations or buying groups.
    These customers range from large multinational enterprises to
    independent surgeons.



We have operations in more than 25 countries and market products
    in more than 100 countries, with corporate headquarters in
    Warsaw, Indiana, and more than 100 manufacturing, distribution
    and warehousingand/oroffice facilities worldwide. We manage our operations through
    three major geographic segments — the Americas, which
    is comprised principally of the United States and includes other
    North, Central and South American markets; Europe, which is
    comprised principally of Europe and includes the Middle East and
    Africa; and Asia Pacific, which is comprised primarily of Japan
    and Australia and includes other Asian and Pacific markets.



We market and sell products through three principal channels:
    1) direct to healthcare institutions, such as hospitals or
    direct channel accounts; 2) through stocking distributors
    and healthcare dealers; and 3) directly to dental practices
    and dental laboratories. With direct channel accounts, inventory
    is generally consigned to sales agents or customers. With sales
    to stocking distributors, healthcare dealers, dental practices
    and dental laboratories, title to product passes generally upon
    shipment. Direct channel accounts represented approximately
    80 percent of our net sales in 2009. No individual direct
    channel account, stocking distributor, healthcare dealer, dental
    practice or dental laboratory accounted for more than
    1 percent of our net sales for 2009.



We stock inventory in our warehouse facilities and retain title
    to consigned inventory in sufficient quantities so that products
    are available when needed for surgical procedures. Safety stock
    levels are determined based on a number of factors, including
    demand, manufacturing lead times and quantities required to
    maintain service levels. We also carry trade accounts receivable
    balances based on credit terms that are generally consistent
    with local market practices.



We utilize a network of sales associates, sales managers and
    support personnel, most of whom are employed or contracted by
    independent distributors and sales agencies. We invest a
    significant amount of time and expense in training sales
    associates in how to use specific products and how to best
    inform surgeons of product features and uses. Sales force
    representatives must have strong technical selling skills and
    medical education to provide technical support for surgeons.



In response to the different healthcare systems throughout the
    world, our sales and marketing strategies and organizational
    structures differ by region. We utilize a global approach to
    sales force training, marketing and medical education to provide
    consistent, high quality service. Additionally, we keep current
    with key surgical developments and other issues related to
    orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, dentists and oral surgeons
    and the medical procedures they perform.



Americas.The Americas is our largest
    geographic segment, accounting for $2,372.4 million, or
    58 percent, of 2009 net sales, with the United States
    accounting for 94 percent of net sales in this region. The
    United States sales force primarily consists of independent
    sales agents, most of whom sell products exclusively for Zimmer.
    Sales agents in the United States receive a commission on
    product sales and are responsible for many operating decisions
    and costs. Sales commissions are accrued at the time of sale.



In this region, we contract with group purchasing organizations
    and managed care accounts and have promoted unit growth by
    offering volume discounts to customer healthcare institutions
    within a specified group. Generally, we are designated as one of
    several preferred purchasing sources for specified products,
    although members are not obligated to purchase our products.
    Contracts with group purchasing organizations generally have a
    term of three years with extensions as warranted.



A majority of hospitals in the United States belong to at least
    one group purchasing organization. In 2009, individual hospital
    orders purchased through contractual arrangements with our two
    largest group purchasing organizations accounted for
    approximately 34 percent of our net sales in the United
    States. Contractual sales were highest through Novation, LLC and
    Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. No individual end-user,
    however, accounted for over 1 percent of our net sales, and
    the top ten end-users accounted for approximately 4 percent
    of our aggregate net sales in the United States.



In the Americas, we monitor and rank independent sales agents
    across a range of performance metrics including the achievement
    of certain sales targets and maintenance of efficient levels of
    working capital.

Europe.The European geographic segment
    accounted for $1,119.2 million, or 27 percent, of
    2009 net sales, with France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
    Switzerland and the United Kingdom collectively accounting for
    over 75 percent of net sales in the region. This segment
    also includes other key markets, including Benelux, Nordic,
    Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Our
    sales force in this region is comprised of direct sales
    associates, commissioned agents, independent distributors and
    sales support personnel. In Europe, we emphasize the advantages
    of our clinically proven, established designs and innovative
    solutions, such as minimally invasive surgical procedures and
    technologies and new and enhanced materials and surfaces.



Asia Pacific.The Asia Pacific geographic
    segment accounted for $603.8 million, or 15 percent,
    of 2009 net sales, with Japan being the largest market
    within this segment, accounting for approximately
    58 percent of the region’s sales. This segment also
    includes key markets such as Australia, New Zealand, Korea,
    China, Taiwan, India, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong and
    Malaysia. In Japan and most countries in the Asia Pacific
    region, we maintain a network of dealers, who act as order
    agents on behalf of hospitals in the region, and sales
    associates, who build and maintain relationships with
    orthopaedic surgeons, neurosurgeons and dental surgeons in their
    markets. These sales associates cover over 7,000 hospitals in
    the region. The knowledge and skills of our sales associates
    play a critical role in providing service, product information
    and support to surgeons.



SEASONALITY





Our business is somewhat seasonal in nature, as many of our
    products are used in elective procedures, which typically
    decline during the summer months and holiday seasons.



DISTRIBUTION





We operate distribution facilities domestically in Warsaw,
    Indiana; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Memphis,
    Tennessee; Carlsbad, California; and Austin, Texas and
    internationally, in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, the
    Czech Republic, China, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong,
    India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, the Netherlands, New
    Zealand, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Spain,
    Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand and the United Kingdom. In
    2009, we completed construction of our highly automated,state-of-the-artdistribution facility in Eschbach, Germany. This new facility
    supports direct to customer, country and dealer shipments for
    the European region and global shipments for products sourced
    from certain European-based supply chain sites.



We generally ship our orders via expedited courier. We do not
    consider our backlog of firm orders to be material to an
    understanding of our business.



PRODUCTS





Our products include orthopaedic reconstructive implants, dental
    implants, spinal implants, trauma products and related surgical
    products.



We utilize our exclusiveTrabecular
    MetaltmTechnology across various product categories.Trabecular
    Metalmaterial is a structural biomaterial with a cellular
    architecture that resembles bone and approximates its physical
    and mechanical properties more closely than other prosthetic
    materials. The highly porous trabecular configuration is
    conducive to more normal bone formation and bone in-growth.Trabecular Metalimplants are fabricated using elemental
    tantalum metal and a patented vapor deposition technique that
    creates a metallic strut configuration resembling cancellous
    bone with nano-textured surface features.



Orthopaedic
    Reconstructive Implants



Knee
    Implants





Total knee replacement surgeries typically include a femoral
    component, a patella (knee cap), a tibial tray and an articular
    surface (placed on the tibial tray). Knee replacement surgeries
    include first-time, or primary, joint replacement procedures and
    revision procedures for the replacement, repair or enhancement
    of an implant or component from a previous procedure. Knee
    implants are designed to accommodate different levels of
    ligament stabilization of the joint. While some knee implant
    designs, called cruciate retaining (CR) designs, require the
    retention of the posterior cruciate ligament, other designs,
    called posterior stabilized (PS) and ultracongruent (UC)
    designs, provide joint stability without the posterior cruciate
    ligament. There are also procedures for partial reconstruction
    of the knee, which treat limited knee degeneration and involve
    the replacement of only one side, or compartment, of the knee
    with a unicompartmental knee prosthesis.



Our portfolio ofMinimally Invasive
    SolutionstmProcedures (MIS) includes the MIS Mini-Incision Total Knee
    Procedure. The MIS Mini-Incision Procedure utilizes specialized
    MIS Instruments which feature smaller, ergonomic and highly
    precise instruments which accommodate and facilitate a smaller
    incision and less disruption of the surrounding soft tissues.



We offer a wide range of products for specialized knee
    procedures, including the following:



NexGen®Complete Knee Solution.  The number one selling knee
    brand in the world, theNexGenKnee product line is a
    comprehensive system for knee replacement surgery which has
    significant application across the continuum of care in all
    things related to primary and revision knee arthroplasty,
    including CR, PS and revision procedures. TheNexGenKnee
    System offers joint stability, sizing and performance options
    that can be tailored to individual patient needs while providing
    surgeons with a unified system of interchangeable components.
    TheNexGenKnee System provides surgeons with complete
    and versatile knee instrument options spanning multiple surgeon
    and treatment













ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.2009FORM 10-KANNUAL REPORT



philosophies, including soft tissue balancing and measured
    resection MIS Mini-Incision Instruments, and multiple
    traditional instrument systems. The breadth and versatility of
    theNexGenKnee System allows surgeons to transition from
    one type of implant to another during surgery, according to the
    respective needs of the patient, and to support current surgical
    philosophies.



TheNexGenCR product line is designed to be used in
    conjunction with a functioning posterior cruciate ligament.
    Similar to the posterior stabilized design, theNexGenCR-FlexFixed Bearing Knee is designed to provide a greater range of
    motion for patients who require deep bending in their activities
    of daily living. TheNexGenCR-Flex Femoral Components
    offer a tissue balancing (flexion balancing) solution which
    allows the surgeon to adjust component sizing and balance and
    stabilize the implant without removing additional bone or
    wasting critical procedure time.



TheNexGenComplete Knee SolutionLegacy®Knee-Posterior Stabilized product line provides stability in the
    absence of the posterior cruciate ligament. The PS capabilities
    can be augmented via the use of aNexGen LegacyPosterior
    Stabilized Flex Knee (LPS-Flex Knee), a high-flexion implant
    that has the potential to accommodate knee flexion up to155-degreesrange of motion for patients whose lifestyle and body type
    demand and can accommodate this performance standard. With the
    2008 rollout of theNexGenLPS-Flex Mobile Knee in the
    U.S., we are now one of only two companies that can offer a
    mobile-bearing total knee treatment option in the
    U.S. market for surgeons and patients that may be best
    suited for this high performance implant design.



NexGenKneeGender
    Solutionstmfemorals represent the first knee implants specifically shaped
    to offer fit and function optimized for the unique anatomical
    considerations more commonly seen in female patients. Gender
    implants are an important strategic focus, as more than half of
    total knee arthroplasty patients are female.Gender Solutionsfemorals are available in bothNexGenCR-Flexand LPS-Flex configurations. The concept of advancing implant
    design through customization based on anatomy or other patient
    characteristics has manifested in rapidly expanding gender
    technologies across the continuum of our products and into other
    important brands in our growing portfolio.



TheNexGenRevision Knee product line consists of several
    different products that are designed to provide clinical
    solutions to surgeons for various revision situations, including
    multiple constraint levels for ligament and soft tissue
    inefficiencies and a bone augmentation implant system made from
    ourTrabecular MetalTechnology material. These augments
    are designed to address significant bone loss in revision
    surgery while allowing natural bone to reconstruct within the
    implant construct.



We offer improved polyethylene performance in theNexGenKnee System with our conventional polyethylene andProlong®Highly Crosslinked Polyethylene, which offers reduced wear
    and resistance to oxidation, pitting and cracking.ProlongHighly Crosslinked Polyethylene is available in designs
    compatible with bothNexGenCR-Flex andLPS-Flexfemoral components.



Natural-Knee®II System.  TheNatural-KneeII System
    consists of a range of interchangeable, anatomically designed
    implants which include a proprietaryCancellous-Structured
    Titaniumtm(CSTitm)

    Porous Coating option for stable fixation in active patients.



Gender Solutions Natural-KneeFlex System.  TheGender Solutions Natural-KneeFlex System adds our High
    Flex andGender Solutionsdesign concepts to theNatural-KneeSystem. TheGender Solutions Natural-KneeFlex System recognizes that two distinct populations exist
    in total knee arthroplasty (female and male) and offers two
    distinct implant shapes for enhanced fit. The system is
    compatible with muscle sparing MIS procedures and accommodates
    high flexion capacity up to 155 degrees. The system features the
    proven clinical success of our asymmetric tibial plate,CSTiporous coating,ProlongHighly Crosslinked
    Polyethylene and the ultracongruent articular surface.



Innex®Total Knee System.  TheInnexKnee System
    offers fixed bearing and mobile bearing knee components all
    designed within the same system philosophy. While theInnexKnee System is best known for its mobile bearing knee
    offering, the availability of differing levels of articular
    constraint, theInnexRevision Knee andInnex Gender
    Solutionscomponents make this offering a comprehensive
    mobile and fixed bearing knee system. TheInnexKnee
    System is distributed in Europe and Asia Pacific and is not
    currently available for commercial distribution in the United
    States.



ZimmerUnicompartmental Knee Systems.  TheZimmer®Unicompartmental Knee System offers a high flexion design
    for unicompartmental knee surgery. This high flex product was
    designed specifically for MIS Procedures and Technologies. The
    system offers the surgeon the ability to conserve bone by
    replacing only the compartment of the knee that has had
    degenerative changes. AGender SolutionsPatello-Femoral
    Joint System is also available which incorporates key gender
    specific design features and a proprietary guided milling
    surgical technique for use in patello-femoral joint replacement.



ZimmerPatient Specific Instruments.  In late
    2009, a 510(k) Application for theZimmerPatient
    Specific Instruments was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
    Administration (FDA). TheZimmerPatient Specific
    Instruments simplify a total knee procedure and help enhance
    appropriate placement of the final implant based on a
    surgeon’s preoperative surgical plan. Based on a
    patient’s MRI scan, a computer generated, custom guide is
    produced to conform to a patient’s unique knee anatomy.
    This guide is then utilized intraoperatively to aid in the
    surgical correction of the patient’s knee.

Zimmer Segmental System.Adding to our broad
    portfolio of revision options, theZimmerSegmental
    System is a comprehensive system designed to address patients
    with severe bone loss associated with disease, trauma or
    revision. This important addition realizes our strategic goal of
    expanding our product solutions across the continuum of care
    and, with the incorporation ofTrabecular MetalTechnology, expands the possibilities for treatment, short
    and long term fixation and stability.



Hip
    Implants





Total hip replacement surgeries replace both the head of the
    femur and the socket portion of the pelvis (acetabulum) of the
    natural hip. Hip procedures include first time, or primary,
    joint replacement as well as revision procedures. Approximately
    30 percent of hip implant procedures involve the use of
    bone cement to attach or affix the prosthetic components to the
    surrounding bone. The remaining are press-fit into bone, which
    means that they have a surface that bone affixes to through
    either ongrowth or ingrowth technologies.



Our portfolio of MIS Techniques includes theZimmerMIS
    Anterior Supine Technique, the MIS Posterior Procedure, theZimmerMIS Anterolateral Technique and MIS2-IncisiontmHip Replacement Procedure. The MIS Techniques are designed to be
    less invasive to soft tissues and to shorten recovery time.



Our key hip replacement products include:



ZimmerM/L Taper Hip Prosthesis withKinectiv®Technology. TheZimmerM/L Taper Hip Prosthesis
    offers a proximally porous-coated wedge-shaped design based on
    long term clinically proven concepts. The M/L Taper has become
    widely used in MIS Procedures due to several key design
    features. TheZimmerM/L Taper Hip Prosthesis withKinectivTechnology is a system of modular stem and neck
    components designed to help the surgeon restore the natural hip
    joint center intraoperatively by addressing the key variables of
    leg length, offset and version independently.

    need for bony resection. TheWallissystem combines aPEEK-OPTIMAspacer linked to the vertebrae via a
    polyester band that permits an even distribution of stresses on
    bone.



Trauma





Trauma products include devices used to stabilize damaged or
    broken bones and their surrounding tissues to support the
    body’s natural healing processes. Fractures are most often
    stabilized using internal fixation devices such as plates,
    screws, nails, wires and pins, but may also be stabilized using
    external fixation devices. Orthobiologics are used in
    conjunction with traditional trauma devices to encourage healing
    and replace bone lost during an injury. We are focused on
    providing exceptional options to treat a broad range of
    traumatic injuries, addressing unmet clinical needs

    invest in additional applications of this exciting technology.



ZimmerPeriarticular Locking Plate System.  TheZimmerPeriarticular Locking Plate System combines
    advanced, anatomic designs with locking screw technology to
    create constructs for use in comminuted fractures or where
    deficient bone stock or poor bone quality is encountered. By
    combining locking screw holes with compression slots, the plates
    can be used as both locking devices and fracture compression
    devices.



ZimmerUniversal Locking System.  TheZimmerUniversal Locking System is a comprehensive system of mini
    and small fragment plates, screws and instruments for fracture
    fixation. The Universal Locking System plates resemble standard
    plates, but have figure-8 shaped holes which allow the plates to
    be used as compression plates, locked internal fixators or as an
    internal fixation system combining both techniques.



Zimmer
    Cable-Ready®System.  TheZimmer Cable-ReadySystem includes
    a series of instruments, cables and other implants that help a
    surgeon treat several different fracture types, including those
    that occur around a previously implanted device
    (periprosthetic). The cables are wrapped around the bone and
    then secured, either to themselves or to plates, to provide
    fixation for fractured limbs.

Pennsylvania. Accelero consultants work to design a customized
    program for each client that promotes the active participation
    and collaboration of the physicians and the hospital-based
    departments with the goal of consistently producing a superior
    outcome in the form of a growing, efficient, and effective care
    delivery network. Currently, revenue related to Accelero
    represents less than 1 percent of our total net sales.



ORTHOBIOLOGICS





Our research and development efforts include an Orthobiologics
    group based in Austin, Texas, with its own full-time staff and
    dedicated projects centralizing on the development of a variety
    of biologic technologies for musculoskeletal applications. This
    group works on biological solutions to repair and regenerate
    damaged or degenerated musculoskeletal tissues using
    biomaterials/cell therapies which offer the possibility of
    treating damaged joints by biological repair rather than
    replacing them. A sampling of some of our key projects in the
    Orthobiologics area is set forth below.



We are collaborating with ISTO Technologies, Inc. (ISTO) to
    develop chondral and osteochondral grafts for cartilage repair.
    ISTO creates cell-based therapies for cartilage regeneration
    using cells from juvenile donor cartilage. DeNovo ET Engineered
    Tissue Graft is a living tissue-engineered cartilage graft under
    clinical investigation for the restoration of cartilage defects,
    reestablishment of joint function and relief of pain in the
    knee. The Phase I/II clinical trial for DeNovo ET has been
    completed and the data has been supplied to the FDA with a
    request to allow Zimmer/ISTO to proceed with enrollment with the
    pivotal Phase III clinical trial. In addition, we completed
    the full launch of our first cartilage repair product, DeNovo NT
    Natural Tissue Graft, in 2009. This product provides
    particulated juvenile cartilage tissue for repair of articular
    cartilage defects of the knee, ankle, shoulder, hip, elbow and
    toe joints. More than 700 patients have undergone this
    innovative cartilage repair procedure.



Many musculoskeletal surgical procedures use bone grafts to help
    regenerate lost or damaged bone. Our Spine, Dental and Trauma
    divisions have introduced a technologically advanced all-human
    demineralized bone matrix,PurosDBM Putty and Putty with
    bone chips. This bone-derived allograft material is used to fill
    bone voids or defects. It is placed into the bone void where it
    is then completely replaced by natural bone during the healing
    process.



RESEARCH AND
    DEVELOPMENT





We have extensive research and development activities to develop
    new surgical techniques, materials, orthobiologics and product
    designs. The research and development functions work closely
    with our strategic brand marketing function. The rapid
    commercialization of innovative new materials, orthobiologics
    products, implant and instrument designs and surgical techniques
    remains one of our core strategies and continues to be an
    important driver of sales growth.



We are broadening our product offerings in each of the product
    categories and exploring new technologies with possible
    applications in multiple areas. For the years ended
    December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we spent
    $205.4 million, $192.3 million and
    $182.6 million, respectively, on research and development.
    Our primary research and development facility is located in
    Warsaw, Indiana. We have other research and development
    personnel based in, among other places, Winterthur, Switzerland;
    Austin, Texas; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Carlsbad, California;
    Dover, Ohio; and Parsippany, New Jersey. As of December 31,
    2009, we employed more than 800 research and development
    employees worldwide.



We expect to continue to identify innovative technologies and
    consider acquiring complementary products or businesses, or
    establishing technology licensing arrangements or strategic
    alliances.



GOVERNMENT
    REGULATION AND COMPLIANCE





We are subject to government regulation in the countries in
    which we conduct business. In the U.S., numerous laws and
    regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices
    are brought to market. These include, among others, the Federal
    Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations issued or
    promulgated thereunder. The FDA has enacted regulations that
    control all aspects of the development, manufacture,
    advertising, promotion and postmarket surveillance of medical
    products, including medical devices. In addition, the FDA
    controls the access of products to market through processes
    designed to ensure that only products that are safe and
    effective are made available to the public.

misbranded medical devices; or order the repair, replacement or
    refund of the costs of such devices. There are also certain
    requirements of state, local and foreign governments that we
    must comply with in the manufacture and marketing of our
    products.



In many of the foreign countries in which we market our
    products, we are subject to local regulations affecting, among
    other things, design and product standards, packaging
    requirements and labeling requirements. Many of the regulations
    applicable to our devices and products in these countries are
    similar to those of the FDA. The member countries of the
    European Union have adopted the European Medical Device
    Directive, which creates a single set of medical device
    regulations for products marketed in all member countries.
    Compliance with the Medical Device Directive and certification
    to a quality system enable the manufacturer to place a CE mark
    on its products. To obtain authorization to affix the CE mark to
    a product, a recognized European Notified Body must assess a
    manufacturer’s quality systems and the product’s
    conformity to the requirements of the Medical Device Directive.
    We are subject to inspection by the Notified Bodies for
    compliance with these requirements.



Further, we are subject to various federal and state laws
    concerning healthcare fraud and abuse, including false claims
    laws and anti-kickback laws. These laws are administered by,
    among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of
    Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services
    and state attorneys general. Many of these agencies have
    increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical
    device manufacturers in recent years. Violations of these laws
    are punishable by criminaland/orcivil
    sanctions, including, in some instances, fines, imprisonment
    and, within the United States, exclusion from participation in
    government healthcare programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and
    Veterans Administration (VA) health programs.



Our operations in foreign countries are subject to the
    extraterritorial application of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
    Practices Act (FCPA). As part of our global compliance program,
    we seek to address FCPA risks proactively.



Our facilities and operations are also subject to complex
    federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational
    safety laws and regulations, including those relating to
    discharges of substances in the air, water and land, the
    handling, storage and disposal of wastes and theclean-upof
    properties by pollutants. We do not expect that the ongoing
    costs of compliance with these environmental requirements will
    have a material impact on our consolidated earnings, capital
    expenditures or competitive position.



COMPETITION





The orthopaedics industry is highly competitive. In the global
    markets for reconstructive implants, trauma and related surgical
    products, our major competitors include: DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc. (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Stryker
    Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith & Nephew plc, Wright
    Medical Group, Inc., Synthes, Inc. and Tornier, Inc.



In the Americas geographic segment, we and DePuy Orthopaedics,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet, Inc., Smith &
    Nephew, Inc. (a subsidiary of Smith & Nephew plc),
    Wright Medical Group, Inc. and Synthes, Inc. account for a large
    majority of the total reconstructive and trauma implant sales.



In the Asia Pacific market for reconstructive implant and trauma
    products, we compete primarily with DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.,
    Stryker Corporation, Synthes, Inc. and Smith & Nephew
    plc, as well as regional companies, including Japan Medical
    Materials Corporation and Japan Medical Dynamic Marketing, Inc.
    Factors, such as the dealer system and complex regulatory
    environments, make it difficult for smaller companies,
    particularly those that are non-regional, to compete effectively
    with the market leaders in the Asia Pacific region.



The European reconstructive implant and trauma product markets
    are more fragmented than the Americas or the Asia Pacific
    segments. The variety of philosophies held by European surgeons
    regarding hip reconstruction, for example, has fostered the
    existence of many regional European companies, including
    Aesculap AG (a subsidiary of B. Braun), Waldemar LINK
    GmbH & Co., KG and Mathys AG which, in addition to the
    global competitors, compete with us. Today most hip implants
    sold in Europe are products developed specifically for the
    European market, although global products are gaining
    acceptance. We will continue to develop and produce specially
    tailored products to meet specific European needs.



In the spinal implant category, we compete globally primarily
    with the spinal and biologic business of Medtronic, Inc., DePuy
    Spine (a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson), Synthes,
    Inc., Stryker Corporation, Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine
    (subsidiaries of Biomet, Inc.) and NuVasive, Inc.



In the dental implant category, we compete primarily with Nobel
    Biocare Holding AG, Straumann Holding AG, Astra Tech Dental and
    Biomet 3i (a subsidiary of Biomet, Inc.).



Competition within the industry is primarily based on
    technology, innovation, quality, reputation and customer
    service. A key factor in our continuing success in the future
    will be our ability to develop new products and improve existing
    products and technologies.



MANUFACTURING AND
    RAW MATERIALS





We manufacture substantially all of our products at nine sites
    including Warsaw, Indiana; Winterthur, Switzerland; Ponce,
    Puerto Rico; Dover, Ohio; Statesville, North Carolina; Carlsbad,
    California; Parsippany, New Jersey; Shannon, Ireland; and
    Etupes, France.



We believe that our manufacturing facilities are among the best
    in our industry in terms of automation and productivity and have
    the flexibility to accommodate future growth. The manufacturing
    operations at these facilities are designed to incorporate the
    cellular concept for production and to implement tenets of a
    manufacturing philosophy focused on continuous operational
    improvement and optimization. Our continuous improvement efforts
    are driven by Lean and Six Sigma methodologies. In addition, at
    certain













ZIMMER
    HOLDINGS, INC.2009FORM 10-KANNUAL REPORT



of our manufacturing facilities, many of the employees are
    cross-trained to perform a broad array of operations.



We generally target operating our manufacturing facilities at
    levels up to 90 percent of total capacity. We continually
    evaluate the potential to in-source products currently purchased
    from outside vendors toon-siteproduction.



We have improved our manufacturing processes to protect our
    profitability and offset the impact of inflationary costs. We
    have, for example, employed computer-assisted robots and
    multi-axis grinders to precision polish medical devices;
    automated certain manufacturing and inspection processes,
    including on-machine inspection and process controls; purchasedstate-of-the-artequipment; in-sourced core products, such as castings and
    forgings; and negotiated reductions in third party supplier
    costs.



We use a diverse and broad range of raw materials in the
    manufacturing of our products. We purchase all of our raw
    materials and select components used in manufacturing our
    products from external suppliers. In addition, we purchase some
    supplies from single sources for reasons of quality assurance,
    sole source availability, cost effectiveness or constraints
    resulting from regulatory requirements. We work closely with our
    suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high
    quality and reliability. To date, we have not experienced any
    significant difficulty in locating and obtaining the materials
    necessary to fulfill our production schedules.



INTELLECTUAL
    PROPERTY





Patents and other proprietary rights are important to the
    continued success of our business. We also rely upon trade
    secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and
    licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive
    position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of
    methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary
    information agreements with vendors, employees, consultants and
    others who may have access to proprietary information. We own or
    control through licensing arrangements more than 4,000 issued
    patents and patent applications throughout the world that relate
    to aspects of the technology incorporated in many of our
    products.



EMPLOYEES





We employ more than 8,200 employees worldwide, including
    more than 800 employees dedicated to research and
    development. Approximately 4,900 employees are located
    within the United States and approximately 3,300 employees
