Engine



The Engine Group develops and manufactures products to manage engines for fuel efficiency, reduced emissions and enhanced performance. Concern about fuel prices and availability, as well as the need to lower CO2emissions, are driving demand for the Company's products in gasoline and diesel engines and alternative powertrains. The Engine Group's products include: turbochargers, timing devices and chains, emissions systems, thermal systems, diesel cold start, gasoline ignition technology and cabin heaters.



The Engine Group provides turbochargers for light, commercial and off-highway applications for diesel and gasoline engine manufacturers in the Americas, Europe and Asia.  The Engine Group has greatly benefited from the growth in turbocharger demand in Europe.  This growth is linked to increasing demand for diesel engines in light vehicles, which typically use turbochargers, and for turbocharged gasoline engines.  Benefits of turbochargers in light, commercial and off-highway applications include increased power for a given engine size, improved fuel economy and reduced emissions.











Sales of turbochargers for light vehicles represented approximately 26% of total net sales for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company currently supplies light vehicle turbochargers to many OEMs including  BMW, Daimler, Fiat, Ford, General Motors, Hyundai, PSA, Renault and Volkswagen. The Company also supplies commercial vehicle turbochargers to Daimler, Deutz, MAN and Navistar and off-highway turbochargers to Caterpillar and John Deere.



The Company's newest turbocharger technologies are its regulated two-stage turbocharging system, known as R2S®, regulated 3-stage turbocharging systems ("R3S"), variable turbine geometry ("VTG") turbochargers and turbochargers for gasoline direct injected engines, all of which may be found in numerous applications around the world. For example, the Company supplies its award winning R2S® turbocharger technology to Volkswagen's 2.0 liter four-cylinder common-rail diesel engine featured in the Transporter T5 and Amarok pickup and its R3S turbocharger system, an industry first, to BMW for its new high-powered 3.0 liter diesel engine. Also, the Company supplies VTG turbochargers to Renault's 1.6 liter R9M diesel engine featured in the Mégane Scénic and to Great Wall for its 2.0 liter diesel engine. Ford selected BorgWarner's leading gasoline turbocharger technology for its new 1.6 liter and 2.0 liter four-cylinder EcoBoost engines, the latter of which launched in the U.S. in the 2012 Explorer and 2012 Edge models and in China in the Ford Mondeo.



The Engine Group's timing systems products include timing chain, variable cam timing (“VCT”), crankshaft and camshaft sprockets, tensioners, guides and snubbers, HY-VO® front-wheel drive (“FWD”) transmission chain and four-wheel drive (“4WD”) chain for light vehicles.



The Company is a leading manufacturer of timing chain systems to OEMs around the world. BorgWarner timing chain systems are featured on Ford's family of engines, including the Duratec, Modular and in-line four-cylinder engines, Chrysler's 3.6 liter Pentastar engine, Volkswagen's EA888 family, Hyundai's Gamma, Nu and Theta families and numerous other applications around the world.



The Engine Group's newest product technology is its VCT with mid position lock, which allows a greater range of camshaft positioning thereby enabling greater control over airflow and the opportunity to improve fuel economy, reduce emissions and improve engine performance compared with conventional VCT systems. VCT with mid position lock made its debut on Subaru's Boxer® 2.0 liter engine. BorgWarner is currently working with a number of other OEMs interested in implementing this technology.  The Company is a leading manufacturer of chain for drivetrain systems. The Company's HY-VO® chain is used to transfer power from the engine to the drivetrain in FWD transmissions and also in 4WD transfer cases, which distributes power between a vehicle's front and rear wheels.



The Engine Group also designs and manufactures products to control emissions and improve fuel economy. These products include electric air pumps, turbo actuators using integrated electronics to precisely control turbocharger speed and pressure ratio and exhaust gas recirculation ("EGR") coolers, tubes and valves for gasoline and diesel applications. In 2010, the Company acquired Dytech Ensa S.L., a leading producer of EGR coolers, EGR tubes and integrated EGR modules including valves for light, commercial and off-highway applications.



The Company is a leading global provider of engine thermal solutions for truck, agricultural and off-highway applications. The Engine Group designs, manufactures and markets viscous fan drives that control fans to sense and respond to multiple cooling requirements. The Engine Group also manufactures and markets polymer fans for engine cooling systems. The Company's thermal products provide improved vehicle fuel economy and reduced engine emissions while minimizing parasitic horsepower loss. The Company has been awarded the "standard position" (the OEM-designated preferred supplier of component systems available to the end-customer) at several major global heavy truck producers.











The Company is a leading global automotive supplier of diesel cold start technology (glow plugs and instant starting systems), including its Pressure Sensor Glow Plug which monitors and enhances the combustion process of a diesel engine, minimizing CO2 and NOx emissions. The Company also designs and manufactures gasoline ignition technology and electronic control units and sensor technology (diesel cabin heaters and selected sensors).



In 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology is expected to enable high-performing, lean burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.



In 2010, in anticipation of market growth expected for its electric cabin heaters, the Company completed the acquisition of BERU-Eichenauer GmbH by acquiring the shares of its former joint venture partner, Eichenauer Heizelemente GmbH & Co. KG. The former 50/50 joint venture was formed in 2000 to develop and manufacture electric cabin heaters.



The Company sold its tire pressure monitoring and spark plug businesses during the fourth quarter of 2011 and third quarter of 2012, respectively. The sale of these businesses will allow the Company to continue to focus on expanding BERU Systems' core products of glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition technologies.



Drivetrain



The Drivetrain Group designs and manufactures automatic transmission components and modules and is a supplier to virtually every major automatic transmission manufacturer in the world for conventional automatic, dual clutch transmissions (“DCT”), automated manual transmissions and continuously variable transmissions. In conventional automatic transmissions, there has been a global market trend from four and five speeds to six, seven and eight speed transmissions. Transmissions with more speeds improve fuel economy and vehicle performance and offer growth opportunities.



Friction and mechanical products include dual clutch modules, friction clutch modules, friction and steel plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers. Controls products feature electro-hydraulic solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems, transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner KK ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan and China.



The Company has led the globalization of today's DCT technology for over 10 years. Following the development of its DCT technology in the 1990s, the Company established its industry-leading position in 2003 with the production launch of its award-winning DualTronic® innovations with VW/Audi. In 2007, the Company launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan.



The Company has announced DCT programs with customers that include VW/Audi, SAIC and Nissan, in addition to Getrag DCT programs with BMW, Ford and other global automakers. The Company is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs around the world. BorgWarner DualTronic® technology enables a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when shifting a single clutch manual transmission. The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency and great driving experience of a manual gearbox.



In 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment Company, a company owned by 12 leading Chinese automakers, to produce various DCT modules for the Chinese market. The joint venture's operations are located in Dalian, China and production is scheduled to begin in 2013. The Company owns 66% of the joint venture.











The Drivetrain Group's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)/all-wheel drive ("AWD") transfer case systems, FWD/AWD coupling systems and cross-axle coupling systems. The Company's focus is on developing electronically controlled torque management devices and systems that will benefit vehicle dynamics, fuel economy and stability.



Transfer cases are installed on RWD based light trucks, SUVs, cross-over utility vehicles (“CUVs”), and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. There are many variants of the Company's transfer case technology in the market today, including Torque On-Demand (TOD®), chain-driven, gear-driven, 1-speed and 2-speed transfer cases. The Company's transfer cases are featured on the Ford F-150 and on the Dodge Ram light-duty and heavy-duty trucks.



The Company is involved in the AWD market for FWD based vehicles with couplings that use electronically-controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels instantly as traction is required. The Company's latest coupling innovation, the Centrifugal Electro-Hydraulic (“CEH”) Actuator, which is utilized to engage the clutches in the coupling, produces outstanding vehicle stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy with reduced weight. The CEH Actuator is found in the AWD couplings featured in several current FWD/AWD vehicles including the Audi A3, Skoda Octavia,Volvo XC60 and VW Golf.



In 2011, the Company acquired the Traction Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of innovative AWD products for the global vehicle industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. This acquisition has accelerated BorgWarner's growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward FWD based vehicles. The acquisition will continue to add industry leading AWD technologies for FWD based vehicles, with a strong European customer base, to BorgWarner's portfolio of front- and rear-wheel drive based products. This enables BorgWarner to offer global customers a broader range of AWD solutions to meet their vehicle needs.

No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net sales in any of the years  presented.



The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon OEM production schedules. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.



Sales and Marketing



Each of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our business units are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or more of a business unit's products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business.  Because of their close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of our products' design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers.



In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine and Drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities for the business units. The development of DualTronic®, the Company's wet-clutch and control-system technology for a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a successful collaboration.



Seasonality



Our operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter.



Research and Development



The Company conducts advanced Engine and Drivetrain research at the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new Engine and Drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized. This function manages a venture capital fund that was created by the Company as seed money for new innovation and collaboration across businesses.



In addition, each of the Company's business units within its two reporting segments has its own research and development (“R&D”) organization, including engineers and technicians, engaged in R&D activities at facilities worldwide. The Company also operates testing facilities such as prototype, measurement and calibration, life cycle testing and dynamometer laboratories.











By working closely with the OEMs and anticipating their future product needs, the Company's R&D personnel conceive, design, develop and manufacture new proprietary automotive components and systems. R&D personnel also work to improve current products and production processes. The Company believes its commitment to R&D will allow it to obtain new orders from its OEM customers.



The Company's net R&D expenditures are included in selling, general and administrative expenses of the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Customer reimbursements are netted against gross R&D expenditures as they are considered a recovery of cost. Customer reimbursements for prototypes are recorded net of prototype costs based on customer contracts, typically either when the prototype is shipped or when it is accepted by the customer. Customer reimbursements for engineering services are recorded when performance obligations are satisfied in accordance with the contract and accepted by the customer. Financial risks and rewards transfer upon shipment, acceptance of a prototype component by the customer or upon completion of the performance obligation as stated in the respective customer agreement.

Net R&D expenditures as a percentage of net sales were3.7%,3.4%and3.3%in the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company has contracts with several customers at the Company's various R&D locations. No such contract exceeded5%of net R&D expenditures in any of the years presented.



Intellectual Property



The Company has more than 4,200 active domestic and foreign patents and patent applications pending or under preparation, and receives royalties from licensing patent rights to others. While it considers its patents on the whole to be important, the Company does not consider any single patent, any group of related patents or any single license essential to its operations in the aggregate or to the operations of any of the Company's business groups individually. The expiration of the patents individually and in the aggregate is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's financial position or future operating results. The Company owns numerous trademarks, some of which are valuable, but none of which are essential to its business in the aggregate.



The Company owns the “BorgWarner” and “Borg-Warner Automotive” trade names and housemarks, and variations thereof, which are material to the Company's business.
