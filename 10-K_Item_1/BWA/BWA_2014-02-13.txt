The Company sold its tire pressure monitoring and spark plug businesses during the fourth quarter of 2011 and third quarter of 2012, respectively. The sale of these businesses will allow the Company to continue to focus on expanding BERU Systems' core products of glow plugs, diesel cold start systems and other gasoline ignition technologies.



In 2009, the Company announced the purchase of advanced gasoline ignition technology and related intellectual property from Florida-based Etatech, Inc. The high-frequency ignition technology is expected to enable high-performing, lean-burning engines to significantly improve fuel economy and reduce emissions compared with conventional combustion technologies.



Drivetrain



The Drivetrain Segment develops and manufactures products for automatic transmissions and all-wheel drive ("AWD") vehicles. Precise controls, better response times and minimal parasitic losses, all of which  improve fuel economy and vehicle performance, are the core design features of the Drivetrain Segment's product portfolio. The Drivetrain Segment's products include friction, mechanical and controls products for automatic transmissions and torque management products for AWD vehicles.



Friction and mechanical products for automatic transmissions include dual clutch modules, friction clutch modules, friction and steel plates, transmission bands, torque converter clutches, one-way clutches and torsional vibration dampers. Controls products for automatic transmissions feature electro-hydraulic solenoids for standard and high pressure hydraulic systems, transmission solenoid modules and dual clutch control modules. The Company's 50%-owned joint venture in Japan, NSK-Warner KK ("NSK-Warner"), is a leading producer of friction plates and one-way clutches in Japan and China.



The Drivetrain Segment has led the globalization of today's dual clutch transmission ("DCT") technology for over 10 years. BorgWarner's award-winning DualTronic® technology enables a conventional, manual gearbox to function as a fully automatic transmission by eliminating the interruption in power flow that occurs when shifting a single clutch manual transmission. The result is a smooth shifting automatic transmission with the fuel efficiency and driving experience of a manual gearbox.



The Drivetrain Segment established its industry-leading position in 2003 with the production launch of its DualTronic® innovations with VW/Audi, followed by program launches with Ford and BMW. In 2007, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first dual-clutch technology application in a Japanese transmission with Nissan. In 2008, the Company entered into a joint venture agreement with China Automobile Development United Investment Company, a company owned by 12 leading Chinese automakers, to produce various DCT modules for the Chinese market. The Company owns 66% of the joint venture. In 2013, the Drivetrain Segment launched its first DCT application in a Chinese transmission with SAIC. The Drivetrain Segment is working on several other DCT programs with OEMs around the world.











The Drivetrain Segment's torque management products include rear-wheel drive (“RWD”)/AWD transfer case systems, FWD/AWD coupling systems and cross-axle coupling systems. The Drivetrain Segment's focus is on developing electronically controlled torque management devices and systems that will benefit fuel economy and vehicle dynamics.



Transfer cases are installed on RWD based light trucks, SUVs, cross-over utility vehicles, and passenger cars. A transfer case attaches to the transmission and distributes torque to the front and rear axles improving vehicle traction and stability in dynamic driving conditions. There are many variants of the Drivetrain Segment's transfer case technology in the market today, including Torque On-Demand (TOD®), chain-driven, gear-driven, 1-speed and 2-speed transfer cases. The Drivetrain Segment's transfer cases are featured on the Ford F-150 and on the Dodge Ram light-duty and heavy-duty trucks.



The Drivetrain Segment is involved in the AWD market for FWD based vehicles with couplings that use electronically-controlled clutches to distribute power to the rear wheels as traction is required. The Drivetrain Segment's latest coupling innovation, the Centrifugal Electro-Hydraulic (“CEH”) Actuator, which is utilized to engage the clutches in the coupling, produces outstanding vehicle stability and traction while promoting better fuel economy with reduced weight. The CEH Actuator is found in the AWD couplings featured in several current FWD/AWD vehicles including the Audi A3, Skoda Octavia,Volvo XC60 and VW Golf.



In 2011, the Company acquired the Traction Systems division of Haldex Group, a leading provider of innovative AWD products for the global vehicle industry headquartered in Stockholm, Sweden. This acquisition has accelerated BorgWarner's growth in the global AWD market as it continues to shift toward FWD based vehicles. The acquisition adds industry leading AWD technologies for FWD based vehicles, with a strong European customer base, to BorgWarner's portfolio of front- and rear-wheel drive based products and enables BorgWarner to offer global customers a broader range of AWD solutions to meet their vehicle needs.

The Company's automotive products are generally sold directly to OEMs, substantially pursuant to negotiated annual contracts, long-term supply agreements or terms and conditions as may be modified by the parties. Deliveries are subject to periodic authorizations based upon OEM production schedules. The Company typically ships its products directly from its plants to the OEMs.



Sales and Marketing



Each of the Company's businesses within its two reporting segments has its own sales function. Account executives for each of our businesses are assigned to serve specific OEM customers for one or more of a businesses' products. Our account executives spend the majority of their time in direct contact with OEM purchasing and engineering employees and are responsible for servicing existing business and for identifying and obtaining new business.  Because of their close relationship with OEMs, account executives are able to identify and meet customers' needs based upon their knowledge of our products' design and manufacturing capabilities. Upon securing a new order, account executives participate in product launch team activities and serve as a key interface with customers.



In addition, the sales and marketing employees of our Engine and Drivetrain reporting segments often work together to explore cross-development opportunities for the businesses. The development of DualTronic®, the Company's wet-clutch and control-system technology for a new-concept automated transmission, is an example of a successful collaboration.



Seasonality



Our operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we may experience seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants typically close for model year changeovers or vacations. Historically, model changeovers or vacations have generally resulted in lower sales volume in the third quarter.



Research and Development



The Company conducts advanced Engine and Drivetrain research at the reporting segment level. This advanced engineering function looks to leverage know-how and expertise across product lines to create new Engine and Drivetrain systems and modules that can be commercialized.
