and

, which are licensed, as well as various other licensed and private label brands. In addition, through the end of the third quarter of 2013, we owned and operated businesses under the

G.H. Bass & Co.

and

Bass

trademarks. We design and market branded dress shirts, neckwear, sportswear, jeanswear, intimate apparel, swim products and, to a lesser extent, handbags, footwear and other related products. Additionally, we license our owned brands over a broad range of products. We market our brands globally at multiple price points and across multiple channels of distribution, allowing us to provide products to a broad range of consumers, while minimizing competition among our brands and reducing our reliance on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or geographic region. During 2014, our directly operated businesses in North America consisted principally of wholesale dress shirts, neckwear and underwear sales under our owned and licensed brands; wholesale men’s sportswear sales under our

Calvin Klein

,

Tommy Hilfiger

,

Van Heusen

,

IZOD

and

ARROW

brands; wholesale men’s and women’s jeanswear and underwear sales under our

Calvin Klein

brand; wholesale










women’s intimate apparel sales under ourWarner’sandOlgabrands; wholesale swimwear, fitness apparel, swim accessories and related product sales under theSpeedobrand; and the operation of retail stores, principally in premium outlet centers, under ourCalvin Klein,Tommy Hilfiger,Van HeusenandIZODbrands and, through the end of the third quarter of 2013, theG.H. Bass & Co.andBassbrands. During 2014, our directly operated businesses outside of North America consisted principally of our Tommy Hilfiger International wholesale and retail businesses in Europe and Japan; our Calvin Klein wholesale and retail businesses in Europe, Asia and Latin America; and our wholesale Calvin Klein Collection business in Europe. Our licensing activities principally related to the licensing worldwide of ourCalvin KleinandTommy Hilfigertrademarks for a broad range of lifestyle products and for specific geographic regions.



On February 13, 2013, we acquired Warnaco, which followed our transformational acquisitions of Calvin Klein in 2003 and Tommy Hilfiger in 2010, and reinforced our strategy to assume more direct control over various licensed businesses where we believe we can leverage our core competencies and drive the

Calvin Klein

brand’s reach globally. Prior to the acquisition, Warnaco was our largest

Calvin Klein

licensee. The Warnaco acquisition provided us with direct global control of the brand image and commercial operations for the two largest

Calvin Klein

apparel categories - jeanswear and underwear. With these categories under our ownership, our teams are focused on unifying our brand messaging for a more consistent customer experience across regions and product lines. In conjunction with this, we invested in our people, products, infrastructure, supply chain and distribution. We believe that these steps will strengthen

Calvin Klein

’s image, positioning and execution across all markets to drive sustainable global growth. The Warnaco acquisition also provided a broader global platform for both the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger businesses and has enabled us to continue to transform from a primarily North American multi-brand business with strong European Tommy Hilfiger operations, to a more diversified, global organization. We intend to take advantage of our and Warnaco’s complementary geographic operations; the former Warnaco operations in Asia and Brazil should enhance our opportunities in those regions, and we have the opportunity to leverage our expertise and infrastructure in North America and Europe to enhance the growth and profitability of the Calvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear businesses in those regions. The acquisition also added the

Speedo

,

Warner’s

and

Olga

brands to our Heritage Brands portfolio, which are complementary to our existing offerings, given their leading market share positions within their respective industries and healthy cash flows. With a diversified brand portfolio and operations in every major consumer market around the world, we believe the acquisition makes our business better balanced across geographies, channels of distribution, product categories and price points, and creates opportunity to realize revenue growth and enhanced profitability over the long term.



We aggregate our segments into three main businesses: (i) Calvin Klein, which consists of the Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments, (ii) Tommy Hilfiger, which consists of the Tommy Hilfiger North America and Tommy Hilfiger International segments and (iii) Heritage Brands, which consists of the Heritage Brands Wholesale and Heritage Brands Retail segments. Note 19, “Segment Data,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report contains information with respect to revenue, income before interest and taxes and assets related to each segment, as well as information regarding our revenue generated from foreign and domestic sources, and the geographic locations where our long-lived assets are held.



Our revenue reached a record $8.241 billion in 2014, approximately 45% of which was generated internationally. Our global designer lifestyle brands,Calvin KleinandTommy Hilfiger, together generated over 75% of our revenue during 2014.



We sold substantially all of the assets of our Bass business on November 4, 2013 and announced in January 2015 that we will exit our Izod retail business during 2015.

Calvin Klein Business Overview



We believe Calvin Klein is one of the best known designer names in the world. In order to more efficiently and effectively exploit the development opportunities forCalvin Klein, a tiered-brand strategy was established to provide a focused, consistent approach to global brand growth and development. Each of theCalvin Kleinbrands occupies a distinct marketing identity and position that preserves the brand’s premium positioning and image, while also allowing us to market products both domestically and internationally, at a variety of price points and to various consumer groups. TheCalvin Kleinbrands are as follows:

•Calvin Klein Collection— our “halo” brand, under which men’s and women’s high-end designer apparel and accessories, as well as items for the home, are sold through the wholesale channel across the globe and through flagship stores in Asia and our ownCalvin Klein Collectionretail flagship store on Madison Avenue in New York City;

•Calvin Klein(platinum label)—our “bridge” brand, formerly known asck Calvin Klein, was rebranded in 2013 in order to unify theCalvin Kleinbrands under one umbrella. This line offers apparel and accessories, which are sold in the wholesale channel through specialty and department stores in various regions, as well as in free-standing stores in Asia;

•Calvin Klein(white label) — our “better” brand includes offerings such as men’s sportswear and dress furnishings, men’s and women’s outerwear, fragrance, accessories, footwear, performance apparel, women’s sportswear, dresses and handbags and items for the home. Distribution is primarily in North America through department stores and free-standing stores;

•Calvin Klein Jeans— offerings under this label include men’s and women’s jeans and related apparel, which are distributed worldwide, and denim accessories, which are distributed in Europe and Asia; and

•Calvin Klein Underwear— offerings under this label include men’s and women’s underwear, sleepwear and loungewear, which are distributed worldwide.



Calvin Klein oversees the design and development of all products sold under theCalvin Kleinbrands, as well as worldwide marketing, advertising and promotional programs for the brands. We believe that maintaining control over design and advertising through Calvin Klein’s dedicated in-house teams plays a key role in the continued strength of the brands. In 2014, over $400 million was spent globally in connection with the advertising, marketing and promotion of theCalvin Kleinbrands and these expenses were principally funded by Calvin Klein’s licensees and other authorized users of the brands.



Through our Calvin Klein North America and Calvin Klein International segments, we sellCalvin Kleinproducts in a variety of distribution channels, as discussed below:



•Calvin KleinWholesale — We operate wholesale businesses, as mentioned above, through which we distribute and sellCalvin Kleinproducts to third party retailers and distributors (in brick and mortar stores and online through e-commerce sites). Given the various price points at which products under the variousCalvin Kleinbrands are sold, we have a range of wholesale customers. For example, within North America, ourCalvin Kleinwhite label men’s dress shirts, neckwear and sportswear are marketed at better price points and are distributed principally in better fashion department and specialty stores, including Macy’s, Inc. and Macys.com. OurCalvin Klein CollectionandCalvin Kleinplatinum label dress shirts are sold into the more limited channels of luxury or premier department and specialty stores (in stores and online), as well as through free-standing stores.OurCalvin Klein Jeans and Calvin Klein Underwear businesses primarily distribute products through department stores, chain stores, Company-operated retail stores, shop-in-shop/concession locations and stores operated under retail licenses and/or distributor agreements and through e-commerce sites operated by key department store customers and pure play e-commerce retailers.

•Calvin KleinRetail — We operate retail businesses in North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America. OurCalvin Kleinstores in the United States and Canada are located primarily in premium outlet centers and offer men’s and women’s apparel and otherCalvin Kleinwhite label products to communicate theCalvin Kleinlifestyle. We also operate full-price and outlet stores and shop-in-shop/concession shops in Europe, Asia, Mexico and Brazil where we offerCalvin Klein JeansandCalvin Klein Underwearproducts. Across our regional businesses,Calvin Kleinproducts are also sold through our company-operated e-commerce sites.

Licensing — We maintain licensing and similar arrangements globally for use of the

Calvin Klein

brands in connection with a broad array of products, including women’s dresses and suits, men’s tailored clothing, women’s sportswear and performance apparel, golf apparel, fragrances, cosmetics, eyewear, hosiery, socks, footwear, jewelry, watches, outerwear, handbags, small leather goods and home furnishings. In these arrangements, Calvin Klein combines its design, marketing and branding skills with the specific manufacturing, distribution and geographic capabilities of its licensing and other partners to develop, market and distribute these goods. Calvin Klein has approximately 65 licensing and other arrangements across the

Calvin Klein

brands. The arrangements generally are exclusive to a territory or product category. Additionally, we formed a joint venture, PVH Brands Australia Pty. Limited (“PVH Australia”), in 2013, in which we own a 50% economic interest. The joint venture licenses through a subsidiary the rights to distribute and sell

Calvin Klein

brand products in Australia, New Zealand and other island nations in the South Pacific. In 2014, we contributed to the joint venture our subsidiaries that were operating the Calvin Klein Jeans businesses in Australia and New Zealand and, in connection with this contribution, these subsidiaries were deconsolidated. As part of the Warnaco acquisition, we acquired a 51% interest in a joint venture in India, which licenses the rights to the

Calvin Klein

trademarks in India. During the first quarter of 2014, our joint venture partners’ interests were sold to a new shareholder and, as a result of the entry into a shareholder agreement with different governing arrangements as compared to the arrangements with the prior minority shareholders, we were deemed to no longer hold a controlling interest in the joint venture. As a result, the joint venture was deconsolidated.

Founded in 1985,Tommy Hilfigerdelivers premium styling, quality and value to consumers worldwide.

We continue to focus on elevating our products, reaching existing and new consumers with our eclectic “Hilfiger family” global advertising campaigns and investing in innovative in-store experiences to drive the brand globally.

•

Licensing — We license the

Tommy Hilfiger

brands to third parties both for specific product categories and in certain geographic regions, and generally on an exclusive basis. Tommy Hilfiger has over 25 license agreements.

Tommy Hilfiger

products are also sold through joint ventures in which we are a partner in China, India and Brazil, and, beginning in 2015, Australia, and by third party distributors, licensees and franchisees in Europe, Southeast Asia, Australia, Central and South America and the Caribbean. In 2010, we formed a joint venture in China in which we own a 45% economic interest. The joint venture assumed direct control of the licensed Tommy Hilfiger wholesale and retail distribution business in China from the prior licensee in August 2011. In September 2011, we acquired the perpetually licensed rights to the

Tommy Hilfiger

trademarks in India from GVM International Limited (“GVM”) and acquired from affiliates of GVM a 50% economic interest in a company that was renamed Tommy Hilfiger Arvind Fashion Private Limited (“TH India”). TH India was GVM’s sublicensee of the

Tommy Hilfiger

trademarks for apparel, footwear and handbags in India. As a result of the transaction, TH India is now the direct licensee of the trademarks for all categories (other than fragrance), operates a wholesale apparel, footwear and handbags business in connection with its license and sublicenses the trademarks for certain other product categories in the region. In November 2012, we formed, with an experienced local partner, a joint venture in Brazil in which we own a 40% economic interest. The joint venture holds an exclusive license for the

Tommy Hilfiger

brand in Brazil that became effective in January 2013. Most recently, subsequent to the end of 2014, we completed a transaction whereby the Tommy Hilfiger businesses in Australia (which had previously been licensed to a third party) were added to our existing joint venture in Australia (which previously only licensed the

Calvin Klein

brand).

Licensing.We license our heritage brands globally for a broad range of products through approximately 35 domestic and 45 international license agreements covering approximately 165 territories combined.

We grant licensing partners the right to manufacture and sell at wholesale specified products under one or more of our brands. In addition, certain foreign licensees are granted the right to open retail stores under the licensed brand name. A substantial portion of the sales by our domestic licensing partners is made to our largest wholesale customers. We provide support to our licensing partners and seek to preserve the integrity of our brand names by taking an active role in the design, quality control, advertising, marketing and distribution of each licensed product, most of which are subject to our prior approval and continuing oversight.



Subsequent to the end of 2014, we completed a transaction whereby the Van Heusen business in Australia (which had previously been licensed to a third party) was sold (and the existing licensee assigned) to our joint venture in Australia at the same time asTommy Hilfigerwas licensed, and certain assets of the existing Tommy Hilfiger business were sold, to the joint venture.

Our Business Strategy



PVH has a long history of financial growth and operational excellence. Our management team has grown the business to over $8 billion in revenues in 2014, and we are one of largest apparel companies in the world. We see opportunity for significant growth as we employ our strategic initiatives across our organization. Our global growth strategies include:

•Realizing the long-term Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger and Heritage Brands revenue opportunities;

•Investing in global platforms and operations to support global growth;

•Capturing the digital opportunity, as we focus on growing our sales across all platforms;

•Expanding our brands’ presence in Asia and Latin America;










•Optimizing our global supply chain to support and drive strategic brand initiatives;

•Investing in and developing our global talent; and

•Acquiring licensed businesses where and when we believe that we can leverage our core competencies to operate the business.



Calvin Klein Business



We believe significant growth opportunities exist to driveCalvin Kleinglobal retail sales further over time, which include:



Brand Management.Given our wide distribution across geographies and distribution channels, we are focused on maintaining brand consistency. We seek to ensure that our products, quality and distribution reflectCalvin Klein’s premium designer status worldwide. To that extent, we are continually investing in elevating the brand and enhancing product offerings to provide value to consumers. We also support our product lines with 360○marketing and communications campaigns (featuring traditional, as well as social and digital media), which are designed to engage consumers, drive brand awareness and encourage consumers to purchase our products.



Strategic Repositioning of the European Business.Europe is the lowest performing region for Calvin Klein, and we are committed to improving margins and generating healthier and more profitable sales. The largestCalvin Kleinproduct offerings in the region includeCalvin Klein Underwear, which is performing well, andCalvin Klein Jeans, which is underperforming. We are focused on enhancing our jeanswear product, investing in quality, styling and fits, to address this underperformance. We are also investing in shop-in-shops and retail stores to elevate the in-store shopping experience for theCalvin Kleinconsumer, while also significantly reducing the brand’s distribution in the off-price and club channel. Over time, our objective is to enhance the overall brand image in Europe and leverage the strength ofCalvin Klein Underwearto generate sales in jeanswear and other categories. To support these initiatives, we have launched marketing campaigns as discussed above.



Category expansion.We have identified several categories where we believe thatCalvinKleinis underpenetrated. These categories include:

•Apparel — Outside of North America, ourCalvin Kleinapparel assortments are underpenetrated compared to ourTommy Hilfigerofferings. We believe that we can grow our non-domestic apparel sales, given our strong brand positioning and proven success in other brand offerings. We believe that jeanswear, womenswear and men’s tailored offerings represent significant opportunities, both in North America and internationally.

•Accessories — We see opportunity to grow our handbag, small leather goods and accessories offerings across our geographies. In North America, we are opening free-standingCalvin Kleinaccessories outlet stores, based on encouraging performance in the category. We are also introducing and developing the accessories category in Asia, Europe and Latin America.

•Women’s Intimates — We believe that we can further expand and improve the performance of our women’s intimates assortments, particularly as we leverage our strong positioning and brand awareness in men’s underwear. To that extent, we have been focused on improving our designs, detailing and quality. Fit has been another key focus area, and we are adding extended women’s sizing and tailoring products to accommodate different regional markets. As we make these changes, we also continue to advance our sourcing capabilities, including taking a more regionalized approach, reducing lead times to allow us to respond to customer purchasing patterns and improving speed-to-market for our core and replenishment categories. We have been pleased with performance of several recent global launches, includingModern CottonandPerfectly Fit.



Channel mix.We believe that theCalvin Kleinbrand has healthy growth ahead of it. We see the potential for growth across many of our key channels of distribution, including:

•E-commerce — Across all of our geographies, we seek to grow our e-commerce sales within our directly operated sites, as well as those operated by key customers. Accordingly, we have been making significant investments to enhance the functionality, technology and navigation of our e-commerce sites. We are also investing to expand the number of countries to which we ship. To accommodate this growth, we have invested in expanding our supply chain and logistics capabilities.










•Retail expansion — We see room for square footage growth across most of our geographies. We see the largest potential to open additional retail locations in Asia, Latin America, Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Europe, the United States and Canada.

•Wholesale expansion — We believe that we can continue to gain market share and expand our floor space across our key markets.

•Travel retail — Travel retail locations, which are located in major airports across the world, are an important component of Calvin Klein’s growth. We see the largest opportunity to open additional travel retail locations in Asia and Latin America.



Tommy Hilfiger Business



SinceTommy Hilfigerhas been under our ownership, the brand’s growth and performance has exceeded our expectations. We believe that we can further growTommy Hilfigerthrough a number of product and regional initiatives which include:





Brand Management.Given our wide distribution across geographies and distribution channels, we are focused on maintaining brand consistency. We seek to ensure that our products, quality and distribution reflectTommy Hilfiger’s premium designer status worldwide. To that extent, we are continually elevating our product offerings to provide value to our consumers. These enhancements have resulted in growth in sales and improved profitability in 2014 in our European and North American businesses. Additionally, we support our product lines with compelling 360○marketing and communications campaigns, which are focused on engaging consumers, driving brand awareness and encouraging consumers to purchase our products.



Category expansion.We have identified several categories where we believe that Tommy Hilfiger is underpenetrated. These categories include:

•Men’s tailored clothing — We acquired the European men’s tailored license in 2012. We believe that we can grow this business as we leverage our core competencies in dress furnishings and tailored apparel.

•Underwear — We see significant room to grow the Tommy Hilfiger underwear business as we leverage ourCalvin Klein Underwearexpertise with regards to fit, styling, sourcing and fabrics. Emphasizing our ongoing support for the underwear and tailored categories, in December 2014, Tommy Hilfiger announced that internationally renowned tennis star Rafael Nadal will appear as the global brand ambassador for theTommy Hilfigerunderwear andTommy Hilfiger Tailoredcollections beginning in Fall 2015.

•Women’s apparel and accessories —We believe that we can grow our womenswear assortments, particularly in Asia, our least penetrated market. Across the world, our women’s offerings are notably underpenetrated compared to the industry standard of approximately 60%-65%. Throughout 2014, we undertook several efforts to raise awareness of and grow this business, which were successful, including the expansion of theHilfiger Collectionwholesale strategy, introduction of a capsule collection with actress Zooey Deschanel and our partnership with Alexa Chung, a model, author and TV personality who is widely known throughout the fashion community.



Channel mix.We believe that theTommy Hilfigerbrand has healthy growth ahead of it. We see the potential for growth across many of our key channels of distribution, including:

•E-commerce — Across all of our geographies, we seek to grow our e-commerce sales within our directly operated sites, as well as those operated by key customers. Accordingly, we have been making significant investments to enhance the functionality, technology and user experience across our e-commerce sites. We are also investing to expand the number of countries to which we ship.

•Retail expansion — We see room for square footage growth across most of our geographies. We see the largest potential to open additional retail locations inthe Middle East and Africa, along with France and the United Kingdom and continued growth in Northern Europe and North America. In addition, we operate concession businesses in key department stores in Japan and see opportunities to secure additional key locations to expand our presence and elevate the brand.

•Wholesale expansion — We believe that we can continue to gain market share and expand floor space across key markets and enhance the brand’s distribution of elevated product categories, includingHilfiger CollectionandTommy Hilfiger Tailored.










•Growing our licensed operations — Our licensed operations in Latin America (particularly Brazil) and Asia Pacific (including China, India, Southeast Asia and Australia) represent a significant growth opportunity for us. We believe there are ample opportunities for additional licensee, franchisee and distributor locations.



Heritage Brands Business



Our Heritage Brands business is an important complement to our global designer brand businesses. We believe that this business can continue to grow and generate healthy cash flows as we implement our key strategic initiatives, which include:



Brand Management.Across our Heritage Brands portfolio, we are committed to designing and marketing quality, trend-right products that offer great value to our customers. To help communicate our brand messaging to consumers, we invest in our brands through marketing, advertising and in-store point of sale material. We believe that these marketing techniques drive traffic and enhance the image and desirability of our brands.



Leveraging and enhancing each division’s positioning in the market.This includes:

•Dress Furnishings —  We operate the world’s largest dress shirt and neckwear business. We are focused on maintaining and expanding our positioning as we introduce innovative new styles and designs. Across our businesses, we are continually evaluating new brand licensing opportunities, which will allow us to leverage our strong established platforms in the dress furnishings category.

•Sportswear — Across our sportswear offerings, we are focused on elevating our products through quality, detailing and fashion. Brand specific initiatives exist as well. ForIZOD, we seek to expand our offerings at Kohl’s Corporation, grow our golf business and continue to invest in in-store branding and new shop presentations. ForVan HeusenandARROW,we are focused on strengthening our position in the mid-tier department stores, reinforcing the value equation for each brand and growing through cross-channel expansion.

•Core Intimates — We see a healthy path of growth forWarner’s andOlga. Within our existing wholesale presentations, we have been investing in enhanced fixtures, signage and additional marketing support. These investments have led to improved sell-throughs, as they have helped elevate our brand perception with consumers and showcase our products more effectively. We also believe that we can expand our distribution, particularly within the mass channel and throughout Mexico (primarily across mass retailers).

•Swim —  GivenSpeedo’s strong reputation in the world of competitive swimming, we plan to continually innovate and extend our product offerings of swimwear and swim products. We also see potential to broaden the brand’s customer base and relevance beyond the competitive swimmer population to reach more general fitness and recreational consumers. We look to leverage opportunities around the 2016 Olympics to further fuel the business.



Channel mix.We believe that we can expand our distribution, particularly through:

•E-commerce — E-commerce is a notable focus area, as we seek to increase our presence within the e-commerce sites operated by our key department store partners, through pure-play e-tailers and through our directly operatedwww.speedousa.comwebsite. Through third party websites, we are focused on expanding our product offerings, raising their profile, and improving our sell-throughs. Within our directly operatedSpeedo USAwebsite, we are focused on generating higher traffic, enhancing our technologies and improving website navigation.

•Wholesale expansion — We believe that we can expand our penetration across key wholesale accounts by gaining market share, opening additional shop environments (including leveraging our recent launch ofIZODat Kohl’s and expandingARROWacross J.C. Penney Company, Inc. locations starting in Fall 2015) and expanding our product offerings.



International growth.We intend to expand the international distribution of our brands. To date, we have done so principally through licensing. We have approximately 45 international license agreements, covering approximately 165 territories outside of the United States, to use our heritage brands in numerous product categories, including apparel, accessories, footwear, soft home goods and fragrances. We also conduct international business directly, selling dress furnishings and sportswear products to department and specialty stores throughout Canada and operating a select few stores in Canada. We believe that our strong brand portfolio and broad product offerings enable us to seek additional growth opportunities in geographic areas where we believe we are underpenetrated, such as Europe, Asia and Latin America.












Other Strategic Opportunities



While we believe we have an attractive and diverse portfolio of brands with growth potential, we will continue to explore acquisitions of companies or trademarks and licensing opportunities that we believe are additive to our overall business. New license opportunities allow us to fill new product and brand portfolio needs. We take a disciplined approach to acquisitions, seeking brands with broad consumer recognition that we can grow profitably and expand by leveraging our infrastructure and core competencies and, where appropriate, by extending the brand through licensing.



Seasonality



Our business generally follows a seasonal pattern. Our wholesale businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the first and third quarters, while our retail businesses tend to generate higher levels of sales in the fourth quarter. Royalty, advertising and other revenue tends to be earned somewhat evenly throughout the year, although the third quarter has the highest level of royalty revenue due to higher sales by licensees in advance of the holiday selling season. We expect this seasonal pattern will generally continue.



Design



Our businesses depend on our ability to stimulate and respond to consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in the areas of quality and delivering a compelling price value proposition.



A significant factor in the continued strength of our brands is our in-house design teams. We form separate teams of designers and merchandisers for each of our brands, creating a structure that focuses on the special qualities and identity of each brand. These designers and merchandisers consider consumer taste and lifestyle and trends when creating a brand or product plan for a particular season. The process from initial design to finished product varies greatly but generally spans six to ten months prior to each retail selling season. Our product lines are developed primarily for two major selling seasons, Spring and Fall. However, certain of our product lines offer more frequent introductions of new merchandise.



Calvin Klein has a team of senior design directors who share a vision for theCalvin Kleinbrands and who each lead a separate design team. These teams control all design operations and product development for most licensees and other strategic partners.



Tommy Hilfiger seeks to reinforce the premium positioning of theTommy Hilfigerbrands by taking a coordinated and consistent worldwide approach to brand management. Products are adapted and executed on a regional basis in order to adjust for local or regional sizing, fits, weather, trends and demand. Tommy Hilfiger management believes that regional execution and adaptation helps it anticipate, identify and respond more readily to changing consumer demand, fashion trends and local tastes or preferences. It also reduces the importance of any one collection and enables the brand to appeal to a wider range of customers.



Product Sourcing



Our products were produced in over 1,300 factories and over 55 countries worldwide during 2014. With the exception of handmade and handfinished neckwear, which is made in our Los Angeles, California facility and accounted for less than 10% of our total quantity of neckwear sourced and produced, all of our products were produced by independent manufacturers located in foreign countries in Europe, the Far East, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, South America, the Caribbean, Central America and Africa. The manufacturers of our products are required to meet our quality, human rights, safety, environmental and cost requirements. No single supplier is critical to our production needs and we believe that an ample number of alternative suppliers exist should we need to secure additional or replacement production capacity and raw materials. We source finished products and raw materials. Raw materials include fabric, buttons, thread, labels and similar materials. Raw materials and production commitments are generally made two to six months prior to production, and quantities are finalized at that time. We believe we are one of the largest users of shirting fabric in the world. Finished products consist of manufactured and fully assembled products ready for shipment to our customers and our stores.





Our global supply chain teams, offices and buying agents enable us to monitor the quality of the goods manufactured by, and the delivery performance of, our suppliers, and work with our global compliance teams to ensure the enforcement of human rights and labor standards through our ongoing extensive training, approval and monitoring system. Our purchases from our suppliers are effected through individual purchase orders specifying the price, quantity, delivery date and destination of the items to be produced. Sales are monitored regularly at both the retail and wholesale levels and modifications in production can










be made either to increase or reduce inventories. We look to establish long-term supplier relationships in the appropriate locations throughout the world for our needs and place our orders in a manner designed to limit the risk a disruption of production at any one facility could cause a serious inventory problem while maximizing the business opportunity.



Tommy Hilfiger is a party to a nonexclusive agreement with Li & Fung Trading Limited under which Li & Fung performs most of Tommy Hilfiger’s sourcing work. Under the terms of the agreement, Tommy Hilfiger is required to use Li & Fung for at least 54% of its sourced products, or otherwise pay a penalty. Our Tommy Hilfiger business uses other third party buying offices for a portion of its sourced products and has a small in-house sourcing team that places orders directly with suppliers.

We are continuing to develop strategies and make investments in skill sets, locations and systems that enhance our ability to provide our customers with timely product availability and delivery. These investments are focused at allowing us to reduce the cycle time between the design of products and the delivery of those products to our customers while increasing service levels, reducing inventory exposure and improving quality and consumer value. We believe the enhancement of our supply chain efficiencies and working capital management through the effective use of our distribution network and overall infrastructure will allow us to better control costs and provide improved service to our customers.

The global supply chain teams monitor and track the primary cost inputs to the finished product to ensure that we pay the most appropriate cost for our finished goods. As our supply chain shifts from a single destination focus to a global distribution network, we continue to assess our manufacturing footprint to ensure we have the best infrastructure to meet the future needs of our global wholesale and retail businesses.



We are committed to the health, safety and well-being of the workers throughout our supply chain and to the integrity of our products. We actively work to educate our associates and partners and improve factory conditions, as well as continue to invest in the communities where we do business.

Corporate social responsibility underpins how we operate and engage with all of our stakeholders - from business partners to factory workers and consumers. Our steadfast belief in doing the right thing has been part of our core values, even as we have experienced rapid growth over the last decade. As an industry leader, we recognize the great responsibility and opportunity to make positive impacts — from source to store — by striving to preserve the environment, empower people and support communities in which we work and live.



Warehousing and Distribution



To facilitate distribution, our products are shipped from manufacturers to our wholesale and retail warehousing and distribution centers for inspection, sorting, packing and shipment. Centers range in size and are principally located in the United States in Arkansas, California, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Tennessee; and internationally in the Netherlands, Canada, China, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Taiwan, Brazil and Mexico. Our warehousing and distribution centers are designed to provide responsive service to our customers and our retail stores, as the case may be, on a cost-effective basis. This includes the use of various forms of electronic communications to meet customer needs, including advance shipping notices for certain customers.



We believe that our investments in logistics and supply chain management allow us to respond rapidly to changes in sales trends and consumer demands while enhancing inventory management. We believe our customers can better manage their inventories as a result of our continuous analysis of sales trends, broad array of product availability and quick response capabilities. Certain of our products can be ordered at any time through our EDI replenishment systems. For customers who reorder these products, we generally ship these products within one to two days of order receipt. At the end of 2014 and 2013, our backlog of customer orders totaled $1.136 billion and $1.473 billion, respectively.



Our largest customers account for significant portions of our revenue. Sales to our five largest customers were 21.8% of our revenue in 2014, 20.8% of our revenue in 2013 and 18.7% of our revenue in 2012. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue in 2014, 2013 or 2012.



Advertising and Promotion



We market our brands and products to target distinct consumer demographics and lifestyles. Our marketing programs are an integral feature of our brands and their associated product offerings. Advertisements generally portray a lifestyle rather than a specific item. We intend for each of our brands to be a leader in its respective market segment, with strong consumer awareness and consumer loyalty. We believe that our brands are successful in their respective segments because we have










strategically positioned each brand to target a distinct consumer demographic. We design and market our products to complement each other, satisfy lifestyle needs, emphasize product features important to our target consumers and encourage consumer loyalty.



We advertise our brands through digital media, including our e-commerce platforms and social media outlets, in order to expand our reach to customers and enable us to provide timely information in an entertaining fashion to consumers about our products, special events, promotions and store locations. In addition, we advertise through print media (including fashion, entertainment/human interest, business, men’s, women’s and sports magazines and newspapers), on television and through outdoor signage, as well as participate in cooperative advertising programs with our retail partners.



We also advertise our brands through sport sponsorships and product tie-ins. OurVan HeusenInstitute of Styleis a marketing and media campaign that ties in professional football through individual endorsement agreements with Pro Football Hall of Famers Steve Young and Jerry Rice. OurIZODbrand is represented by PGA golfer Webb Simpson and pro golfer Cameron Wilson. A number of world-class swimmers and divers, including Natalie Coughlin, Ryan Lochte, Jessica Hardy and Nathan Adrian, wearSpeedoproducts in competition and participate in various promotional activities on behalf of the brand.Calvin Kleinhas a sponsorship agreement with the Brooklyn Nets and the Barclays Center and we have an all-brand, regional sponsorship agreement with the New York Giants.



With respect to our North America retail operations, we generally rely upon local outlet mall developers to promote traffic for their centers. Outlet center developers employ multiple formats, including signage (highway billboards, off-highway directional signs, on-site signage and on-site information centers), print advertising (brochures, newspapers and travel magazines), direct marketing (to tour bus companies and travel agents), radio and television and special promotions.



We believeCalvin Kleinis one of the best known designer names in the world. Its high-profile, often cutting-edge global advertising campaigns have periodically garnered significant publicity, notoriety and conversation among customers and consumers, as well as within the fashion industry, and have helped to establish and maintain theCalvin Kleinname and image. Calvin Klein has a dedicated in-house advertising agency, with experienced creative and media teams that develop and execute a substantial portion of the institutional consumer advertising for products under theCalvin Kleinbrands and work closely with other Calvin Klein departments and business partners to deliver a consistent and unified brand message to the consumer.



The core of

Calvin Klein

includes its global marketing campaigns, which are designed to engage consumers through provocative, modern and iconic brand imagery. In 2014, Calvin Klein launched 360

○

marketing campaigns to raise the brand’s cultural and fashion relevance, including the successful

#mycalvins

campaign for

Calvin Klein Underwear

and

Calvin Klein Jeans

. This campaign, among several other high profile marketing efforts, led to a sharp increase in followers across social media platforms such as Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and Weibo in China, and resulted in

Women’s Wear Daily

highlighting

Calvin Klein

as one of the “winners” of the social media race during September’s New York Fashion Week. The campaign, which encouraged fans of the brand to share photographs of themselves in their favorite

Calvin Klein

items, drew interest from “Millennials,” adding to the aspirational, yet accessible, nature of the brand. Not only did the campaign drive consumer engagement, it was also commercially successful, as it drove incremental purchasing of

Calvin Klein Underwear

product across channels.

Calvin Klein’

s legacy of provocative marketing campaigns continues, with Justin Bieber being featured as the new face of

Calvin Klein Jeans

and

Calvin Klein Underwear

in Spring 2015. The campaign, which was announced in January 2015, will be featured in 20 countries and will capitalize on the success of the

#mycalvins

initiative, leveraging Justin Bieber’s 150+ million followers across social media, encouraging fans to discover and purchase our products.



Calvin Klein also has a dedicated in-house global communications team, which incorporates corporate communications, public relations, celebrity dressing and special events. This group coordinates many global events, including the Spring and FallCalvin Klein Collectionrunway shows in New York City and Milan, and oversees the dressing of celebrities for events, award ceremonies and film premieres.



We believe thatTommy Hilfigeris also one of the world’s most well-known designer brands. Tommy Hilfiger employs advertising, marketing and communications staff, including an in-house creative team, as well as outside agencies, to implement its global marketing and communications strategy across all channels of distribution. The Tommy Hilfiger marketing and communications team develops and coordinates Tommy Hilfiger advertising for all regions and product lines, licensees and regional distributors. Advertisements forTommy Hilfigerbrand products appear primarily in fashion and lifestyle magazines, newspapers, outdoor media and cinema and on television. We also have increased the digital and online focus of marketing for theTommy Hilfigerbrands. The marketing and communications team also coordinates selected personal appearances by Mr. Tommy Hilfiger, including at runway shows, brand events and flagship store openings as part of its efforts. Most of Tommy Hilfiger’s licensees and distributors are required to contribute a percentage of their net sales ofTommy Hilfiger










products, generally subject to minimum amounts, to the advertising and promotion of theTommy Hilfigerbrand and products. We maintain multiple showroom facilities and sales offices in Europe, North and South America and Asia forTommy Hilfiger. In addition, in January 2015, we launched an innovative digital sales showroom, located at Tommy Hilfiger’s global headquarters in the Netherlands, that is expected to enhance the sales experience for retailers. We launch significant brand advertising campaigns two times per year in Spring/Summer and Fall/Winter to provide maximum consumer visibility of the new seasonal collections and to support sell-through, such as the introduction of internationally renowned tennis star Rafael Nadal as the global brand ambassador for theTommy Hilfigerunderwear andTommy Hilfiger Tailoredcollections beginning in Fall 2015. In addition to offering a broad array ofTommy Hilfigerapparel and licensed products, Tommy Hilfiger’s website,www.tommy.com, also serves as a marketing vehicle to complement the ongoing development of theTommy Hilfigerlifestyle brands.



Trademarks



We own theCalvin Klein,Tommy Hilfiger,Van Heusen,IZOD, ARROW,Warner’s,OlgaandEaglebrands, as well as related trademarks (e.g., the interlocking“IZ”logo forIZODand theTommy Hilfigerflag logo and crest design) and lesser-known names. These trademarks are registered for use in each of the primary countries where our products are sold and additional applications for registration of these and other trademarks are made in jurisdictions to accommodate new marks, uses in additional trademark classes or additional categories of goods or expansion into new countries.



We beneficially own theCalvin Kleinmarks and derivative marks in all trademark classes and for all product categories through our ownership of Calvin Klein and Warnaco. Calvin Klein and Warnaco together own the Calvin Klein Trademark Trust, which is the sole and exclusive title owner of substantially all registrations of theCalvin Kleintrademarks. The sole purpose of the Trust is to hold these marks. Calvin Klein maintains and protects the marks on behalf of the Trust pursuant to a servicing agreement. The Trust licenses to Calvin Klein and Warnaco on an exclusive, irrevocable, perpetual and royalty-free basis the use of the marks.



Mr. Calvin Klein retains the right to use his name, on a non-competitive basis, with respect to his right of publicity, unless those rights are already being used in the Calvin Klein business. Mr. Klein has also been granted a royalty-free worldwide right to use theCalvin Kleinmark with respect to certain personal businesses and activities, such as motion picture, television and video businesses, a book business, writing, speaking and/or teaching engagements, non-commercial photography, charitable activities and architectural and industrial design projects, subject to certain limitations designed to protect the image and prestige of theCalvin Kleinbrands and to avoid competitive conflicts.



Mr. Tommy Hilfiger is prohibited in perpetuity from using, or authorizing others to use, theTommy Hilfigermarks (except for the use by Mr. Hilfiger of his name personally and in connection with certain specified activities). In addition, we are prohibited in perpetuity from selling products not ordinarily sold under the names of prestige designer businesses or prestige global lifestyle brands without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, from engaging in new lines of business materially different from such types of lines of business without Mr. Hilfiger’s consent, or from disparaging or intentionally tarnishing theTommy Hilfiger-related marks or Mr. Hilfiger’s personal name. Certain lines of business will not be considered “new lines of business” for purposes of the agreement, including apparel, fashion, eyewear, accessories, housewares, home and bedding products, personal care products, footwear, watches and leather goods.



Our trademarks are the subject of registrations and pending applications throughout the world for use on a variety of apparel, footwear and related products, and we continue to expand our worldwide usage and registration of new and related trademarks. In general, trademarks remain valid and enforceable as long as the marks continue to be used in connection with the products and services with which they are identified and, as to registered tradenames, the required registration renewals are filed. In markets outside of the United States, particularly those where products bearing any of our brands are not sold by us or any of our licensees or other authorized users, our rights to the use of trademarks may not be clearly established.



Our trademarks and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets and we vigorously seek to protect them on a worldwide basis against infringement. We are susceptible to others imitating our products and infringing on our intellectual property rights. This is especially the case with respect to theCalvin KleinandTommy Hilfigerbrands, as these brands enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition and their generally higher pricing provides significant opportunity and incentive for counterfeiters and infringers. We have a broad, proactive enforcement program that we believe has been generally effective in controlling the sale of counterfeit products in the United States and in major markets abroad.












Contingent Purchase Price Payments



In connection with our acquisition of Calvin Klein in 2003, we are obligated to pay Mr. Calvin Klein contingent purchase price payments based on a percentage of total worldwide net sales of products bearing any of the

Calvin Klein

brands with respect to sales made through February 12, 2018. Our obligation to make contingent purchase price payments to Mr. Klein is guaranteed by our domestic Calvin Klein subsidiaries and is secured by a pledge of all of the equity interests in our Calvin Klein subsidiaries and a first priority lien on substantially all of our domestic Calvin Klein subsidiaries’ assets. Events of default under the agreements governing the collateral for our contingent payment obligations to Mr. Klein include, but are not limited to (1) our failure to make payments to Mr. Klein when due, (2) covenant defaults, (3) cross-defaults to other indebtedness in excess of an agreed amount, (4) events of bankruptcy, (5) monetary judgment defaults and (6) a change of control, including the sale of any portion of the equity interests in our Calvin Klein subsidiaries. An event of default under those agreements would permit Mr. Klein to foreclose on his security interest in the collateral. In addition, if we fail to pay Mr. Klein a contingent purchase price payment when due and such failure to pay continues for 60 days or more after a final judgment by a court is rendered relating to our failure to pay, Mr. Klein will no longer be restricted from competing with us as he otherwise would be under the non-competition provisions contained in the purchase agreement related to our acquisition of Calvin Klein, although he would still not be able to use any of the

Calvin Klein

brands or any similar trademark in any competing business. Such contingent purchase price payments totaled $51 million, $53 million and $51 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.



We reacquired in 2011 the rights in India to theTommy Hilfigertrademarks that had been subject to a perpetual license previously granted to GVM. We are required to make annual contingent purchase price payments into 2016 (or, under certain circumstances, into 2017) based on a percentage of annual sales in excess of an agreed upon threshold ofTommy Hilfigerproducts in India. Such payments are subject to a $25 million aggregate maximum and are due within 60 days following each one year anniversary of the acquisition. We made contingent purchase price payments of $0.6 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.



Competition



The apparel industry is competitive as a result of its fashion orientation, mix of large and small producers, the flow of domestic and imported merchandise and the wide diversity of retailing methods. We compete with numerous domestic and foreign designers, brands, manufacturers and retailers of apparel, accessories and footwear.



We compete primarily on the basis of style, quality, price and service. Our business depends on our ability to stimulate consumer tastes and demands, as well as on our ability to remain competitive in these areas. We believe we are well-positioned to compete in the apparel industry. Our diversified portfolio of brands and products and our use of multiple channels of distribution have allowed us to develop a business that produces results which are not dependent on any one demographic group, merchandise preference, distribution channel or geographic region. We have developed a portfolio of brands that appeal to a broad spectrum of consumers. Our owned brands have long histories and enjoy high recognition and awareness within their respective consumer segments. We develop our owned and licensed brands to complement each other and to generate strong consumer loyalty. TheCalvin KleinandTommy Hilfigerbrands generally provide us with the opportunity to develop businesses that target different consumer groups at higher price points and in higher-end distribution channels than our heritage brands, as well as with significant global opportunities due to the worldwide recognition of the brands.



Imports and Import Restrictions












We seek to minimize our potential exposure to import related risks through, among other measures, adjustments in product design and fabrication, shifts of production among countries and manufacturers and geographical diversification of our sources of supply.



Environmental Matters



Our facilities and operations are subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. In addition, we may incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to the contamination of sites that we own or operate or previously owned or operated (including contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites, abutters or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous materials. We believe our operations are in compliance with the terms of all applicable laws and regulations.



Employees



As of February 1, 2015, we employed approximately 17,600 persons on a full-time basis and approximately 16,500 persons on a part-time basis. Approximately 5% of our employees were represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by five different unions. Additional persons, some represented by these five unions, are employed from time to time based upon our manufacturing schedules and retailing seasonal needs. Our collective bargaining agreements generally are for one to three-year terms. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.
