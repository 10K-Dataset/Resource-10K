Item 1.  Business



The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries (collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, “Allstate”). Allstate is primarily engaged in the property-liability insurance and life insurance business. It offers its products in the United States and Canada.

The Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Allstate’s strategy is to serve distinct customer segments with differentiated offerings.  The Allstate brand is widely known through the “You’re In Good Hands With Allstate®” slogan. Allstate is the 2ndlargest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of2014statutory direct premiums written according to A.M. Best. In addition, according to A.M. Best, it is the nation’s19thlargest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of2014ordinary life insurance in force and31stlargest on the basis of2014statutory admitted assets.

Allstate has four business segments:

•    Allstate Protection•    Discontinued Lines and Coverages•    Allstate Financial•    Corporate and Other

To achieve its goals in2016, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:

•better serve our customers through innovation, effectiveness and efficiency;

•achieve target economic returns on capital;

•grow insurance policies in force;

•proactively manage investments; and

•build and acquire long-term growth platforms.

In this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory financial information to assess our competitive position.



ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Total Allstate Protection premiums written were$30.87 billionin2015. Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 93% of Allstate’s2015consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this segment, we principally sell private passenger auto, homeowners, and other property-liability insurance products through agencies and directly through contact centers and the internet. These products are underwritten under the Allstate®, Esurance®and Encompass®brand names.

Our Unique StrategyConsumer Segments












Allstate serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (local advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral versus brand-sensitive).

•Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve customers who prefer local personalized advice and service and are brand-sensitive. The Allstate brand also sells specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road vehicle insurance policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial lines products for small business owners; roadside assistance products; and service contracts and other products sold in conjunction with auto lending and vehicle sales transactions. Allstate brand sales and service are supported through contact centers and the internet. In2015, the Allstate brand represented91%of the Allstate Protection segment’s written premium. In the U.S., we offer these Allstate brand products in approximately10,200locations through approximately 34,800 licensed producers including approximately10,400Allstate exclusive agencies and approximately24,400licensed sales professionals. We also offer these products through approximately2,100independent agencies that are primarily in rural areas in the U.S. In Canada, we offer Allstate brand products through approximately850employee producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).

•Esurance brand auto, homeowners, renter and motorcycle insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through contact centers and through select agents, including Answer Financial. Esurance serves self-directed, brand-sensitive customers. In2015, the Esurance brand represented5%of the Allstate Protection segment’s written premium.

•Encompass brand auto, homeowners, umbrella and other insurance products, sold predominantly in the form of a single annual household (“package”) policy, are distributed through independent agencies that serve consumers who prefer personal advice and assistance from an independent adviser and are brand neutral. Encompass targets mass affluent households, a market of approximately 35 million in the U.S., with higher average coverage needs. In2015, the Encompass brand represented4%of the Allstate Protection segment’s written premium. Encompass brand products are distributed through approximately2,300independent agencies. Encompass is among the top20largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information provided by A.M. Best for2014.

•Answer Financial, a personal lines insurance agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice between insurance carriers. It offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 25 insurance companies through its website and over the phone and receives commissions for this service.

Through arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers, the Allstate Protection segment may offer non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not available. As of December 31,2015, Allstate agencies had approximately$1.3 billionof non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related to property business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately$200 millionof non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. Answer Financial had$581 millionof non-proprietary premiums written in2015.

In the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally using customer value propositions for each consumer segment. This includes different brands, the scope and type of distribution system, price and the breadth of product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use sophisticated pricing algorithms to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base. For auto insurance, risk evaluation factors can include but are not limited to vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years insured with prior carrier; prior








liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance scoring utilizing certain credit report information. For property insurance, risk evaluation factors can include but are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history; age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and characteristics of the insured including insurance scoring utilizing certain credit report information.

Allstate differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the needs of the entire household and offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features through distribution channels that best suit each market segment. Allstate’s Your Choice Auto®insurance allows qualified customers to choose from a variety of options, such as Accident Forgiveness, Deductible Rewards®, Safe Driving Bonus®, and New Car Replacement. We believe that Your Choice Auto insurance promotes increased growth and increased retention. We also offer a Claim Satisfaction GuaranteeSMfeature that promises a return of premium to Allstate brand standard auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience. Allstate House and Home®insurance is our homeowners product that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. Good Hands RescueSMis a service that provides pay on demand access to roadside services.

Our Allstate branded Drivewise®and our Esurance branded DriveSense®offerings are telematic-based insurance programs that use a mobile application or an in-car device to capture driving behaviors and reward customers for driving safely. The Drivewise mobile application also provides customers with information and tools to encourage safer driving and incentivize them through driving challenges. Beginning in 2015, Drivewise offers Allstate Rewards®, a program that provides reward points for safe driving.

Our Esurance branded Pay Per Mile®usage-based insurance product was piloted in September 2015 and gives customers flexibility to customize their insurance and pay based on the number of miles they drive.

The Encompass package policy offers broad coverage options specifically tailored to the mass affluent market while simplifying the insurance experience by packaging a product into a single annual household policy with one premium, one bill, one policy deductible and one renewal date. Broad coverage options include features such as enhanced home replacement with a cash-out option should the insured decide not to rebuild, additional living expense coverage with no specific time or dollar limit, water-sewer back up coverage, an unlimited accident forgiveness feature and roadside assistance.

We sell Allstate Financial products through Allstate exclusive agencies and approximately1,000exclusive financial specialists, and 6,000 workplace enrolling independent agents.

New and additional deposits into these non-proprietary products were$1.9 billionin2015.

Competition

We compete on a wide variety of factors, including product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength and ratings, price, distribution and the level of customer service. The market for life insurance continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31,2014, there were approximately400groups of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31,2014, the Allstate Financial segment is the nation’s19thlargest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of2014ordinary life insurance in force and31stlargest on the basis of2014statutory admitted assets.

The market for voluntary benefits is growing as employers seek to shift benefit costs to employees.  Favorable industry and economic trends have increased competitive pressure and attracted new traditional and non-traditional entrants to the voluntary benefits market.  Recent entrants, including large group medical and life insurance carriers, are leveraging core benefit capabilities by bundling and discounting to capture voluntary market share.  Allstate will need to continue strengthening its value proposition and add new capabilities to maintain its strong leadership position in voluntary benefits.

Geographic Markets

We sell life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States. Through subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.

In addition, arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers allow Allstate exclusive agencies the ability to make available non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not available.

In the U.S., Allstate brand products are sold in approximately 10,200 locations through approximately 34,800 licensed producers including approximately10,400Allstate exclusive agencies employing approximately24,400licensed sales professionals, who are licensed to sell our products.

We pursue opportunities for growing Allstate brand exclusive agency distribution based on market opportunities.

We support our exclusive agencies in a variety of ways to facilitate customer service and Allstate’s overall growth strategy. For example, we offer assistance with marketing, sales, service and business processes and provide education and other resources to help them acquire more business and retain more customers. Our programs support exclusive agencies and help them grow by offering financing to acquire other agencies and awarding additional resources to better performing agencies. We support our relationship with Allstate exclusive agencies through several national and regional working groups:

•The Agency Executive Council, engages exclusive agencies on our customer service and growth strategy. Membership includes approximately 20 Allstate exclusive agency owners selected on the basis of performance, thought leadership and credibility among their peer group.

.

Allstate independent agent remuneration comprises a base commission (Property-Liability products) and a bonus which can be earned by agents who achieve a target loss ratio. The bonus, which is a percentage of premiums, is earned by achieving a targeted percentage of multi-category households (customers with Allstate policies in at least two of the following product categories: vehicle, personal property or life and retirement) and increased Allstate Protection (Allstate brand) net written premium above a minimum threshold. Other elements of independent agency compensation and support include marketing support payments, national and regional promotions and recognition trips based on achievement. There are no significant changes to the compensation framework planned for 2016.

Since Allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance, all Allstate brand customers who purchase their policies directly through contact centers and the internet are provided an Allstate agency relationship at the time of purchase.








To better serve customers who prefer local and personalized advice, we are undergoing a focused multi-year effort to position agents, licensed sales professionals and financial specialists to serve customers as trusted advisors. This means that they have a local presence that instills confidence; know their customers and understand the unique needs of their households; help them assess the potential risks they face; provide local expertise and personalized guidance on how to protect what matters most to them by offering customized solutions; and support them when they have changes in their lives and during their times of need. To ensure agencies have the resources, capacity and support needed to serve customers at this level, we are deploying education and support focused on relationship initiation and insurance and retirement expertise and are continuing efforts to enhance agency capabilities with customer-centric technology while simplifying and automating service processes to enable agencies to focus more time in an advisory role.

Allstate employs field sales leaders who are responsible for recruiting and retaining Allstate agents and helping them grow their business and profitability. The field sales leaders’ compensation is aligned with agency success and includes a bonus based on the level of agent remuneration described above and agency geographic footprint.

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE

The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

Reconciliation of Claims Reserves

The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

______________________________

(1)In2015, the gross change in provision attributable to prior years, primarily relate to increases in Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves.  In2014and2013, the gross change in provision attributable to prior years, primarily relate to increases for Michigan and New Jersey unlimited personal injury protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves (see the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A for additional discussion).

(2)Reserves for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $5.89 billion, $5.69 billion and $4.66 billion as of December 31,2015,2014and2013, respectively.

The year-end2015gross reserves of$23.87 billionfor property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $7.09 billion more than the net reserve balance of $16.78 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $5.89 billion, primarily related to the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”), that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $1.06 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.

As the tables above illustrate, Allstate’s net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of2014increased in2015by$81 million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of$152 million. Net reserve reestimates in2014and2013of$84 millionand$121 million, respectively, were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates which increased$925 millionand$1.25 billion, respectively, primarily due to Michigan personal injury protection claim reserves ceded to the MCCA.

Loss Reserve Reestimates

The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate’s expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable.




























The Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

As shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2005, in general, reflect additions to reserves in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced by Allstate Protection, as discussed more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to older years along with reserve strengthening as discussed below.

The following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year period ended December 31,2015. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are








applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses. The changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

In2015, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to severity development for bodily injury coverage for recent years that was more than expected. The increased reserves in accident years 2005 & prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment and litigation settlements from older years.

In 2014, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was better than expected. The increased reserves in accident years 2004 & prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In 2013, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The increased reserves in accident years 2003 & prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment and a reclassification of injury reserves to older years.

In 2012, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates. The increased reserves in accident years 2002 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In 2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In 2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In 2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008 non-injury reserves to older years.

In 2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates.

In 2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In 2006, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

In recent years, the state insurance regulatory framework has come under increased federal scrutiny. As part of an effort to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) was enacted in 2010. Some regulations required pursuant to this law must still be finalized and, until such time, we are unable to determine the impact on Allstate’s operations. Dodd-Frank also created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). The FIO monitors the insurance industry, provides advice to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), represents the U.S. on international insurance matters, and studies the current regulatory system. FIO submitted reports to Congress in 2013 and 2014 addressing how to improve and modernize the system of insurance regulation. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. We cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. We are working for changes in the regulatory environment to make insurance more available and affordable for consumers, encourage market innovation, improve driving safety, strengthen cybersecurity, and promote better catastrophe preparedness and loss mitigation.

Additional regulations or new requirements may emerge from activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”), that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. In addition, the NAIC has adopted amendments to its model holding company law, which have been adopted by some jurisdictions. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies. Additional discussion of recent developments enabled by Dodd-Frank appear later in this section.

Agent and Broker Compensation.In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. Agents and brokers in New York are required to disclose certain information concerning compensation.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation – Change of Control.








notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay, or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation’s common stock.

Rate Regulation.Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.

The speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator’s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.

An insurer’s ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer’s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

From time to time, the personal lines insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs, catastrophe loss exposure, and expenses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models and rating plans that are reviewed by regulators and special interest groups. State regulators may interpret existing law or rely on future legislation or regulations to impose new restrictions that adversely affect profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rating.

Involuntary Markets.As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.

Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association.

The MCCA is a mandatory insurance coverage and reinsurance indemnification mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year. It operates similar to a reinsurance program and is funded by participating member companies through a per vehicle annual assessment that is currently $150. This assessment is collected when we receive payment from our customers and we remit the assessment to the MCCA. The participating company retention level is

$545 thousand

New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association.The New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (“PLIGA”) provides reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in excess of $75,000 with no limits for policies issued or renewed prior to January 1, 1991, and paid in excess of $75,000 and capped at $250,000 for policies issued or renewed from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2004. As the statutory administrator of the Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund (“UCJF”), PLIGA also provides compensation to qualified claimants for personal injury protection, bodily injury, or death caused by private passenger automobiles operated by uninsured or “hit and run” drivers. The








UCJF also provides private passenger stranger pedestrian personal injury protection benefits when no other coverage is available. A significant portion of the incurred claim reserves and the recoverable can be attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims.  PLIGA annually assesses all admitted property and casualty insurers writing motor vehicle liability insurance in New Jersey for direct PLIGA expenses and UCJF reimbursements and expenses. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact from PLIGA or the UCJF on Allstate.

Guaranty Funds.Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact on Allstate from these assessments.

National Flood Insurance Program.

Investment Regulation.Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit the amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.Most states regulate an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer’s ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities with market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”).

Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators. In April 2015, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a proposed regulation that would, if finalized in its current form, expand the range of activities that would be considered to be “investment advice” and establish a new framework for determining whether a person is a fiduciary when mutual funds or variable annuities are sold in connection with an Individual Retirement Account or an employee benefit plan covered under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended. If enacted in its current form, the proposed regulation could have an adverse impact on the products that Allstate’s broker-dealer, Allstate Financial Services, LLC (“AFS”), will be able to provide and will add costs to AFS business operations to comply with these new requirements. Because we cannot predict the exact nature and extent of changes that may be made to the proposed regulation when finalized, the potential effect on AFS’s business is undeterminable at this time.

Dodd-Frank.The Secretary of the Treasury (operating through FIO) and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) are jointly authorized, pursuant to Dodd-Frank, to negotiate a Covered Agreement with one or more foreign governments, authorities, or regulatory entities.  A Covered Agreement is a written bilateral or multilateral agreement that “relates to the recognition of prudential measures with respect to the business of insurance or reinsurance that achieves a level of protection for insurance or reinsurance consumers that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection achieved under State insurance or reinsurance regulation.” A Covered Agreement would become effective 90 days after FIO and USTR jointly submit the final agreement to the House Financial Services, House Ways and Means, Senate Banking, and Senate Finance committees.  The House and Senate committees are not required to vote on the Covered Agreement for it to become effective.  As provided in Dodd-Frank, a Covered Agreement cannot preempt state insurance measures that govern an insurer’s rates, premiums, underwriting or sales practices; any state insurance coverage requirements; the application of antitrust laws of any state to the business of insurance; or








any state insurance measure governing insurer capital or solvency, except where a state insurance measure results in less favorable treatment of a non-U.S. insurer than a U.S. insurer.

In November 2015, pursuant to Dodd-Frank, Treasury and USTR notified Congress that they were formally initiating negotiations on a Covered Agreement with the European Union (“EU”) addressing: permanent equivalence treatment of the U.S. regulatory system by the EU; confidential sharing of information across jurisdictions; and uniform treatment of EU-based reinsurers operating in the U.S., including with respect to reinsurance collateral.  In the absence of an equivalence determination by the EU, U.S. based insurers with subsidiaries in the EU may be required to comply with European group capital and group supervision requirements for their U.S. operations. Once effective, the Covered Agreement would pre-empt state laws relating to reinsurance collateral if they “result in less favorable treatment of a non-United States insurer domiciled in a foreign jurisdiction that is subject to a covered agreement than a United States insurer domiciled, licensed, or otherwise admitted in that State.”

The NAIC amended its Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation on November 6, 2011 (“Revised Reinsurance Model Law”), and statutory and regulatory enactments implementing these amendments have passed in 32 states.  These amendments establish a new category of “certified reinsurers,” allowing domestic insurers to receive statutory capital credit for reinsurance ceded to certified reinsurers absent the reinsurers fully collateralizing their assumed reinsurance obligations. Under the NAIC’s previous regulatory scheme, which was utilized by all 50 states, and currently remains in effect in Illinois, domestic ceding companies are not allowed to take statutory capital credit for reserves ceded to unauthorized reinsurers unless the insurer withholds funds due to the reinsurer in an amount equal to the reserves, obtains a letter of credit on behalf of the unauthorized reinsurer equal to the amount of the reserves, or is the beneficiary of a credit for reinsurance trust with assets equal to the amount of the reserves.

The state insurance regulators have general authority over the business of insurance, including the determination of statutory capital credit allowed to domestic insurers utilizing reinsurance.  In their November 2015 letters to Congress, Treasury and USTR indicated that they “support the integrated system of state and federal insurance regulation, including the primary role of state insurance regulators as supervisors of the business of insurance.  Treasury and USTR will not enter into a Covered Agreement with the EU unless the terms of that agreement are beneficial to the United States.  State insurance regulators will have a meaningful role during the Covered Agreement negotiating process.”

If executed as described by the FIO and USTR, the Covered Agreement could possibly secure permanent equivalence treatment of the U.S. regulatory system by the EU and eliminate reinsurance collateral requirements for EU-based foreign reinsurers in all States.

Privacy Regulation.Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of customer information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.

Asbestos.Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past and, recently, the House of Representatives passed the Furthering Asbestos Claims Transparency Act.  The Act is designed to enable asbestos trust funds to pay only those who are entitled by law to compensation from the funds. Favorable action in the Senate and a presidential approval are uncertain. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.
