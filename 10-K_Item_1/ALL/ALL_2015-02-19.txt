Item 1.  Business

The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries
(collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the property-liability insurance and life insurance business. It offers its products in the United
States and Canada.

The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate's strategy is to reinvent protection and retirement to help consumers protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Allstate is the 2ndlargest personal
property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2013 statutory direct premiums earned according to A.M. Best. In addition, according to A.M. Best, it is the nation's
16thlargest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2013 ordinary life insurance in force and 29thlargest on the basis of 2013 statutory admitted
assets.

Allstate
has four business segments:

•Allstate Protection•Discontinued Lines and Coverages•Allstate Financial•Corporate and Other



To
achieve its goals in 2015, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:

•grow insurance policies in force;•maintain the underlying combined ratio;•proactively manage investments to generate attractive risk adjusted returns;•modernize the operating model; and•build long-term growth platforms.

In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory
financial information to assess our competitive position.

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Total Allstate Protection premiums written were $29.61 billion in 2014. Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 93% of
Allstate's 2014 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this segment, we principally sell private passenger auto and homeowners insurance through agencies and directly through contact
centers and the internet. These products are underwritten under the Allstate®, Esurance® and Encompass® brand names.

Our Unique StrategyConsumer Segments











Allstate
serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (local advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral versus
brand-sensitive).

•

Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve customers who
prefer local personalized advice and service and are brand-sensitive. The Allstate brand also sells specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road vehicle insurance
policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial lines products for small business owners; roadside
assistance products; and service contracts and other products sold in conjunction with auto lending and vehicle sales transactions. Allstate brand sales and service are supported through contact
centers and the internet. In 2014, the Allstate brand represented 91% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. In the U.S., we offer these Allstate brand products through approximately
10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations with approximately 23,200 licensed sales professionals. We also offer these products through approximately 2,000 independent
agencies that are primarily in rural areas in the U.S. In Canada we offer Allstate brand products through approximately 750 employee producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario,
Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).

•

Esurance brand auto, homeowners, renter and motorcycle insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through contact
centers and through select agents, including Answer Financial. Esurance serves self-directed, brand-sensitive customers. In 2014, the Esurance brand represented 5% of the Allstate Protection segment's
written premium.

•

Encompass brand auto, homeowners, umbrella and other insurance products, sold predominantly in the form of a single annual household
("package") policy, are distributed through independent agencies that serve consumers who prefer personal advice and assistance from an independent adviser and are brand neutral. Encompass targets
approximately 35 million mass affluent households (consumers with $100,000 - $500,000 in household income and net worth greater than $150,000) in the U.S., with their higher average
premiums and preference for professional advice regarding coverage needs and risk solutions. In 2014, the Encompass brand represented 4% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. Encompass
brand products are distributed through approximately 2,400 independent agencies. Encompass is among the top 15 largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through
independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information provided by A.M. Best for 2013.

•

Answer Financial, an independent personal lines insurance
agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice
between insurance carriers. It offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 25 insurance companies through its website and over the phone and receives commissions for
this service.

Through
arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers, the Allstate Protection segment may offer non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not
available. As of December 31, 2014, Allstate agencies had approximately $1.3 billion of non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related to property
business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $160 million of
non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. Answer Financial had $526 million of non-proprietary premiums written in 2014.

In
the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally using customer value propositions for each consumer segment. This includes different brands, the scope and
type of distribution system, price and the breadth of product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of
underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use sophisticated pricing algorithms to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base.

The
primary focus of our sophisticated pricing methods has been on acquiring and retaining profitable business. Sophisticated pricing and underwriting methods use a number of risk
evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years
insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance scoring utilizing certain credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but
are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history; age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring utilizing
certain credit report information.

Allstate
differentiates itself from competitors by focusing on the needs of the entire household and offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features through
distribution channels that best suit each market segment. Allstate's Your Choice Auto® insurance allows qualified customers to choose from a variety of options, such as Accident
Forgiveness, Deductible Rewards®, Safe Driving Bonus®, and New Car Replacement. We believe that Your Choice Auto insurance promotes increased growth and increased retention. We
also offer a Claim Satisfaction Guaranteesmfeature that promises a return of premium to Allstate brand standard auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience.
Allstate House and Home® insurance is our homeowners product that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. Good
Hands® Roadside Assistance is a service that provides pay on demand access to roadside services.

Our
Allstate branded Drivewise® and Esurance DriveSense® offerings are usage-based insurance programs that use an in-car device or a mobile application to capture
driving behaviors and reward customers for driving safely. We are also testing additional features that extend the benefits of being connected beyond auto insurance pricing. The recently introduced
Star Driver® program encourages an ongoing conversation about safe driving through an easy-to-use application to develop teens' confidence behind the wheel. The Esurance
DriveSafe® program is designed to help parents coach teens on safe driving by providing customizable driving statistics and the ability to limit cell phone use while the car is in motion,
all controlled by a device installed in the vehicle.

The
Encompass package policy simplifies the insurance experience by packaging a product with broader coverage and higher limits into a single annual household policy with one premium,
one bill, one policy deductible and one renewal date.

Geographic Markets

The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners, and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States.
Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell
personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada.

annuity account balances under management. New and additional deposits into these non-proprietary products were $1.9 billion in 2014.

Competition

We compete on a wide variety of factors, including product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength and ratings, price,
distribution and the level of customer service. The market for life insurance continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2013, there were approximately 400 groups of
life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2013, the Allstate Financial segment is the
nation's 16thlargest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2013 ordinary life insurance in force and 29thlargest on the basis of
2013 statutory admitted assets.

Geographic Markets

We sell life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States. Through subsidiaries, we are
authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. Beginning in 2015, we also intend to sell voluntary
accident and health insurance in Canada.

ALLSTATE EXCLUSIVE AGENCIES

Allstate exclusive agencies offer for sale products targeted to consumers that prefer local personalized advice and branded products
from both the Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial segments. They offer Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance policies; specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home
and off-road vehicle insurance policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial products for small
business owners; and roadside assistance products. Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists offer various life insurance products, as well as voluntary accident and health
insurance products. In addition, arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers allow Allstate exclusive agencies the ability to make available non-proprietary products to consumers
when an Allstate product is not available.

In
the U.S., Allstate brand products are sold through approximately 10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,800 locations. In addition, these agencies employ approximately
23,200 licensed sales professionals who are licensed to sell our products. We also offer these products through approximately 2,000 independent agencies in primarily rural areas in the U.S. In Canada
we offer Allstate brand products through approximately 750 producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia). We pursue opportunities for
growing Allstate brand exclusive agency distribution based on market opportunities.

We
support our exclusive agencies in a variety of ways to facilitate customer service and Allstate's overall growth strategy. For example, we offer assistance with marketing, sales,
service and business processes and provide education and other resources to help them acquire more business and retain more customers. Our programs support exclusive agencies and help them grow by
offering financing to acquire other agencies and awarding additional resources to better performing agencies. We support our relationship with Allstate exclusive agencies through several national and
regional working groups:

•The Agency Executive Council, led by Allstate's senior leadership, engages exclusive agencies on our customer service and growth
strategy. Membership includes approximately 20 Allstate exclusive agency owners selected on the basis of performance, thought leadership and credibility among their peer group.•The
National Advisory Board brings together Allstate's senior leadership and a cross section of Allstate exclusive agents and
exclusive financial specialists from around the country to address national business issues and develop solutions.•Regional Advisory Boards support Allstate exclusive agency owner
engagement within each of Allstate's 15 regional offices in the U.S.
and within Canada.









Since
Allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance, all Allstate brand customers who purchase their policies directly through contact centers and the internet are
provided an Allstate agency relationship at the time of purchase.

To
better serve customers who prefer local and personalized advice we are undergoing a focused effort to position agents, licensed sales professionals and financial specialists to serve
customers as trusted advisors. This means they know customers and understand the unique needs of their households, help them assess the potential risks they face and provide personalized guidance on
how to protect what matters most to them. To ensure agencies have the resources, capacity and support needed to serve customers at this level, we have efforts underway to enhance agency capabilities
while simplifying and automating service processes to enable agencies to focus more time in an advisory role.

Allstate
employs field sales leaders who are responsible for recruiting and retaining Allstate agents and helping them grow their business and profitability. The field sales leaders'
compensation is aligned with agency success and includes a bonus based on the level of agent remuneration described above and agency geographic footprint.

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations. Note 19 of the
consolidated financial statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment over the last three
years.

the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection and our
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segments. Note 19 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE

The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate
Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

Reconciliation of Claims Reserves

The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense
reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of









Financial
Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(1)The
Esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in 2012 resulting in a reduction in reserves due to lower severity. The
adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio.(2)In
2014, 2013 and 2012, the gross change in provision attributable to prior years, primarily relate to increases for Michigan and New Jersey
unlimited personal injury protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves (see the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section for additional discussion).(3)In
2013, the net change in provision attributable to prior years decreased $544 million compared to 2012, primarily due to lower
catastrophe reserve reestimates.(4)Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $5.69 billion, $4.66 billion and $4.01 billion as of
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

The
year-end 2014 gross reserves of $22.92 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were $7.00 billion more than the
net reserve balance of $15.93 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance
recoverables from third parties totaling $5.69 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the
Canadian subsidiaries for $1.14 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.









As the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2013 decreased in 2014 by
$84 million, compared to reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $925 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2014, 2013 and 2012 were more favorable than the gross reserve
reestimates due to reinsurance cessions.

Loss Reserve Reestimates

The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect
to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's
expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and
indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation
period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable.

The
Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the
current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

As
shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general, reflect additions to reserves in the
Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced by Allstate Protection, as discussed
more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years attributable to a reallocation of
reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to older years along with reserve strengthening
as discussed below.

The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year
period ended December 31, 2014. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are
applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve reestimates are shown in
this table in parentheses. The changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing
suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

In
2014, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was better than expected. The increased reserves in accident years 2004 &
prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In
2013, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2003 & prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment and a reclassification of injury reserves to older years.

In
2012, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates. The
increased reserves in accident years 2002 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of
injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.









In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008 non-injury
reserves to older years.

In
2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates.

In
2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages
segment.

In
2006 and 2005, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what was
anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in 2006, also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than
offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These
rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster
licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of
dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory
financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements.
Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Additional
regulations or new requirements may emerge from activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, the National Association of
Insurance Commissioners ("NAIC"), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors ("IAIS"), that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. In addition, the
NAIC has proposed amendments to their model holding company law, which has not yet been adopted by any jurisdiction. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an
increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies.

Agent and Broker Compensation.In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents
and
brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. Agents and brokers in New York
are required to disclose certain information concerning compensation.









Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt.
Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see
Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in
some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation – Change of Control.

Rate Regulation.Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.

The
speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval,
(ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws,
the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to
file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the
regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.

An
insurer's ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or
proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer
can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a rate that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure, particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss
costs from high levels of catastrophe losses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models that are being
reviewed by regulators and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of
possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rating.









Involuntary Markets.As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.

Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association.

New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund.The New Jersey Unsatisfied Claim and Judgment Fund ("NJUCJF") provides compensation to
qualified
claimants for bodily injury or death caused by private passenger automobiles operated by uninsured or "hit and run" drivers. The fund also provides reimbursement to insurers for the medical benefits
portion of personal injury protection coverage paid in excess of $75,000 with no limits for policies issued or renewed prior to January 1, 1991 and in excess of $75,000 and capped at $250,000
for policies issued or renewed from January 1, 1991 to December 31, 2004. NJUCJF expenses are assessed on companies writing motor vehicle liability insurance in New Jersey annually based
on their private passenger and commercial automobile written premiums. The NJUCJF was merged into the New Jersey Property Liability Guaranty Association who collects the assessments. We do not
anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on Allstate.

Guaranty Funds.Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.

National Flood Insurance Program.We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").
The NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the
Standard Flood Insurance Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States
Treasury. We receive expense allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management and commissions and are reimbursed for adjuster fees. The federal government is obligated to
pay all claims that fall under the arrangement.

Investment Regulation.Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus.
Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a
market. For example, states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of
insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans
to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the









federal
and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").

Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators.

Privacy Regulation.Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and
confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities
are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.

Asbestos.Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but sufficient support among various
defendant
and insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.
