Item 1.  Business

The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and their affiliates (collectively,
including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the personal property and casualty insurance business and the life insurance, retirement and investment products
business. It conducts its business primarily in the United States.

The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate is reinventing protection and retirement to help individuals in approximately 16 million households protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Customers can access
Allstate products and services such as auto and homeowners insurance through 11,200 exclusive Allstate agencies and financial representatives in the United States and Canada, as well as through
independent agencies, call centers and the internet. Allstate is the 2ndlargest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2011 statutory direct
premiums earned. In addition, according to A.M. Best, it is the nation's 16thlargest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2011 ordinary life insurance in force and
23rdlargest on the basis of 2011 statutory admitted assets.

Allstate
has four business segments:

•Allstate
Protection•Discontinued Lines and
Coverages•Allstate
Financial•Corporate and
Other

To
achieve its goals in 2013, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:

•grow insurance premiums;•maintain auto profitability;•raise returns in
homeowners and annuity businesses;•proactively manage investments; and•reduce our cost structure.

In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory financial information to assess our competitive position.

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Total Allstate Protection premiums written were $27.03 billion in 2012. Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 92% of
Allstate's 2012 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this segment, we principally sell private passenger auto and homeowners insurance through agencies and directly through call
centers and the internet. These products are marketed under the Allstate®, Encompass®, and Esurance® brand names.

Our Unique Strategy









Allstate
serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral
versus brand-sensitive).

•

Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve
customers who prefer local personal advice and service and are brand-sensitive. Allstate brand sales and service are supported through call centers and the internet. In 2012, the Allstate brand
represented 92% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. In the U.S., we offer these Allstate brand products through approximately 9,300 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately
9,000 locations. We also offer these products through approximately 1,800 independent agencies in primarily rural areas in the U.S. In Canada we offer Allstate brand products through
approximately 670 producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).

•

Encompass brand auto and homeowners insurance products,
 largely sold in the form of a package policy, are sold through
independent agencies and serve customers who prefer personal service and support primarily from an independent agent and are brand-neutral. In 2012, the Encompass brand represented 4% of the Allstate
Protection segment's written premium. In the U.S., we sell Encompass brand products through approximately 2,800 independent agencies. Encompass is among the top 15 largest providers of personal
property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information provided by A.M. Best for 2011.

•

Esurance
brand auto insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through call centers and through select
agents, including Answer Financial, and serve self-directed, brand-sensitive customers. In 2012, the Esurance brand represented 4% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium.

•

Answer Financial, an independent personal lines insurance agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral
consumers who want a choice between insurance carriers and offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 20 insurance companies through its website and over the phone
and receives fee income for this service.

The
Allstate Protection segment also produces and sells specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road vehicle insurance policies; specialty
property products including renter, landlord, boat, umbrella, manufactured home and condominium insurance policies; roadside assistance products; guaranteed automobile protection and vehicle service
products sold primarily through auto dealers; and commercial products for small business owners. We also participate in the involuntary or shared private passenger auto insurance business in order to
maintain our licenses to do business in many states.

Through
arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers, the Allstate Protection segment offers non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product
is not available. As of December 31, 2012, Allstate agencies had approximately $1.2 billion of non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related
to property business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $140 million of non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. In addition, Esurance had
$26 million of non-proprietary premiums written in 2012, primarily related to homeowners and motorcycle insurance that Esurance does not currently offer and renters insurance that
Esurance does not offer in all states. Answer Financial had $442 million of non-proprietary premiums written in 2012.

Competition

The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the
market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2011 (the most recent date such competitive information is available) according
to A.M. Best.

In
the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our distribution system, price, the breadth of
our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use
sophisticated pricing to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base.

Our
sophisticated pricing and related underwriting and marketing programs use a number of risk evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to
vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance
scoring based on credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history;
age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring based on credit report information.

Our
primary focus in using sophisticated pricing methods has been on acquiring and retaining profitable business. The aim has been to enhance Allstate's competitive position with respect
to "target" market segments while maintaining or improving profitability. "Target customers" generally refers to consumers who want to purchase multiple products from one insurance provider including
auto, homeowners and financial products, who have better retention and potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us. We provide and
continue to enhance a range of discounts to attract more target customers. For example, we discount auto insurance to attract and retain target customers. In many states, we discount homeowners
insurance for customers who insure their automobiles with Allstate.

Allstate
differentiates itself from competitors by offering a comprehensive range of innovative product options and features. Allstate's Your Choice Auto® insurance allows
qualified customers to choose from a
variety of options, such as accident forgiveness, safe driving deductible rewards and a safe driving bonus. We believe that Your Choice Auto insurance promotes increased growth and increased
retention. We also offer a Claim Satisfaction Guaranteesmthat promises a return of premium to Allstate brand standard auto insurance customers dissatisfied with their claims experience.
Allstate House and Home® insurance is our new homeowners product that provides options of coverage for roof damage including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. Good
Hands® Roadside Assistance is a new service that provides pay on demand access to roadside services.

Geographic Markets

The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners, and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States.
Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell
personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment for 2012, based on information contained in
statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the premiums earned for the segment.

New York10.2%California9.9Texas9.5Florida8.0Pennsylvania5.4

We
continue to take actions to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce variability in our earnings. Accordingly, we expect to
continue to adjust underwriting practices with respect to our property business in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure.

Information regarding the last three years' revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Protection segment is
contained in Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 19 also includes information regarding the last three years' identifiable assets attributable to our

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Our Allstate Financial segment provides life insurance, voluntary accident and health insurance, and retirement and investment
products. Our principal products are interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; voluntary accident and health insurance; and fixed annuities including deferred and immediate. Our
institutional products, which we most recently offered in 2008, consist of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes issued to institutional
and individual investors. The table below lists our major distribution channels for this segment, with the associated products and targeted customers.

As
the table indicates, we sell Allstate Financial products to individuals through multiple intermediary distribution channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies and approximately
1,230 exclusive financial specialists, workplace
enrolling independent agents and independent master brokerage agencies, specialized structured settlement brokers, and directly through call centers and the internet.

Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists also sell the following non-proprietary products in addition to
Allstate Financial products: mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance. As of December 31, 2012, Allstate agencies have
approximately $8.5 billion of non-proprietary mutual funds and fixed and variable annuity account balances under management.

Competition

We compete on a wide variety of factors, including the type and level of service provided by distribution systems, product offerings,
the positioning of brands, financial strength and ratings, prices and the level of customer service. With regard to funding agreements, which we most recently offered in 2008, we compete principally
on the basis of our financial strength and ratings.

The
market for life insurance, retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2012, there were approximately
430 groups of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2011, the Allstate
Financial segment is the nation's 16thlargest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2011 ordinary life insurance in force and 23rdlargest on the
basis of 2011 statutory admitted assets. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms,
investment advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated
businesses, as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry.

Geographic Markets

We sell life insurance, voluntary accident and health insurance, and retirement and investment products throughout the United States.
Through subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. We also have sold funding
agreements in the United States.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for 2012, based on
information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the statutory premiums and annuity considerations.

ALLSTATE EXCLUSIVE AGENCIES

As described above, Allstate exclusive agencies offer for sale products related to both the Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial
segments. They offer Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance policies; specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road vehicle insurance policies;
specialty property products including renter, landlord, boat, umbrella, manufactured home and condominium insurance policies; roadside assistance products; and commercial products for small business
owners. Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists offer various life insurance and annuity products, as well as voluntary accident and health insurance products. In addition,
arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers allow Allstate exclusive agencies the ability to make available non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product
is not available.

In
the U.S., we sell these Allstate brand products through approximately 9,300 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,000 locations. In addition, these agencies employ
approximately 20,000 licensed sales professionals









who
are licensed to sell our products. We have strategies to assist agency owners of all sizes and tenure be successful. We are planning to grow the number of exclusive agencies following several
years of decline primarily resulting from agency consolidations and mergers, consistent with our prior plans. We pursue opportunities for growing Allstate brand exclusive agency distribution based on
demographic shifts and market conditions.

We
support exclusive agencies in a variety of ways to facilitate customer service and Allstate's overall growth strategy. For example, we offer assistance to Allstate exclusive agencies
with sales and business processes and we provide education and other resources to help them acquire more business and retain more customers. Our programs to support our exclusive agencies and help
them grow larger include offering financing to agents to acquire other agencies and awarding additional resources to better performing agencies. We support our relationship with Allstate exclusive
agencies through several national and regional working groups:

•The Agency Executive Council, led by Allstate's senior leadership, engages exclusive agencies on our customer service and
growth strategy. Membership includes 20 Allstate exclusive agency owners selected on the basis of performance, thought leadership and credibility among their peer group.•The National
Advisory Board brings together Allstate's senior leadership and a cross section of Allstate exclusive agents
and exclusive financial specialists from around the country to address national business issues and develop solutions.•Regional Advisory Boards support Allstate exclusive agency owner
engagement within each of Allstate's regional offices in
the U.S. and within Canada.

Allstate's
strategy is to help improve individual agency success, new business sales, customer satisfaction, retention and productivity. Allstate is striving to help develop stronger,
more valuable exclusive agencies with resources to build stronger customer relationships, provide differentiating levels of service by focusing on more complex customer needs, and support technology
that enables customer self-service for simpler needs.

Over
a two-year period that began in 2012, Allstate is transitioning to a new compensation structure for Allstate exclusive agencies. The structure rewards agencies for
delivering high value to our customers and achieving certain business outcomes such as product profitability, net growth and a diverse product mix. This cost neutral change will include a shift to a
higher proportion of variable compensation and bonus. In 2012, base commission rates remained unchanged, and the annual bonus was based on portfolio growth and household cross-sales. In 2013, a
portion of base commission will become variable compensation, focused on agency success factors and customer experience. Other elements of exclusive agency compensation and support include
start-up agency bonuses, marketing support payments, technology and data allowances, regional promotions and recognition trips based on achievement.

Since
Allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance, beginning in 2013 all Allstate brand customers who purchased their policies directly through call centers and the
internet will be assigned an Allstate exclusive agency relationship. We believe this will more effectively address customer needs while not significantly increasing costs.

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations.
Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment
over the last three years.

Our
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in
run-off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is presented in this segment. Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements contains
information for the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection
segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 19 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE

The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate
Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

Reconciliation of Claims Reserves

The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense
reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of









Financial
Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(1)Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $4.01 billion, $2.59 billion and $2.07 billion as of
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.(2)The
Esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in 2012 resulting in a reduction in reserves due to lower severity. The
adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio.

The year-end 2012 gross reserves of $21.29 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined
under GAAP, were $5.31 billion more than the net reserve balance of $15.98 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory
authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $4.01 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP
reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $1.09 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.

As
the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2011 decreased in 2012 by $665 million, compared to
reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $179 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance
cessions.









Loss Reserve Reestimates

The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original
recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section
compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also
presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable.

The
Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the
current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

As shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general,
reflect additions to reserves in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced
by Allstate Protection, as discussed more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years
attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to
older years along with reserve strengthening as discussed below.

The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the
ten-year period ended December 31, 2012. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which
the reestimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve
reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses. Since December 31, 2003, the changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation
filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

In 2012, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than
anticipated in previous estimates. The increased reserves in accident years 2002 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to the litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of
injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008
non-injury reserves to older years.









In
2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates.

In
2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages
segment.

In
2006, 2005 and 2004, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what
was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in 2006, also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages
segment.

In
2003, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines, partially offset by favorable Allstate Protection
auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates.

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. In
general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters,
including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims
practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and
corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a
discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Agent and Broker Compensation.In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding
the compensation of agents and brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers.
Agents and brokers in New York are required to disclose certain information concerning compensation.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt.
Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see
Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other









jurisdictions
that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation.

Rate Regulation.Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.

The
speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval,
(ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer
may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory
authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states,
including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.

An
insurer's ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or
proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer
can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a rate that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure, particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss
costs from high levels of catastrophe losses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and rating has
been the subject of challenges and investigations by regulators, legislators, and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the
Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rating.

Involuntary Markets.As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.









Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association.The Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA") is a mandatory insurance coverage and
reinsurance
reimbursement mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year. The retention level is
$500 thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2013 and 2012. It operates similar to a reinsurance
program and is funded through a portion of insurance premiums but may not be funded on an actuarial basis and can accumulate unfunded claims liabilities. As required for a member company, we report
covered paid and unpaid claims to the MCCA, when estimates of loss for a reported claim exceed the retention. The MCCA reimburses members as claims are paid and billed by members to the MCCA. Because
of the nature of the coverage, losses may be paid over the lifetime of an insured, accordingly, significant levels of incurred but not reported claims reserves ("IBNR") are recorded by member
companies as well as offsetting reinsurance recoverables. By statute, the MCCA is funded by assessments from member companies who, in turn, can recover assessments from policyholders. The MCCA has
unfunded claims liabilities with a reimbursement payable to its members. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on Allstate.

Guaranty Funds.Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.

National Flood Insurance Program.We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP"). The
NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the
Standard Flood Insurance Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States
Treasury. We receive expense allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management, commissions and adjuster fees. The federal government is obligated to pay all claims that fall
under the arrangement.

Investment Regulation.Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of
measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example,
states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance
business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans
to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").

Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators.

Privacy Regulation.Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and
confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities
are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.

Asbestos.Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but unified support among various
defendant and
insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.

Environmental.Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration
of waste sites by Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or "ECLs") establish a
