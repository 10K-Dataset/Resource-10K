Item 1.  Business

The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and their affiliates (collectively, including The
Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the personal property and casualty insurance business and the life insurance, retirement and investment products business. It
conducts its business primarily in the United States.

The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate is reinventing protection and retirement to help individuals in approximately 16 million households protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Customers can access
Allstate products and services such as auto insurance and homeowners insurance through more than 13,000 exclusive Allstate agencies and financial representatives in the United States and Canada.
Allstate is the 2ndlargest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2009 statutory direct premiums earned. In addition, according
to A.M. Best, it is the nation's 16thlargest
issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2009 ordinary life insurance in force and 21stlargest on the basis of 2009 statutory admitted assets.

Allstate
has four business segments:

•Allstate Protection•Discontinued Lines and Coverages•Allstate Financial•Corporate and Other

To achieve its goals in 2011, Allstate is focused on three priorities:

•improve our operating results;•grow our businesses profitably; and•differentiate ourselves from the competition by reinventing our business.

In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory
financial information to assess our competitive position.

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 92% of Allstate's 2010 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this
segment, we sell principally private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, primarily through agencies. These products are marketed under the Allstate and Encompass® brand names. The
Allstate Protection segment also includes a separate organization called Emerging Businesses which comprises Business Insurance (commercial products for small business owners), Consumer Household
(specialty products including motorcycle, boat, renters and condominium insurance policies), Allstate Dealer Services (insurance and non-insurance products sold primarily to auto dealers),
Allstate Roadside Services (retail and wholesale roadside assistance products) and Ivantage (insurance agency). We also participate in the involuntary or shared private passenger auto insurance
business in order to maintain our licenses to do business in many states. In some states, Allstate exclusive agencies offer non-proprietary property insurance products.

Allstate
brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and, to a lesser extent, through independent agencies in areas not served by
exclusive agencies. Encompass brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold through independent agencies.

In
most states, consumers can also purchase certain Allstate brand personal insurance products, and obtain service, through our direct channel that includes call centers and the
internet.

Total
Allstate Protection premiums written were $25.91 billion in 2010. Our broad-based network of approximately 11,500 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 10,850
locations in the U.S. produced approximately 87% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premiums in 2010. The direct channel accounted for 3% of this total. The rest was generated primarily by
approximately 4,500 independent agencies. We are among the seven largest providers of










personal
property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information provided by A.M. Best for 2009.

Competition

The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the
market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2009 (the most recent date such competitive information is available) according
to A.M. Best.

In the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our
distribution system, price, the breadth of our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and
pricing experience enables Allstate to use pricing sophistication to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base.

Pricing
sophistication and related underwriting and marketing programs use a number of risk evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to
vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance
scoring based on credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history;
age and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring based on credit report information.

Our
primary focus in using pricing sophistication methods has been on acquiring and retaining new business. The aim has been to enhance Allstate's competitive position with respect to
"target" market segments while maintaining or improving profitability. "Target customers" generally refers to consumers who want to purchase multiple products from one insurance provider including
auto, homeowners and financial products, who have better retention and potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us. We provide and
continue to enhance a range of discounts to attract more target customers. For example, we implemented an auto discount designed to attract and retain target customers. In many states, we also
increased the discount our homeowners customers receive if they insure their automobiles with Allstate.

Allstate
Your Choice Auto® insurance allows qualified customers to choose from a variety of optional auto insurance packages at various prices. We believe that Allstate Your
Choice Auto differentiates Allstate from its competitors and allows for increased growth and increased retention. Allstate Your Choice Home® allows qualified customers to choose from
options such as a claim-free bonus and greater ability to tailor their own home insurance protection coverage. Allstate Blue® is our non-standard auto insurance
product which offers features such as a loyalty bonus and roadside assistance coverage.

Geographic Markets

The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners, and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States.
Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell
personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada through a distribution system similar to that used in the United States.








The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment for the year ended December 31, 2010,
based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the premiums earned for the segment.

New York10.7%California9.9%Texas9.4%Florida8.3%Pennsylvania5.3%

We continue to take actions to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce variability in our
earnings, while providing quality protection to our customers. Accordingly, we expect to continue to adjust underwriting practices with respect to our property business in markets with significant
catastrophe risk exposure.

Additional Information

Information regarding the last three years' revenues and income from operations attributable to the Allstate Protection segment is
contained in Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 18 also includes information regarding the last three years' identifiable assets attributable to our
property-liability operations, which includes our Allstate Protection segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by
reference.

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Our Allstate Financial segment provides life insurance, retirement and investment products, and voluntary accident and health insurance
products. Our principal products are interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; fixed annuities including deferred and immediate; and voluntary accident and health insurance. Our
institutional products, which we offer on an opportunistic basis, consist primarily of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes issued to
institutional and individual investors. Banking products and services have been offered to customers through the Allstate Bank. The table on page 4 lists our major distribution channels for
this segment, with the associated products and targeted customers.

As
the table indicates, we sell Allstate Financial products to individuals through multiple intermediary distribution channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive
financial specialists, independent agents, and specialized structured settlement brokers. Through March 31, 2010, we also sold products through banks and broker-dealers. Although we continue to
service in force contracts sold through these distribution channels, we no longer solicit new sales through direct relationships with banks or broker-dealers. Certain of our master brokerage
agencies and independent agents may continue to wholesale our products to banks and broker-dealers through their relationships. On February 8, 2011, we announced that we had reached an
agreement to sell substantially all of the deposits of Allstate Bank to Discover Bank and our plans to enter into a multi-year distribution and marketing agreement whereby Discover Bank
will provide banking products and services to Allstate customers in the future. Allstate Financial does not intend to originate banking products or services after the transaction closes, which is
expected to be by mid-year 2011, pending regulatory approval.

We
sell products through independent agents affiliated with approximately 150 master brokerage agencies. Independent workplace enrolling agents and Allstate exclusive agencies also sell
our voluntary accident and health insurance products primarily to employees of unaffiliated businesses. On an opportunistic basis, we sell funding agreements to unaffiliated trusts used to back
medium-term notes.

Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists also sell the following non-proprietary products in addition to
Allstate Financial products: mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance.

Competition

We compete on a wide variety of factors, including the scope of our distribution systems, the type of our product offerings, the
recognition of our brands, our financial strength and ratings, our differentiated product features and prices, and the level of customer service that we provide. With regard to funding agreements, we
compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings.

The
market for life insurance, retirement, and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2010, there were approximately 470 groups
of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2009, the Allstate Financial segment is
the nation's 16thlargest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2009 ordinary life insurance in force and 21stlargest on the basis of
2009 statutory admitted assets. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms, investment
advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure continues to grow










due
to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses, as well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry.

Geographic Markets

We sell life insurance, retirement and investment products, and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States.
Through subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. We also sell funding
agreements in the United States.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended
December 31, 2010, based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the statutory premiums
and annuity considerations.

over the last three years.

Our
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in
run-off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims arises in this segment. Note 18 of the Consolidated Financial Statements contains information
for the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection
segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 18 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE

The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate
Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

Reconciliation of Claims Reserves

The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense
reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements










of
Financial Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(1)Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $2.07 billion, $2.14 billion and $2.27 billion as of
December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

The year-end 2010 gross reserves of $19.47 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined
under GAAP, were $3.33 billion more than the net reserve balance of $16.14 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory
authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $2.07 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP
reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $0.96 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.

As
the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2009 decreased in 2010 by $159 million, compared to
reestimates of the gross reserves of a decrease of $105 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance
cessions.








Loss Reserve Reestimates

The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original
recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section
compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also
presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable. The Loss Reserve Reestimates
table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve
reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

As shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general,
reflect additions to reserves in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced
by Allstate Protection, as discussed more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years
attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008 non-injury reserves to older years
which occurred in 2009 as discussed below.

The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the
ten-year period ended December 31, 2010. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which
the reestimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve
reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses. Since December 31, 2003, the changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation
filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

In 2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that
were less than anticipated in previous estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to the litigation settlements of
$100 million, a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008
non-injury reserves to older years.

In
2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates.

In
2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages
segment.








In
2006, 2005 and 2004, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what
was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in 2006, also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more
than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In
2003, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines, partially offset by favorable Allstate Protection
auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates.

In
2002, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to claim severity and late reported losses for Allstate Protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous
reserve estimates and to increased estimates
of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In
2001, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to greater volume of late reported weather related losses than expected from the end of the year 2000 which were reported in
the year 2001, additional incurred losses on the 1994 Northridge earthquake, adverse results of class action and other litigation, upward reestimates of property losses and upward reestimates of
losses in the Encompass and Canadian businesses.

and Claims Expense Reserves."

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state regulatory
agency. In general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products issued by our subsidiaries, not the holders of securities issued by The Allstate
Corporation. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, price
setting, trade practices, policy forms, statutory accounting methods, corporate governance, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds,
reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, and underwriting standards. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of
statutory financial information, see Note 15 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 13 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Notes 13 and 15 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Agent and Broker Compensation.In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents
and
brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. New disclosure requirements
have been imposed in certain circumstances upon some agents and brokers in several states.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources










of
cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its
ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions
that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation.

Price Regulation.Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use. While they vary from state to
state, the objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.

The
speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i) prior
approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before
the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the
regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen
states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing.

An
insurer's ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to increasing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or
proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can
manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a price that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

Changes
in Allstate's claim settlement process may require Allstate to actuarially adjust loss information used in its pricing process. Some state insurance regulatory authorities may
not approve price increases that give full effect to these adjustments.

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set prices at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance comes under similar pressure, particularly as regulators in states subject to high levels of
catastrophe losses struggle to identify an acceptable methodology to price for catastrophe exposure. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on
credit report information for underwriting and pricing has been the subject of challenges and investigations by










regulators,
legislators, and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the
impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing.

Involuntary Markets.As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.

Guaranty Funds.Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.

National Flood Insurance Program.We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").
The NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the selling and administering of the Standard Flood Insurance
Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States Treasury. We receive expense
allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management, commissions and adjuster fees.

Investment Regulation.Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of
measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example,
states limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the
state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval
requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").

Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators.

Banking.

Privacy Regulation.Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to










collection
and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate
disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of
customer information.

Asbestos.Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but unified support among various
defendant and
insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.
