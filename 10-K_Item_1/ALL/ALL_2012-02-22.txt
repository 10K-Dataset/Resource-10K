Item 1.  Business

The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and their affiliates (collectively,
including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the personal property and casualty insurance business and the life insurance, retirement and investment products
business. It conducts its business primarily in the United States.

The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate is reinventing protection and retirement to help individuals in approximately 16 million households protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Customers can access
Allstate products and services such as auto insurance and homeowners insurance through nearly 12,000 exclusive Allstate agencies and financial representatives in the United States and Canada. Allstate
is the 2ndlargest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2010 statutory direct premiums earned. In addition, according to A.M. Best,
it is the nation's 16thlargest issuer of life insurance business on the basis of 2010 ordinary life insurance in force and 21stlargest on the basis of 2010
statutory admitted assets.

Allstate
has four business segments:

•Allstate
Protection•Discontinued Lines and
Coverages•Allstate
Financial•Corporate and
Other



To achieve its goals in 2012, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:

•maintain auto profitability;•raise returns in homeowners and annuity businesses;•grow insurance premiums; and•proactively manage investments and capital.

In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory
financial information to assess our competitive position.

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 92% of Allstate's 2011 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this
segment, we principally sell private passenger auto and homeowners insurance through agencies and directly through call centers and the internet. These products are marketed under the
Allstate®, Encompass® and Esurance® brand names. The Allstate Protection segment also includes a separate organization called Emerging Businesses which comprises
Business Insurance (commercial products for small business owners), Consumer Household (specialty products including motorcycle, boat, renters and condominium insurance policies), Allstate Dealer
Services (insurance and non-insurance products sold primarily to auto dealers), Allstate Roadside Services (retail and wholesale roadside assistance products) and Ivantage (insurance
agency). We also participate in the involuntary or shared private passenger auto insurance business in order to maintain our licenses to do business in many states. In some states, Allstate exclusive
agencies offer non-proprietary property insurance products.

Allstate
serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral
versus brand-sensitive). Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve customers who prefer local personal advice and service
and are brand-sensitive. In most states, customers can also purchase certain Allstate brand personal insurance products, and obtain service, directly through call centers and the internet. Beginning
in 2012, Allstate Brand direct sales and service will focus on serving customers who prefer personal advice and assistance and work closer with Allstate exclusive agencies. Encompass brand auto and
homeowners insurance products are sold through independent agencies and serve customers who prefer personal service and support primarily from an independent agent and are brand-neutral. Esurance
brand auto insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through call centers and through select agents, including Answer Financial, and serve the self-directed,
brand-sensitive









customers.
Answer Financial, an independent personal lines insurance agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a choice between insurance carriers and offers
comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately twenty insurance companies through its website and over the phone.

Allstate
is transitioning to a new compensation structure for its Allstate exclusive agencies over the next two years. The plan will better align compensation with customer needs and
reward higher performance. The cost neutral change will include a shift to a higher proportion of variable compensation and bonus. In 2012, base commission remains unchanged and the annual bonus will
be based on portfolio growth and household bundling.

Total
Allstate Protection premiums written were $25.98 billion in 2011. Our broad-based network of approximately 10,000 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,700
locations in the U.S. produced approximately 86% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premiums in 2011. 10% of Allstate Protection's written premiums in 2011 were generated by approximately
4,400 independent agencies. To support customer service, we are supporting Allstate exclusive agencies by providing products, tools, education, and resources to help them acquire more business and
retain more customers. Our programs provide financing to agents to acquire books of business and award additional resources to better performing agencies, leading to fewer agencies of larger size.
Approximately 300 of the decrease in the number of Allstate exclusive agencies from 11,500 in 2010 is due to consolidation of a small number of locations that, for specified reasons, were allowed to
operate with two agent numbers. We are among the nine largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory
written premium information provided by A.M. Best for 2010. The remainder of Allstate Protection's written premiums in 2011 were primarily generated directly through call centers and the
internet.

Additionally,
Allstate distribution, through brokering arrangements, offers non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not available. As of
December 31, 2011, Allstate distribution has approximately $1.0 billion of non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related to property
business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $130 million of non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. Answer Financial had $400 million of
non-proprietary premiums written in 2011.

Competition

The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the
market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2010 (the most recent date such competitive information is available) according
to A.M. Best.

In the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our
distribution system, price, the breadth of our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and
pricing experience enables Allstate to use pricing sophistication to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base.

Pricing
sophistication and related underwriting and marketing programs use a number of risk evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to
vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance
scoring based on credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history;
age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring based on credit report information.

Our
primary focus in using pricing sophistication methods has been on acquiring and retaining profitable business. The aim has been to enhance Allstate's competitive position with
respect to "target" market segments while









maintaining
or improving profitability. "Target customers" generally refers to consumers who want to purchase multiple products from one insurance provider including auto, homeowners and financial
products, who have better retention and potentially present more favorable prospects for profitability over the course of their relationships with us. We provide and continue to enhance a range of
discounts to attract more target customers. For example, we discount auto insurance to attract and retain target customers. In many states, we discount homeowners insurance for customers who insure
their automobiles with Allstate.

Allstate
Your Choice Auto® insurance allows qualified customers to choose from a variety of optional auto insurance packages at various prices. We believe that Allstate Your
Choice Auto differentiates Allstate from its competitors and allows for increased growth and increased retention. Allstate Your Choice Home® allows qualified customers to choose from
options such as a claim-free bonus and greater ability to tailor their own home insurance protection coverage. Allstate Blue® is our non-standard auto insurance
product which offers features such as a loyalty bonus and roadside assistance coverage. We have also introduced a claim satisfaction guarantee that promises a return of premium to any Allstate Brand
standard auto insurance customer dissatisfied with their claims experience, which differentiates Allstate from the competition.

Geographic Markets

The principal geographic markets for our auto, homeowners, and other personal property and casualty products are in the United States.
Through various subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of personal property and casualty insurance products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. We also sell
personal property and casualty insurance products in Canada through a distribution system similar to that used in the United States.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of premiums earned for the Allstate Protection segment for the year ended December 31, 2011,
based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the premiums earned for the segment.

New York10.6%California10.0%Texas9.3%Florida8.4%Pennsylvania5.4%

We continue to take actions to support earning an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business and to reduce variability in our
earnings. Accordingly, we expect to continue to adjust underwriting practices with respect to our property business in markets with significant catastrophe risk exposure. Our comprehensive strategic
review of our homeowners insurance business is ongoing.

by reference.

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Our Allstate Financial segment provides life insurance, retirement and investment products, and voluntary accident and health insurance
products. Our principal products are interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; fixed annuities including deferred and immediate; and voluntary accident and health insurance. Our
institutional products, which we most recently offered in 2008, consist of funding agreements sold to unaffiliated trusts that use them to back medium-term notes issued to institutional
and individual investors. Banking products and services were offered to customers through the Allstate Bank through September 2011. The table on page 4 lists our major distribution channels for
this segment, with the associated products and targeted customers.









As
the table indicates, we sell Allstate Financial products to individuals through multiple intermediary distribution channels, including Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive
financial specialists, independent agents, specialized structured settlement brokers and directly through call centers and the internet. We sell products through independent agents affiliated with
approximately 125 master brokerage agencies. Independent workplace enrolling agents and Allstate exclusive agencies also sell our voluntary accident and health insurance products primarily to
employees of unaffiliated businesses.

Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists also sell the following non-proprietary products in addition to
Allstate Financial products: mutual funds, fixed and variable annuities, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance. As of December 31, 2011, Allstate agencies have
approximately $7.5 billion of non-proprietary mutual funds and fixed and variable annuity account balances under management.

In
2011, after receiving regulatory approval to voluntarily dissolve, Allstate Bank ceased operations. In the first half of 2012, we expect to cancel the bank's charter and deregister
The Allstate Corporation as a savings and loan holding company.









Competition

We compete on a wide variety of factors, including the scope of our distribution systems, the type of our product offerings, the
recognition of our brands, our financial strength and ratings, our differentiated product features and prices, and the level of customer service that we provide. With regard to funding agreements, we
compete principally on the basis of our financial strength and ratings.

The
market for life insurance, retirement and investment products continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2011, there were approximately 450 groups
of life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2010, the Allstate Financial segment is
the nation's 16thlargest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2010 ordinary life insurance in force and 21stlargest on the basis of
2010 statutory admitted assets. In addition, because many of these products include a savings or investment component, our competition includes domestic and foreign securities firms, investment
advisors, mutual funds, banks and other financial institutions. Competitive pressure continues to grow due to several factors, including cross marketing alliances between unaffiliated businesses, as
well as consolidation activity in the financial services industry.

Geographic Markets

We sell life insurance, retirement and investment products, and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States.
Through subsidiaries, we are authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam. We also sell funding
agreements in the United States.

The
following table reflects, in percentages, the principal geographic distribution of statutory premiums and annuity considerations for the Allstate Financial segment for the year ended
December 31, 2011, based on information contained in statements filed with state insurance departments. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than 5 percent of the statutory premiums
and annuity considerations.

Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in
run-off. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is presented in this segment. Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements contains
information for the last three years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection
segment and our Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment. Note 19 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE

The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate
Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.









Reconciliation of Claims Reserves

The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense
reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are
reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(1)Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $2.59 billion, $2.07 billion and $2.14 billion as of
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The year-end 2011 gross reserves of $20.38 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined
under GAAP, were $3.83 billion more than the net reserve balance of $16.55 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory
authorities. The principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $2.59 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP
reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $1.00 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.









As
the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2010 decreased in 2011 by $335 million, compared to
reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $174 million. Net reserve reestimates in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance
cessions.

Loss Reserve Reestimates

The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect
to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's
expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and
indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation
period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable.

The
Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the
current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

As shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general,
reflect additions to reserves in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced
by Allstate Protection, as discussed more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years
attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to
older years along with reserve strengthening as discussed below.

The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the
ten-year period ended December 31, 2011. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which
the reestimates are applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve
reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses. Since December 31, 2003, the changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation
filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

In 2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates and catastrophe losses. The increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to the litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of
injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a reallocation of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008
non-injury reserves to older years.

In
2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates.

In
2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate









Protection
more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In
2006, 2005 and 2004, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what
was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in 2006, also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more
than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

In
2003, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to increases primarily related to asbestos and other discontinued lines, partially offset by favorable Allstate Protection
auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was better than previous estimates.

In
2002, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were due to claim severity and late reported losses for Allstate Protection that were greater than what was anticipated in previous
reserve estimates and to increased estimates of losses primarily related to asbestos and environmental liabilities in the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. In
general, such regulation is intended for the protection of those who purchase or use insurance products. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters,
including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, policy forms, price setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims
practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and
corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 16 of the consolidated financial statements. For a
discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 14 of the consolidated financial statements. Notes 14 and 16 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Agent and Broker Compensation.In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents
and
brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. New disclosure requirements
have been imposed in certain circumstances upon agents and brokers in New York.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt.
Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see
Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other









jurisdictions
that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.

Insurance Holding Company Regulation.

Price Regulation.Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file price schedules, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such price schedules, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use. While they vary from state to state, the
objectives of the pricing laws are generally the same: a price cannot be excessive, inadequate, or unfairly discriminatory.

The
speed with which an insurer can change prices in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the pricing laws are (i) prior
approval, (ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a price before
the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws, the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a price, but the price must be filed with the
regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to file prices within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen
states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of pricing laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a price subsequent to its filing.

An
insurer's ability to adjust its prices in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its pricing or
proposed pricing meets the requirements of the pricing laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can
manage its risk of loss by charging a price that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a price that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts
both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set prices at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure, particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss
costs from high levels of catastrophe losses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, our use of insurance scoring based on credit report information for underwriting and pricing has
been the subject of challenges and investigations by regulators, legislators, and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability of the
Allstate Protection segment. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding pricing.

Involuntary Markets.As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.









Guaranty Funds.Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.

National Flood Insurance Program.We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").
The NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the
Standard Flood Insurance Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States
Treasury. We receive expense allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management, commissions and adjuster fees. The federal government is obligated to pay all claims that fall
under the arrangement.

Investment Regulation.Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of
measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example,
states limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the
state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval
requirements may restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").

Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators.

Banking.Allstate Bank ceased operations in 2011, and we expect to cancel its charter and deregister The Allstate
Corporation as a savings and loan holding company in the first half of 2012. The principal supervisory authority for the diversified unitary savings and loan holding company activities of The Allstate
Corporation is the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), and the principal supervisory authority for the Bank is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"). The Allstate Corporation and the Bank,
respectively, are subject to FRB and OCC regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements and enforcement authority. The Bank is also subject to the authority of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.

Privacy Regulation.Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and
confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities
are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.

Asbestos.Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but unified support among various
defendant and
insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.

Environmental.Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The
Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration
of waste sites by Potentially Responsible Parties ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or "ECLs") establish a mechanism to assign liability
to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are
thousands of potential waste sites subject to clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in
dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties' alleged
liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether
Superfund response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages









under
the policies; trigger of coverage; the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions; proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; appropriate
allocation of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and
waste sites not covered under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate's exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may
be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted.
