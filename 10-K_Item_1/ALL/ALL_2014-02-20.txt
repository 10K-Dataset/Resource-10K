Item 1.  Business

The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992 to serve as the holding
company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Life Insurance Company and other subsidiaries
(collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, "Allstate"). Allstate is primarily engaged in the property-liability insurance and life insurance business. It conducts its business primarily in the
United States.

The
Allstate Corporation is the largest publicly held personal lines insurer in the United States. Widely known through the "You're In Good Hands With Allstate®" slogan,
Allstate's strategy is to reinvent protection and retirement to help individuals in approximately 16 million households protect what they have today and better prepare for tomorrow. Customers
can access Allstate products and services such as auto and homeowners insurance through approximately 11,600 exclusive Allstate agencies and financial representatives in the United States and Canada,
as well as through independent agencies, contact centers and the internet. Allstate is the 2ndlargest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2012
statutory direct premiums earned according to A.M. Best. In addition, according to A.M. Best, it is the nation's 17thlargest issuer of life insurance business on the basis
of 2012 ordinary life insurance in force and 24thlargest on the basis of 2012 statutory admitted assets.

Allstate
has four business segments:

•Allstate
Protection•Discontinued Lines and
Coverages•Allstate
Financial•Corporate and
Other



To
achieve its goals in 2014, Allstate is focused on the following priorities:

•grow insurance policies in force;•maintain the underlying combined ratio;•proactively manage investments to generate attractive risk adjusted returns;•modernize the operating model; and•build long-term growth platforms.

In
this annual report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare
statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not subject to the requirement to
prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America ("GAAP"). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory financial information to assess our competitive position.

ALLSTATE PROTECTION SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Total Allstate Protection premiums written were $28.16 billion in 2013. Our Allstate Protection segment accounted for 92% of
Allstate's 2013 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges. In this segment, we principally sell private passenger auto and homeowners insurance through agencies and directly through contact
centers and the internet. These products are marketed under the Allstate®, Encompass®, and Esurance® brand names.

Our Unique StrategyConsumer Segments











Allstate
serves four different consumer segments with distinct interaction preferences (local advice and assistance versus self-directed) and brand preferences (brand-neutral versus
brand-sensitive).

•

Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold primarily through Allstate exclusive agencies and serve
customers who prefer local personal advice and service and are brand-sensitive. Allstate brand sales and service are supported through contact centers and the internet. In 2013, the Allstate brand
represented 91% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. In the U.S., we offer these Allstate brand products through approximately 9,600 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,300
locations. We also offer these products through approximately 1,800 independent agencies that are primarily in rural areas in the U.S. In Canada we offer Allstate brand products through approximately
710 employee producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia).

•

Encompass brand auto, homeowners, and umbrella insurance
products, sold predominantly in the form of a single annual
household ("Package") policy are distributed through independent agencies which serve consumers who prefer personal advice and assistance from an independent adviser and are brand neutral. In 2013,
the Encompass brand represented 4% of the Allstate Protection segment's written premium. Encompass brand products are distributed through approximately 2,500 independent agencies. Encompass is among
the top 15 largest providers of personal property and casualty insurance products through independent agencies in the United States, based on statutory written premium information provided by
A.M. Best for 2012.

•

Esurance brand auto and homeowners insurance products are sold directly to consumers online, through contact centers and
through select agents, including Answer Financial. Esurance serves self-directed, brand-sensitive customers. In 2013, the Esurance brand represented 5% of the Allstate Protection segment's written
premium.

•

Answer Financial, an independent personal lines insurance agency, serves self-directed, brand-neutral consumers who want a
choice between insurance carriers. It offers comparison quotes for auto and homeowners insurance from approximately 25 insurance companies through its website and over the phone and receives fee
income for this service.

The
Allstate Protection segment also produces and sells specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road vehicle insurance policies; other personal lines
products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial lines products for small business owners; roadside assistance products; and
service contracts and other products sold in conjunction with auto lending and vehicle sales transactions. We also participate in the involuntary or shared private passenger auto insurance business in
order to maintain our licenses to do business in many states.

Through
arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers, the Allstate Protection segment may offer non-proprietary products to consumers when an Allstate product is not
available. As of December 31, 2013, Allstate agencies had approximately $1.2 billion of non-proprietary personal insurance premiums under management, primarily related to property
business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $160 million of non-proprietary commercial insurance premiums under management. In addition, Esurance had $44 million of
non-proprietary premiums written in 2013, primarily related to homeowners, renters and motorcycle insurance that Esurance does not offer in all states. Answer Financial had $477 million of
non-proprietary premiums written in 2013.

Competition

The markets for personal private passenger auto and homeowners insurance are highly competitive. The following charts provide the
market shares of our principal competitors in the U.S. by direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2012 according to A.M. Best.

We
monitor our market share compared to our competitors and expect our market share of private passenger auto insurance to increase for the year ended December 31, 2013, but drop
to the third position in the table above.

In
the personal property and casualty insurance market, we compete principally on the basis of the recognition of our brands, the scope of our distribution system, price, the breadth of
our product offerings, product features, customer service, claim handling, and use of technology. In addition, our proprietary database of underwriting and pricing experience enables Allstate to use
sophisticated pricing to more accurately price risks and to cross sell products within our customer base.

Our
primary focus in using sophisticated pricing methods has been on acquiring and retaining profitable business. Our sophisticated pricing and underwriting methods use a number of risk
evaluation factors. For auto insurance, these factors can include but are not limited to vehicle make, model and year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years
insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance scoring based on credit report information. For property insurance, these factors can include but are not
limited to amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history; age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and insurance scoring based on credit
report information.

ALLSTATE FINANCIAL SEGMENT

Products and Distribution

Our Allstate Financial segment provides life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance. Our principal products are
interest-sensitive, traditional and variable life insurance; and voluntary accident and health insurance. We sell Allstate Financial products through Allstate exclusive agencies and approximately
1,280 exclusive financial specialists, and workplace enrolling independent agents. The table below lists our current distribution channels with the associated products and target customers.

Allstate
exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists also sell the following non-proprietary products in addition to Allstate Financial products: mutual funds, fixed and
variable annuities, disability insurance, and long-term care insurance. As of December 31, 2013, Allstate agencies have approximately $9.9 billion of non-proprietary mutual funds and
fixed and variable annuity account balances under management. New and additional deposits into these non-proprietary products were $1.3 billion in 2013.

Competition

We compete on a wide variety of factors, including product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength and ratings, prices,
distribution and the level of customer service. The market for life insurance continues to be highly fragmented and competitive. As of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 420 groups of
life insurance companies in the United States, most of which offered one or more similar products. According to A.M. Best, as of December 31, 2012, the Allstate Financial segment is the
nation's 17thlargest issuer of life insurance and related business on the basis of 2012 ordinary life insurance in force and 24thlargest on the basis of 2012 statutory
admitted assets.

Geographic Markets

We sell life insurance and voluntary accident and health insurance throughout the United States. Through subsidiaries, we are
authorized to sell various types of these products in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam.

ALLSTATE EXCLUSIVE AGENCIES

Allstate exclusive agencies offer for sale products targeted to consumers that prefer local advice and branded products from both the
Allstate Protection and Allstate Financial segments. They offer Allstate brand auto and homeowners insurance policies; specialty auto products including motorcycle, trailer, motor home and off-road
vehicle insurance policies; other personal lines products including renter, condominium, landlord, boat, umbrella and manufactured home insurance policies; commercial products for small business
owners; and roadside assistance products. Allstate exclusive agencies and exclusive financial specialists offer various life insurance products, as well as voluntary accident and health insurance
products. In addition, arrangements made with other companies, agencies, and brokers allow Allstate exclusive agencies the ability to make available non-proprietary products to consumers when an
Allstate product is not available.

In
the U.S., Allstate brand products are sold through approximately 9,600 Allstate exclusive agencies in approximately 9,300 locations. In addition, these agencies employ approximately
20,800 licensed sales professionals who are licensed to sell our products. We also offer these products through approximately 1,800 independent agencies in primarily rural areas in the U.S. In Canada
we offer Allstate brand products through approximately 710 producers working in five provinces across the country (Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia). We grew the number of
exclusive agencies in 2013 following several years of decline primarily resulting from agency consolidations and mergers, consistent with our prior plans. We pursue opportunities for growing Allstate
brand exclusive agency distribution based on market opportunities.

We
support exclusive agencies in a variety of ways to facilitate customer service and Allstate's overall growth strategy. For example, we offer assistance to Allstate exclusive agencies
with sales and business processes and provide education and other resources to help them acquire more business and retain more customers. Our programs to support our exclusive agencies and help them
grow larger include offering financing to agents to acquire other agencies and awarding additional resources to better performing agencies. We support our relationship with Allstate exclusive agencies
through several national and regional working groups:

•The Agency Executive Council, led by Allstate's senior leadership, engages exclusive agencies on our customer service and
growth strategy. Membership includes approximately 20 Allstate exclusive agency owners selected on the basis of performance, thought leadership and credibility among their peer group.•The National Advisory Board brings together Allstate's senior leadership and a cross section of Allstate exclusive agents
and exclusive financial specialists from around the country to address national business issues and develop solutions.•Regional Advisory Boards support Allstate exclusive agency owner
engagement within each of Allstate's 15 regional offices
in the U.S. and within Canada.

Allstate's
strategy is to help improve individual agency success, new business sales, customer satisfaction, retention and productivity. Allstate is striving to help develop stronger,
more valuable exclusive agencies with resources to build stronger customer relationships, provide differentiating levels of service by focusing on more complex customer needs, and support technology
that enables customer self-service for simpler needs.









The
compensation structure for Allstate exclusive agencies rewards agencies for delivering high value to our customers and achieving certain business outcomes such as product
profitability, net growth and a diverse product mix. The Allstate exclusive agent remuneration comprises a base commission, variable compensation and a bonus. Variable compensation has two components:
agency success factors (local presence, Allstate Financial product sales and licensed staff), which must be achieved in order to qualify for the second component, customer experience (customer
satisfaction survey). In addition, a bonus that is a percentage of premiums can be earned by agents. To qualify for the bonus, agents must achieve a loss ratio and an amount of sales of Allstate
Financial products. The bonus is earned by increases in multi-line households and increases in Property-Liability policies in force and Allstate Financial policies in force. Other elements of
exclusive agency compensation and support include start-up agency bonuses, marketing support payments, technology and data allowances, regional promotions and recognition trips based on achievement.
There are no significant changes to the compensation framework planned for 2014.

Since
Allstate brand customers prefer personal advice and assistance, beginning in 2013 all Allstate brand customers who purchase their policies directly through contact centers and the
internet are immediately assigned an Allstate agency relationship at the time of purchase.

OTHER BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Our Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations. Note 20 of the
consolidated financial statements contains information regarding the revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our Corporate and Other segment over the last three
years.

Our
Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment includes results from insurance coverage that we no longer write and results for certain commercial and other businesses in run-off. Our
exposure to asbestos, environmental and other discontinued lines claims is presented in this segment. Note 20 of the consolidated financial statements contains information for the last three
years regarding revenues, income from operations, and identifiable assets attributable to our property-liability operations, which includes both our Allstate Protection segment and our Discontinued
Lines and Coverages segment. Note 20 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

RESERVE FOR PROPERTY-LIABILITY CLAIMS AND CLAIMS EXPENSE

The following information regarding reserves applies to all of our property-liability operations, encompassing both the Allstate
Protection segment and the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

Reconciliation of Claims Reserves

The following tables are summary reconciliations of the beginning and ending property-liability insurance claims and claims expense
reserves, displayed individually for each of the last three years. The first table presents reserves on a gross (before reinsurance) basis. The end of year gross reserve balances are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of









Financial
Position. The second table presents reserves on a net (after reinsurance) basis. The total net property-liability insurance claims and claims expense amounts are reflected in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

(1)In
2013, the gross change in provision attributable to prior years increased $1.07 billion compared to 2012, primarily due to increases
for Michigan and New Jersey unlimited personal injury protection and Discontinued Lines and Coverages reserves. In 2012 and 2011, the Company also increased Michigan unlimited personal injury
protection reserves by $832 million and $394 million, respectively, and Discontinued Lines and coverages reserves (see the Property-Liability Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section
for additional discussion).(2)In
2013, the net change in provision attributable to prior years decreased $544 million compared to 2012, primarily due to lower
catastrophe reserve reestimates.(3)Reserves
for claims and claims expense are net of reinsurance of $4.66 billion, $4.01 billion and $2.59 billion as of
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.(4)The
Esurance opening balance sheet reserves were reestimated in 2012 resulting in a reduction in reserves due to lower severity. The
adjustment was recorded as a reduction in goodwill and an increase in payables to the seller under the terms of the purchase agreement and therefore had no impact on claims expense or the loss ratio.









The year-end 2013 gross reserves of $21.86 billion for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense, as determined under GAAP, were
$5.97 billion more than the net reserve balance of $15.89 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The
principal differences are reinsurance recoverables from third parties totaling $4.66 billion that reduce reserves for statutory reporting but are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a
liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $1.12 billion. Remaining differences are due to variations in requirements between GAAP and statutory reporting.

As
the tables above illustrate, Allstate's net reserve for property-liability insurance claims and claims expense at the end of 2012 decreased in 2013 by $121 million, compared to
reestimates of the gross reserves of an increase of $1.25 billion. Net reserve reestimates in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were more favorable than the gross reserve reestimates due to reinsurance
cessions.

Loss Reserve Reestimates

The following Loss Reserve Reestimates table illustrates the change over time of the net reserves established for property-liability
insurance claims and claims expense at the end of the last eleven calendar years. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading
down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to that reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows retroactive reestimates of the original
recorded reserve as of the end of each successive year which is the result of Allstate's expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section
compares the latest reestimated reserve to the reserve originally established, and indicates whether the original reserve was adequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims. The table also
presents the gross reestimated liability as of the end of the latest reestimation period, with separate disclosure of the related reestimated reinsurance recoverable.

The
Loss Reserve Reestimates table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the
current and prior years. Unfavorable reserve reestimates are shown in this table in parentheses.

As
shown in the above table, the subsequent cumulative increase in the net reserves established up to December 31, 2004, in general, reflect additions to reserves in the
Discontinued Lines and Coverages Segment, primarily for asbestos and environmental liabilities, which offset the effects of favorable severity trends experienced by Allstate Protection, as discussed
more fully below. The cumulative increases in reserves established as of December 31, 2006 and 2007 are due to the shift of reserves to older accident years attributable to a reallocation of
reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, litigation settlements, reclassification of injury and non-injury reserves to older years along with reserve strengthening
as discussed below.

The
following table is derived from the Loss Reserve Reestimates table and summarizes the effect of reserve reestimates, net of reinsurance, on calendar year operations for the ten-year
period ended December 31, 2013. The total of each column details the amount of reserve reestimates made in the indicated calendar year and shows the accident years to which the reestimates are
applicable. The amounts in the total accident year column on the far right represent the cumulative reserve reestimates for the indicated accident year(s). Favorable reserve reestimates are shown in
this table in parentheses. The changes in total have generally been favorable other than 2008 which was adversely impacted due to litigation filed in conjunction with a Louisiana deadline for filing
suits related to Hurricane Katrina, as shown and discussed more fully below.

In
2013, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2003 & prior is due to reserve strengthening by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment and a reclassification of injury reserves to older years.

In
2012, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates. The
increased reserves in accident years 2002 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2011, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous estimates and catastrophe losses. The
increased reserves in accident years 2001 & prior is due to a reclassification of injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2010, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses and auto severity development that was less than anticipated in previous
estimates, partially offset by litigation settlements. The increased reserves in accident years 2000 & prior is due to the litigation settlements of $100 million, a reclassification of
injury reserves to older years and reserve strengthening.

In
2009, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. The shift of
reserves to older accident years is attributable to a









reallocation
of reserves related to employee postretirement benefits to more accident years, and a reclassification of injury and 2008 non-injury reserves to older years.

In
2008, unfavorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection catastrophe losses that were more than anticipated in previous estimates.

In
2007, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto severity development that was less than what was anticipated in previous estimates.
Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to environmental liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages
segment.

In
2006, 2005 and 2004, favorable prior year reserve reestimates were primarily due to Allstate Protection auto injury severity and late reported loss development that was less than what
was anticipated in previous reserve estimates and in 2006, also by catastrophe losses that were less than anticipated in previous estimates. Decreased reserve reestimates for Allstate Protection more
than offset increased reestimates of losses primarily related to asbestos liabilities reported by the Discontinued Lines and Coverages segment.

REGULATION

Allstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent, and substance of such regulation varies
by state but generally has its source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These
rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster
licensing, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of
dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, and corporate governance. Some of these matters are discussed in more detail below. For a discussion of statutory
financial information, see Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements.
Notes 15 and 17 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.

Agent and Broker Compensation.In recent years, several states considered new legislation or regulations regarding the compensation of agents
and
brokers by insurance companies. The proposals ranged in nature from new disclosure requirements to new duties on insurance agents and brokers in dealing with customers. Agents and brokers in New York
are required to disclose certain information concerning compensation.

Limitations on Dividends By Insurance Subsidiaries.As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, The Allstate
Corporation
relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt.
Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. For additional information regarding those restrictions, see
Part II, Item 5 of this report. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends and in
some jurisdictions the laws may be more restrictive.









Insurance Holding Company Regulation.

Rate Regulation.Nearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or
coverage
forms, and other information with the state's regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.

The
speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or in response to increasing costs depends, in part, on whether the rating laws are (i) prior approval,
(ii) file-and-use, or (iii) use-and-file laws. In states having prior approval laws, the regulator must approve a rate before the insurer may use it. In states having file-and-use laws,
the insurer does not have to wait for the regulator's approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used. A use-and-file law requires an insurer to
file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them. Eighteen states, including California and New York, have prior approval laws. Under all three types of rating laws, the
regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing.

An
insurer's ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is often dependent on an insurer's ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or
proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer
can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer's ability to charge a rate that
reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more
selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its profitability.

From
time to time, the private passenger auto insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at
levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs and expenses. Homeowners insurance can come under similar pressure, particularly in states subject to significant increases in loss
costs from high levels of catastrophe losses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. In addition, Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models that are being
reviewed by regulators and special interest groups. The result could be legislation or regulation that adversely affects the profitability or growth of the Allstate Protection segment. We cannot
predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding rating.

Involuntary Markets.As a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are
required
to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable
to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.

Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association.The Michigan Catastrophic Claim Association ("MCCA") is a mandatory insurance coverage and
reinsurance
indemnification mechanism for personal injury protection losses that provides indemnification for losses over a retention level that increases every other MCCA fiscal year. The retention level is









$530 thousand
per claim and $500 thousand per claim for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, respectively. It operates similar to a reinsurance program
and is funded by participating companies through a per vehicle annual assessment. This assessment is included in our premiums that we charge our customers and when collected, we remit the assessment
to the MCCA. The MCCA may not be funded on an actuarial basis and can accumulate unfunded claims liabilities. As required for a member company, we report covered paid and unpaid claims to the MCCA,
when estimates of loss for a reported claim are expected to exceed the retention level. The MCCA reimburses members as claims are paid and billed by members to the MCCA. Because of the nature of the
coverage, losses may be paid over the lifetime of an insured, and accordingly, significant levels of incurred claims reserves are recorded by member companies as well as offsetting reinsurance
recoverables. The MCCA currently has unfunded claims liabilities with an obligation to indemnify its members. The MCCA's future operation and form are dependent upon the continuation of enabling state
legislation. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact from this entity on Allstate.

Guaranty Funds.Under state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in
order to
cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies.

National Flood Insurance Program.We voluntarily participate as a Write Your Own carrier in the National Flood Insurance Program ("NFIP").
The NFIP
is administered and regulated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. We operate in a fiduciary capacity as a fiscal agent of the federal government in the issuing and administering of the
Standard Flood Insurance Policy. This involves the collection of premiums belonging to the federal government and the paying of covered claims by directly drawing on funds of the United States
Treasury. We receive expense allowances from the NFIP for underwriting administration, claims management, commissions and adjuster fees. The federal government is obligated to pay all claims that fall
under the arrangement.

Investment Regulation.Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulations that require investment portfolio diversification and that limit
the
amount of investment in certain categories. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus.
Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.

Exiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies.Most states regulate an insurer's ability to exit a market. For example,
states may
limit, to varying degrees, an insurer's ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state,
except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may
restrict an insurer's ability to exit unprofitable markets.

Variable Life Insurance and Registered Fixed Annuities.The sale and administration of variable life insurance and registered fixed annuities
with
market value adjustment features are subject to extensive regulatory oversight at the federal and state level, including regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA").

Broker-Dealers, Investment Advisors, and Investment Companies.The Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers, registered investment
advisors,
and investment companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the SEC, FINRA and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators.

Privacy Regulation.Federal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of
customer
information and to notify customers about their policies and practices relating to collection and disclosure of customer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and
confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of customer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities
are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of customer information.

Asbestos.Congress has considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past, but unified support among various
defendant and
insurer groups considered essential to any possible reform has been lacking. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.

Environmental.Environmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of both federal and state regulation. The
Comprehensive
Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 ("Superfund") and comparable state statutes ("mini-Superfund") govern the clean-up and restoration of waste sites by Potentially
Responsible Parties ("PRPs"). Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (Environmental Clean-up Laws or "ECLs") establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs
fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP is dependent on a variety of factors. By some estimates, there are thousands of potential waste









sites
subject to clean-up, but the exact number is unknown. The extent of clean-up necessary and the process of assigning liability remain in dispute. The insurance industry is involved in extensive
litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties' alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance
industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether Superfund response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages under the
policies; trigger of coverage; the applicability of several types of pollution exclusions; proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; appropriate allocation
of liability among triggered insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an "occurrence." Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered
under Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues. Allstate's exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is
uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted.
