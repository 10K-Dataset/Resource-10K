Item 1.    Business

General

Corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851. The
present corporation was incorporated in the State of New York in December 1936. The Company’s name was changed from Corning Glass Works to Corning Incorporated on April 28, 1989.

Corning is a global, technology-based corporation that operates in five reportable segments: Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life Sciences.
Corning manufactures and processes products at approximately 80 plants in 13 countries.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning’s Display Technologies segment manufactures glass substrates for active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs), that are used primarily in
notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, and LCD televisions. Corning’s facilities in Kentucky, Japan, Taiwan, and China and those of Samsung Corning Precision Materials Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision) in Korea develop,
manufacture and supply high quality glass substrates using a proprietary fusion manufacturing process and technology expertise. Corning owns 50% of Samsung Corning Precision, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. owns 43% and three other shareholders own
the remaining 7%. Samsung Corning Precision sells LCD glass to panel manufacturers in Korea, while panel manufacturers located in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and China and other leading LCD-producing areas of the world are supplied by Corning. Samsung
Corning Precision’s financial statements are attached in Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.

Corning is a
technology leader in this market introducing large-sized glass substrates used by our customers in the production of larger LCDs for monitors and television. We are recognized for providing product innovations that help our customers produce larger,
lighter, thinner and higher-resolution displays more affordably. In industry language, glass sizes advance in what are called generations. Glass substrates are currently available from Corning in sizes up to Generation 10 (2,850mm x 3,050mm).
Generation 10 glass substrates are produced at an advanced manufacturing facility located at Sharp Corporation’s industrial complex in Sakai City, Japan, which eliminates the need for traditional packaging, shipping, and delivery methods. Large
substrates (Generation 5 and higher) allow LCD manufacturers to produce larger and a greater number of panels from each substrate. The larger size leads to economies of scale for LCD manufacturers.

Corning invented its proprietary fusion manufacturing process, which is the cornerstone of the Company’s technology leadership
in the LCD industry. The automated process yields high quality glass substrates with excellent dimensional stability and uniformity - essential attributes for the production of increasingly larger, high performance active matrix LCDs. Corning’s
fusion process is scalable and is thought to be the most effective process in producing large size substrates. In 2006, Corning launched EAGLE XG®, the industry’s first environmentally-friendly LCD glass substrate that is free of heavy metals. In 2010, leveraging the EAGLE XG®composition, Corning introduced EAGLE XG®Slim glass, a new line of slim glass substrates which enables lighter-weight portable devices and thinner televisions and monitors. In 2011, Corning launched Corning
Lotus™Glass, an environmentally friendly, high-performance display glass developed to enable cutting-edge
technologies, including organic light-emitting diode (OLED) displays and next generation liquid crystal displays (LCD). Corning Lotus Glass helps support the demanding manufacturing processes of both OLED and liquid crystal displays for high
performance, portable devices such as smart phones, tablets, and notebook computers.

LCD glass manufacturing is a highly capital intensive
business. Corning has made significant investments to expand its LCD glass facilities in response to customer demand. The environment is very competitive. Important attributes for success include efficient manufacturing, access to capital,
technology know-how, and patents.

Raw Materials

Corning’s
production of specialty glasses, ceramics, and related materials requires significant quantities of energy, uninterrupted power sources, certain precious metals, and various batch materials.

Although energy shortages have not been a problem recently, the cost of energy remains volatile. Corning has achieved flexibility through engineering changes to take advantage of low-cost energy sources
in most significant processes. Specifically, many of Corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with natural gas, propane, oil or electricity, or a combination of these energy sources.

Availability of resources (ores, minerals, polymers, and processed chemicals) required in manufacturing operations, appears to be adequate.
Corning’s suppliers, from time to time, may experience capacity limitations in their own operations, or may eliminate certain product lines. Corning believes it has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch materials and precious
metals. For many products, Corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials shortages.

Certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently sole-sourced or available only from a limited number of suppliers. Any future difficulty in obtaining
sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments, or reductions in Corning’s gross margins.

Patents and Trademarks

Inventions by members of Corning’s research and
engineering staff have been, and continue to be, important to the Company’s growth. Patents have been granted on many of these inventions in the United States and other countries. Some of these patents have been licensed to other manufacturers,
