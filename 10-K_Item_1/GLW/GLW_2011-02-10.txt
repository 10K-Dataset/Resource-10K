Item 1.    Business

General

Corning traces its origins to a glass business established in 1851. The
present corporation was incorporated in the State of New York in December 1936. The Company’s name was changed from Corning Glass Works to Corning Incorporated on April 28, 1989.

Corning is a global, technology-based corporation that operates in five reportable business segments: Display Technologies, Telecommunications, Environmental Technologies, Specialty Materials and Life
Sciences. Corning manufactures and processes products at approximately 60 plants in 14 countries.

Display Technologies Segment

Corning’s Display Technologies segment manufactures glass substrates for active matrix liquid crystal displays (LCDs), that are used
primarily in notebook computers, flat panel desktop monitors, and LCD televisions. Corning’s facilities in Kentucky, Japan, Taiwan, and China and those of Samsung Corning Precision Materials Co., Ltd. (Samsung Corning Precision) in Korea
develop, manufacture and supply high quality glass substrates using a proprietary fusion manufacturing process and technology expertise. Corning owns 50% of Samsung Corning Precision, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. owns 43% and three other
shareholders own the remaining 7%. Samsung Corning Precision sells LCD glass to panel manufacturers in Korea, while panel manufacturers located in Japan, Taiwan, Singapore and China and other leading LCD-producing areas of the world are supplied by
Corning. Samsung Corning Precision’s financial statements are attached in Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.

Corning is a technology leader in this market introducing new large-sized glass substrates used by our customers in the production of larger LCDs for
monitors and television. We are recognized for providing product innovations that help our customers produce larger, lighter, thinner and higher-resolution displays more affordably. In industry language, glass sizes advance in what are called
generations. Glass substrates are currently available from Corning in sizes up to Generation 10 (2,850mm x 3,050mm). Generation 10 glass substrates are produced at our newest manufacturing facility, which opened in October 2009. This advanced
facility, located at Sharp Corporation’s industrial complex in Sakai City, Japan, eliminates the need for traditional packaging, shipping, and delivery methods. Large substrates (Generation 5 and higher) allow LCD manufacturers to produce
larger and a greater number of panels from each substrate. The larger size leads to economies of scale for LCD manufacturers.

Corning invented its proprietary fusion manufacturing process, which is the cornerstone of the Company’s technology leadership in the LCD industry. The automated process yields high quality glass
substrates with excellent dimensional stability and uniformity - essential attributes for the production of increasingly larger, high performance active matrix LCDs. Corning’s fusion process is scalable and is thought to be the most effective
process in producing large size substrates. In 2006, Corning launched EAGLE XG®, the industry’s first
environmentally-friendly LCD glass substrate that is free of heavy metals. In 2010, leveraging the EAGLE XG®composition, Corning introduced EAGLE XG®Slim glass, a new line of slim glass substrates which enables
lighter-weight portable devices and thinner televisions and monitors.

LCD glass manufacturing is a highly capital intensive business. Corning
has made significant investments to expand its LCD glass facilities in response to customer demand. The environment is very competitive. Important attributes for success include efficient manufacturing, access to capital, technology know-how, and
patents.

supply chain efficiency, a wide product line and superior product attributes. For laboratory products, Greiner, Becton Dickinson, Kimble-Chase, and Duran are the principal worldwide competitors. Corning also faces increasing competition from two
large distributors that have pursued backward integration or introduced private label products.

Raw Materials

Corning’s production of specialty glasses, ceramics, and related materials requires significant quantities of energy, uninterrupted power sources,
certain precious metals, and various batch materials.

Although energy shortages have not been a problem recently, the cost of energy remains
volatile. Corning has achieved flexibility through important engineering changes to take advantage of low-cost energy sources in most significant processes. Specifically, many of Corning’s principal manufacturing processes can be operated with
natural gas, propane, oil or electricity, or a combination of these energy sources.

Availability of resources (ores, minerals, polymers, and
processed chemicals) required in manufacturing operations, appears to be adequate. Corning’s suppliers, from time to time, may experience capacity limitations in their own operations, or may eliminate certain product lines. Corning believes it
has adequate programs to ensure a reliable supply of batch materials and precious metals. For many products, Corning has alternate glass compositions that would allow operations to continue without interruption in the event of specific materials
shortages.

Certain key materials and proprietary equipment used in the manufacturing of products are currently sole-sourced or available only
from a limited number of suppliers. Any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in lost sales due to delays or reductions in product shipments, or reductions in Corning’s gross margins.
