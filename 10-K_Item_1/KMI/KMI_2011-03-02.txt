▪On May 14, 2010, KMP and Copano Energy, L.L.C. entered into formal agreements for a joint venture to provide natural gas gathering, transportation and processing services to natural gas producers in the Eagle Ford shale gas formation in south Texas.  Eagle Ford Gathering LLC is owned 50% by KMP and 50% by Copano.  Copano also serves as operator and managing member of Eagle Ford Gathering LLC. KMP and Copano have committed approximately 375 million cubic feet per day of natural gas capacity to the joint venture through 2024 for transportation on KMP’s natural gas pipeline that extends from Laredo to Katy, Texas, and for processing at Copano’s natural gas processing plant located in Colorado County, Texas.



On July 6, 2010, Eagle Ford Gathering LLC announced the execution of a definitive long-term, fee-based gas services agreement with SM Energy Company.  According to the provisions of the agreement, SM Energy will commit Eagle Ford production from its assets located in LaSalle, Dimmitt, and Webb Counties, Texas up to a maximum level of 200 million cubic feet per day over a ten year term.  Eagle Ford Gathering LLC committed to construct approximately 85 miles of 24-inch and 30-inch diameter pipeline to serve SM Energy’s acreage in the western Eagle Ford shale formation, and to connect it to KMP’s Freer compressor station located in Duval County, Texas.



On November 15, 2010, Eagle Ford Gathering LLC announced the execution of a similar fourteen year gas services agreement with Chesapeake Energy Marketing, Inc. for the remainder of the initial project capacity.  Eagle Ford will construct approximately 25 miles of additional 24-inch and 30-inch diameter pipeline to access the Chesapeake acreage and combined, KMP and Copano will invest approximately $175 million for the expanded project.  As of December 31, 2010, KMP’s capital contributions (and net equity investment) in Eagle Ford Gathering LLC totaled $29.9 million.



On January 6, 2011, KMP and Copano announced plans to invest an additional aggregate $100 million to further expand the Eagle Ford joint venture by providing incremental gathering and processing capacity of more than 200 million cubic feet per day of natural gas to producers through construction of additional pipeline facilities and a long-term agreement with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company for additional processing and fractionation services.  Related to this expansion, Eagle Ford Gathering will construct both a 54 mile, 24-inch diameter crossover pipeline between KMP’s existing pipelines, and an additional 20 mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline that will enable Eagle Ford to deliver gas to Formosa.  KMP will construct and operate the two additional pipelines for Eagle Ford.  In addition, Eagle Ford executed an agreement with Formosa under which Formosa will provide the joint ve
nture gas processing and fractionation services at its Point Comfort, Texas facilities. On February 3, 2011, KMP and Copano announced the execution of a gas services agreement with Anadarko E&P Company L.P. for a significant portion of the expanded capacity resulting from the crossover project. KMP expects the crossover facilities to be completed by the end of 2011;



▪On May 21, 2010, KMP purchased a 50% ownership interest in Petrohawk Energy Corporation’s natural gas gathering and treating business in the Haynesville shale gas formation located in northwest Louisiana.  KMP paid an aggregate consideration of $917.4 million in cash for its 50% equity ownership interest.  Petrohawk continued to operate the business during a short transition period, and beginning October 1, 2010, a newly formed company named KinderHawk Field Services LLC, owned 50% by KMP and 50% by Petrohawk, assumed the joint venture operations. Through year-end 2011, we have agreed not to take incentive distributions on the approximately 7.9 million units KMP issued to finance this transaction.  Further information on KinderHawk Field Services LLC is discussed below in “—(c) Narrative Description of Business—Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP—Texas

▪On August 13, 2010, KMP’s subsidiary Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC, referred to in this report as KMIGT, completed construction and placed into service all remaining capital improvements that increased the storage and withdrawal capability of its Huntsman natural gas storage facility, located near Sidney, Nebraska.  Project construction commenced in October 2009, and total costs for the project were approximately $10.1 million, significantly under the original budget.  Incremental storage capacity arising from the expansion project is contracted under a firm service agreement for a five-year term, and incremental service on these new facilities began on February 1, 2010;



▪On September 1, 2010, KMP acquired the natural gas treating assets of Gas-Chill, Inc. for an aggregate consideration of $13.1 million, consisting of $10.5 million in cash paid on closing, and an obligation to pay a holdback amount of $2.6 million within eighteen months from closing.  The acquired assets primarily consist of more than 100 mechanical refrigeration units that are used to remove hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas streams prior to entering transmission pipelines. The refrigeration units are designed to extract natural gas liquids from the inlet gas stream.  The acquisition complemented and expanded KMP’s existing natural gas treating operations;



▪In September 2010, KMP completed construction on an approximately $100 million expansion project that significantly increases the working capacity of its North Dayton natural gas storage facility located in Liberty County, Texas.   The project involved the development and mining of a third underground storage cavern that added approximately 7.0 billion cubic feet of working natural gas storage capacity at the facility.  The new cavern is anticipated to be fully operational in the second quarter of 2011;



▪On October 5, 2010, KMP’s 50%-owned Rockies Express Pipeline LLC completed construction on its Arlington natural gas compression station located in Carbon County, Wyoming.  Combined with its Big Hole compression station located in Moffat County, Colorado that was completed in December 2009, the compression expansion project allows for the transportation of an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of natural gas on the Rockies Express system that runs from the Meeker Hub, located in Rio Blanco County, Colorado, eastward to the Cheyenne Hub, located in Weld County, Colorado (on the Rockies Express-Entrega pipeline segment).  Total costs for these two compression facilities were approximately $50.5 million, significantly under the original budget;



▪On October 12, 2010, Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC began interim pipeline transportation service on its Fayetteville Express natural gas pipeline system, a 187-mile, 42-inch diameter pipeline that provides shippers in the Arkansas Fayetteville shale gas area with takeaway natural gas capacity and further access to growing markets.  The pipeline system began firm contract transportation service to customers on January 1, 2011, and construction was fully completed in January 2011.  KMP owns a 50% interest in Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, and Energy Transfer Partners L.P. owns the remaining interest and also operates the Fayetteville Express pipeline system. KMP’s current estimate of total construction costs on the project is slightly less than $1.0 billion (versus the original budget of $1.3 billion).  Further information on the Fayetteville Express pipeline system 
is discussed below in “—(c) Narrative Description of Business—Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP—Central Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Group—Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC;”



▪OnNovember 18, 2010, KMIGT was notified by the FERC of a proceeding against it pursuant to Section 5 of the Natural Gas Act. The proceeding will set the matter for hearing and determine whether KMIGT’s current transportation rates, which were approved by the FERC in KMIGT’s last transportation rate case settlement, remain just and reasonable. For further information on this proceeding, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report; and

▪As of the date of this report, KMIGT continues construction on the expansion of its mainline natural gas pipeline facilities that run from Franklin to Hastings, Nebraska.  The pipeline expansion and capital improvements will create up to ten million cubic feet per day of natural gas capacity to serve an ethanol plant located near Aurora, Nebraska.  Project construction commenced in October 2009 and is expected to be completed in spring 2011.  The current estimate of total construction costs on the project is approximately $18.6 million.



CO2—KMP



▪In December 2010, KMP completed construction on the previously announced Eastern Shelf Pipeline project in the eastern Permian Basin area of Texas.  The project discussed further below, involved the installation of a 91-mile 10-inch carbon dioxide distribution pipeline, and the development of a new carbon dioxide flood in the Katz oil field located near Knox City, Texas. Announced in July 2009, the project further expands KMP’s carbon dioxide operations, and the current estimate of total construction costs on the project is approximately $230 million.

The new carbon dioxide pipeline begins near Snyder, Texas and ends west of Knox City.  It provides customers with access to a steady supply of carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery, and it has an initial capacity of 65 million cubic feet per day, with the ability to increase the capacity to 200 million cubic feet per day.  KMP began injecting carbon dioxide into the line in November 2010, and carbon dioxideinjections into the Katz field commenced in December 2010.  The development of a new carbon dioxide flood in the Katz field is projected to produce an incremental 25 million barrels of oil over the next 15 to 20 years and will provide a platform for future enhanced oil recovery operations in the region; and



▪During 2010, KMP entered into new sales and delivery contracts of over 1.3 trillion cubic feet of carbon dioxide to ten customers for an average term of eight years.  These agreements include both contracts with new customers and the replacement or extension of existing agreements (which were set to expire over the next few years) at generally more favorable terms.  Nearly one trillion cubic feet of the carbon dioxide contracted for is with third-party customers, with the remaining amount for use at the SACROC and Katz oil fields.



Terminals—KMP



▪On January 15, 2010, KMP acquired three ethanol handling train terminals from US Development Group LLC for an aggregate consideration of $201.1 million, consisting of $114.3 million in cash, $81.7 million in common units, and$5.1 million in assumed liabilities.  The three train terminals are located in Linden, New Jersey; Baltimore, Maryland; and Euless, Texas.  As part of the transaction, KMP announced the formation of a joint venture with US Development Group LLC to optimize and coordinate customer access to the three acquired terminals, other ethanol terminal assets KMP already owns and operates, and other terminal projects currently under development by both parties;



▪On March 5, 2010, KMP acquired a diverse mix of bulk and liquids terminal assets from Slay Industries for an aggregate consideration of $101.6 million, consisting of $97.0 million in cash, assumed liabilities of $1.6 million, and an obligation to pay additional cash consideration of $3.0 million in years 2013 through 2019, contingent upon the purchased assets providing KMP an agreed-upon amount of earnings during the three years following the acquisition.  Including accrued interest, KMP expects to pay approximately $2.0 million of this contingent consideration in the first half of 2013.



The acquired assets include (i) a marine terminal located in Sauget, Illinois; (ii) a transload liquid operation located in Muscatine, Iowa; (iii) a liquid bulk terminal located in St. Louis, Missouri and (iv) a warehousing distribution center located in St. Louis.  All of the acquired terminals have long-term contracts with large creditworthy shippers.  As part of the transaction, KMP and Slay Industries entered into joint venture agreements at both the Kellogg Dock coal bulk terminal, located in Modoc, Illinois, and at the newly created North Cahokia terminal, located in Sauget and which has approximately 175 acres of land ready for development.

KMP signed a contract with a major central Appalachian coal producer that involves and entails an expansion of KMP’s International Marine Terminals facility, a multi-product, import-export facility located in Port Sulphur, Louisiana and owned 66 2/3% by KMP.  The approximately $70 million project will enable IMT to handle an incremental six million tons of coal with a minimum commitment of four million tons, and KMP expects this project to be completed in 2012.  The letter of intent is with a major western coal producer and entails an expansion of one of KMP’s Houston, Texas petroleum coke facilities to handle up to 2.2 million tons of coal at 
the facility.  KMP expects this project to cost approximately $15 million and should be completed in the third quarter of 2011, pending the obtaining of permits.



Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP



▪During 2010, average throughput on KMP’s Trans Mountain pipeline system, which transports heavy crude oil and other products from Alberta toterminals and refineries located in British Columbia, the state of Washington and the Rocky Mountains and Central regions of the United States,was approximately 297,000 barrels per day.  Total pipeline deliveries were oversubscribed for eight of the last twelve months of 2010, and over the past two years, Trans Mountain has set record loadings at the Westridge dock facility, located in Burnaby, British Columbia.



KMP Financings



▪On May 19, 2010, KMP issued a total of $1 billion in principal amount of senior notes in two separate series, consisting of $600 million of 5.30% notes due September 15, 2020, and $400 million of 6.55% notes due September 15, 2040.  KMP used the net proceeds received from this debt offering to reduce the borrowings under its commercial paper program and bank credit facility;



▪On June 23, 2010, KMP successfully renegotiated its previous $1.79 billion five-year unsecured revolving bank credit facility that was due August 18, 2010, replacing it with a new $2.0 billion three-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility that expires June 23, 2013.  Similar to the previous bank credit facility, KMP’s $2.0 billion facility is with a syndicate of financial institutions and permits it to obtain bids for fixed rate loans from members of the lending syndicate.  The covenants of this credit facility are also substantially similar to the covenants of the previous facility; however, the interest rates for borrowings under this facility have increased from KMP’s previous facility.  Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the administrative agent, and borrowings under the credit facility can be used for general partnership purposes and as a backup 
for KMP’s $2 billion commercial paper program.  As of December 31, 2010, KMP had approximately $1.2 billion of borrowing capacity available under its $2.0 billion senior unsecured revolving bank credit facility;





10



▪On November 1, 2010, KMP paid $250 million to retire the principal amount of its 7.50% senior notes that matured on that date;



▪In November 2010, KMP terminated five existing fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in five separate transactions.  These swap agreements had a combined notional principal amount of $825 million and KMP received combined proceeds of $157.6 million from the early termination of these swap agreements;



▪In 2010, KMP issued 11,569,540 common units for $758.7 million in cash, described following.  KMP used the net proceeds received from the issuance of these common units to reduce the borrowings under its commercial paper program and bank credit facility:



On May 7, 2010, KMP issued 6,500,000 of its common units at a price of $66.25 per unit. After commissions and underwriting expenses, KMP received net proceeds of $417.4 million for the issuance of these common units;



On July 2, 2010, KMP completed an offering of 1,167,315 of  its common units at a price of $64.25 per unit in a privately negotiated transaction, and KMP received net proceeds of $75.0 million for the issuance of these common units;



During 2010, KMP issued 3,902,225 of its common units pursuant to its equity distribution agreement with UBS Securities LLC.  After commissions, KMP received net proceeds of $266.3 million from the issuance of these common units; and



▪On February 23, 2011, KMP announced a public offering of senior notes. KMP expects to issue a total of $1.1 billion in principal amount of senior notes in two separate series, consisting of $500.0 million of 3.5% notes due March 1, 2016 and $600.0 million of 6.375% notes due March 1, 2041. KMP expects the offering to close on March 4, 2011.





2011 KMP Outlook



▪On November 29, 2010, KMP announced that it expected to declare cash distributions of $4.60 per unit for 2011, a 4.5% increase over its cash distributions of $4.40 per unit for 2010.



KMP’s expected growth in distributions assumes an average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price of approximately $89 per barrel in 2011.  Although the majority of the cash generated by its assets is fee based and is not sensitive to commodity prices, the CO2—KMP business segment is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of crude oil and natural gas liquids.  KMP hedges the majority of its crude oil production, but does have exposure to unhedged volumes, the majority of which are natural gas liquids volumes.  For 2011, KMP expects that every $1 change in the average WTI crude oil price per barrel will impact its CO2– KMP business segment’s cash flows b
y approximately $5.5 million (or less than 0.2% of KMP’s combined business segments’ anticipated earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses).  This sensitivity to the average WTI price is very similar to what KMP experienced in 2010.



Also on November 29, 2010, KMP announced that for the year 2011, KMP anticipates that (i) its business segments will generate approximately $3.6 billion in earnings before all non-cash depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, including amortization of excess cost of equity investments (and will generate $3.8 billion in earnings, including KMP’s share of all non-cash depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses of certain joint ventures accounted for under the equity-method of accounting); (ii) KMP will distribute approximately $1.5 billon to its limited partners and (iii) KMP will invest approximately $1.4 billion for its capital expansion program (including small acquisitions and contributions to joint ventures).  KMP anticipates 2011 expansion investment will help drive earnings and cash flow growth in 2011 and beyond, and it estimates that approximately $430 million of the e
quity required for its 2011 investment program will be funded by cash retained as a function of KMR distributions being paid in additional units rather than in cash.



In 2010, KMP’s capital expansion program was approximately $2.5 billion—including discretionary capital spending, equity contributions to its equity investees, and acquisition cash expenditures.



Other  -  2010 and 2011 Recent Developments



▪On September 8, 2010, the parties involved in our Going Private Transaction litigation entered into a $200 million settlement agreement to resolve the consolidated class action cases that were pending before the Kansas trial court.

(c) Narrative Description of Business



Business Strategy



The objective of our business strategy is to grow our portfolio of businesses by:



▪focusing on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are the core of the energy infrastructure of growing markets within North America;



▪increasing utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and employing environmentally sound operating practices;



▪leveraging economies of scale from incremental acquisitions and expansions of assets that fit within our strategy and are accretive to cash flow; and



▪maximizing the benefits of our financial structure to create and return value to our stockholders.



It is our intention to carry out the above business strategy, modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances.  However, as discussed under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below, there are factors that





12



could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out.



We (primarily through KMP) regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions.  Any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions, receipt of fairness opinions and approval of the parties’ respective boards of directors.  While there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets, such transactions can be effected quickly, may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations.



Business Segments



We own and manage a diversified portfolio of energy transportation and storage assets.  Our operations are conducted through the following reportable business segments, the first five of which are also business segments of KMP.  These business segments are as follows:



▪Products Pipelines—KMP—which consists of approximately 8,400 miles of refined petroleum products pipelines that deliver gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel and natural gas liquids to various markets; plus approximately 60 associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix processing facilities serving customers across the United States;



▪Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP—which consists of approximately 15,500 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and gathering lines, plus natural gas storage, treating and processing facilities, through which natural gas is gathered, transported, stored, treated, processed and sold;



▪CO2—KMP—which produces, markets and transports, through approximately 2,000 miles of pipelines, carbon dioxide to oil fields that use carbon dioxide to increase production of oil; owns interests in and/or operates eight oil fields in West Texas; and owns and operates a 450-mile crude oil pipeline system in West Texas;



▪Terminals—KMP— which consists of approximately 124 owned or operated liquids and bulk terminal facilities and approximately 33 rail transloading and materials handling facilities located throughout the United States and portions of Canada, which together transload, store and deliver a wide variety of bulk, petroleum, petrochemical and other liquids products for customers across the United States and Canada;



▪Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP—which transports crude oil and refined petroleum products through over 2,500 miles of pipelines from Alberta, Canada to marketing terminals and refineries in British Columbia, the state of Washington and the Rocky Mountains and Central regions of the United States;



▪NGPL PipeCo LLC—consists of our 20% interest in NGPL PipeCo LLC, the owner of Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America LLC and certain affiliates, collectively referred to as Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America or NGPL, a major interstate natural gas pipeline and storage system, which we operate.  Prior to February 15, 2008, we owned 100% of NGPL PipeCo LLC; and



▪Power—during the historical periods presented in this report, we had a business segment referred to as ‘‘Power,’’ which consisted of our ownership of natural gas-fired electric generation facilities. On October 22, 2010, we sold our facility located in Michigan, referred to as ‘‘Triton Power,’’ for approximately $15.0 million in cash, and as a result, in future periods we will no longer report Power as a business segment.



Products Pipelines—KMP



The Products Pipelines—KMP business segment consists of KMP’s refined petroleum products and natural gas liquids pipelines, their associated terminals, and its transmix processing facilities.



West Coast Products Pipelines



KMP’s West Coast Products Pipelines include the SFPP, L.P. operations (often referred to in this report as the Pacific operations), the Calnev pipeline operations, and the West Coast Terminals operations.  The assets include interstate common carrier pipelines regulated by the FERC, intrastate pipelines in the state of California regulated by the California Public Utilities Commission, and certain non rate-regulated operations and terminal facilities.



The Pacific operations serve six western states with approximately 2,500 miles of refined petroleum products pipelines and related terminal facilities that provide refined products to major population centers in the United States, including California; Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada; and the Phoenix-Tucson, Arizona corridor.  In 2010, the Pacific operations’ mainline pipeline system transported approximately 1,079,400 barrels per day of refined products, with the





13



product mix being approximately 61% gasoline, 23% diesel fuel, and 16% jet fuel.  In 2009, the Pacific operations’ pipeline system delivered approximately 1,078,800 barrels per day of refined petroleum products.



The Calnev pipeline system consists of two parallel 248-mile, 14-inch and 8-inch diameter pipelines that run from KMP’s facilities at Colton, California to Las Vegas, Nevada.  The pipeline serves the Mojave Desert through deliveries to a terminal at Barstow, California and two nearby major railroad yards.  It also serves Nellis Air Force Base, located in Las Vegas, and approximately 55 miles of pipeline serves Edwards Air Force Base.  In 2010, the Calnev pipeline system transported approximately 120,200 barrels per day of refined products, with the product mix being approximately 44% gasoline, 30% diesel fuel, and 26% jet fuel.  In 2009, the system delivered approximately 120,400 barrels per day of refined petroleum products.



TheWest Coast Products Pipelines include 15 truck-loading terminals (13 in the Pacific operations and two in Calnev) with an aggregate usable tankage capacity of approximately 15.4 million barrels.  The truck terminals provide services including short-term product storage, truck loading, vapor handling, additive injection, dye injection and ethanol blending.



The West Coast Terminals are fee-based terminals located in the Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and Los Angeles areas along the west coast of the United States.  Combined, these terminals have a total capacity of approximately 9.0 million barrels of storage for both petroleum products and chemicals. KMP’s West Coast Products Pipelines and associated West Coast Terminals together handled 16.8 million barrels of ethanol in 2010, a 46% increase when compared to the 11.5 million barrels handled in 2009.



Markets.Combined, the Pacific operations and Calnev pipeline system transport approximately 1.2 million barrels per day of refined petroleum products, providing pipeline service to approximately 28 customer-owned terminals, 11 commercial airports and 15 military bases.The pipeline systems serve approximately 72 shippers in the refined petroleum products market, the largest customers being major petroleum companies, independent refiners, and the United States military.   A substantial portion of the product volume transported is gasoline.  Demand for gasoline and, in turn, the volumes transported, depends on such factors as prevailing economic conditions, government specificat
ions and regulations, vehicular use, and purchase patterns and demographic changes in the markets served.  Certain product volumes can also experience seasonal variations and, consequently, overall delivery volumes may be lower during the first and fourth quarters of each year.



Supply.The majority of refined products supplied to the West Coast Product Pipelines come from the major refining centers around Los Angeles, San Francisco, West Texas and Puget Sound, as well as from waterborne terminals and connecting pipelines located near these refining centers.



Competition.The two most significant competitors of the Pacific and Calnev operations are (i) proprietary pipelines owned and operated by oil companies in the area where KMP’s pipelines deliver products and (ii) refineries with terminals that have trucking arrangements within KMP’s market areas.  KMP believes that high capital costs, tariff regulation, and environmental and right-of-way permitting considerations make it unlikely that a competing pipeline system comparable in size and scope to its West Coast Products Pipelines will be built in the foreseeable future.  However, the possibility of individual pipelines such as the Holly/Sinclair UNEV pipeline from Salt Lake City, Utah to Las Vegas, Nevada, being constructed or expanded
 to serve specific markets is a continuing competitive factor.



The use of trucks for product distribution from either shipper-owned proprietary terminals or from their refining centers continues to compete for short haul movements by pipeline.  The West Coast Terminal operations compete with terminals owned by its shippers and by third party terminal operators in California, Arizona and Nevada.  Competitors include Shell Oil Products U.S., BP, Wilmington Liquid Bulk Terminals (Vopak), NuStar, Pro Petroleum and Chevron.  KMP cannot predict with any certainty whether the use of short haul trucking will decrease or increase in the future.



Plantation Pipe Line Company



KMP owns approximately 51% of Plantation Pipe Line Company, the sole owner of the approximately 3,100-mile refined petroleum products Plantation pipeline system serving the southeastern United States.  KMP operates the system pursuant to agreements with Plantation and a related entity, Plantation Services LLC.  The Plantation pipeline system serves as a common carrier of refined petroleum products to various metropolitan areas, including Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and the Washington, D.C. area.  An affiliate of ExxonMobil Corporation owns the remaining approximately 49% ownership interest, and ExxonMobil has historically been one of the largest shippers on the Plantation system both in terms of volumes and revenues.





14



In 2010, Plantation delivered approximately 498,300 barrels per day of refined petroleum products, with the product mix being approximately 65% gasoline, 22% diesel fuel, and 13% jet fuel.  In 2009, Plantation delivered approximately 487,000 barrels per day of refined petroleum products.



Markets.Plantation ships products for approximately 30 companies to terminals throughout the southeastern United States.  Plantation’s principal customers are Gulf Coast refining and marketing companies, fuel wholesalers, and the United States Department of Defense.  During 2010, Plantation’s top eight shippers represented approximately 97% of total system volumes.



The eight states in which Plantation operates represent a collective pipeline demand of approximately two million barrels per day of refined petroleum products.  Plantation currently has direct access to about 1.5 million barrels per day of this overall market.  The remaining 0.5 million barrels per day of demand lies in markets (e.g., Nashville, Tennessee; North Augusta, South Carolina; Bainbridge, Georgia; and Selma, North Carolina) currently served by another pipeline company.  Plantation also delivers jet fuel to the Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and Washington, D.C. airports (Ronald Reagan National and Dulles) and military jet fuel to military facilities in the Southeast.



Supply.Products shipped on Plantation originate at various Gulf Coast refineries from which major integrated oil companies and independent refineries and wholesalers ship refined petroleum products.  Plantation is directly connected to and supplied by a total of ten major refineries representing approximately 2.5 million barrels per day of refining capacity.



Competition.Plantation competes primarily with the Colonial pipeline system, which also runs from Gulf Coast refineries throughout the southeastern United States and extends into both the mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States.



Central Florida Pipeline



KMP’s Central Florida pipeline operations consist of (i) a 110-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline that transports gasoline and ethanol; (ii) an 85-mile, 10-inch diameter pipeline that transports diesel fuel and jet fuel from Tampa to Orlando and (iii) two separate liquids terminals located in Tampa and Taft, Florida, which KMP owns and operates.



Both pipelines service KMP’s Taft terminal (located near Orlando), and the 10-inch diameter pipeline has an additional intermediate delivery point at Intercession City, Florida, and is also the sole pipeline supplying jet fuel to the Orlando International Airport in Orlando, Florida.  In 2010, the pipeline system transported approximately 104,800 barrels per day of refined products, with the product mix being approximately 69% gasoline and ethanol, 11% diesel fuel, and 20% jet fuel.  In 2009, the Central Florida pipeline system delivered approximately 107,100 barrels per day of refined petroleum products. In addition to being connected to the Tampa terminal, KMP’s Central Florida pipeline system is connected to terminals owned and operated by TransMontaigne, Citgo, BP, and Marathon Petroleum.



KMP’s Tampa terminal contains approximately 1.5 million barrels of storage capacity and is connected to two ship dock facilities in the Port of Tampa.  The terminal provides storage for gasoline, ethanol, diesel fuel and jet fuel for further movement into either trucks or into the Central Florida pipeline system, and also provides storage and truck rack blending services for bio-diesel.  KMP’s Taft terminal contains approximately 0.7 million barrels of storage capacity, for gasoline, ethanol, and diesel fuel for further movement into trucks.



Markets.The total refined petroleum products demand for the Central Florida region of the state, which includes the Tampa and Orlando markets, is estimated to be approximately 356,000 barrels per day, or 45% of the consumption of refined products in the state, and gasoline is, by far, the largest component of that demand.  KMP distributes approximately 150,000 barrels of refined petroleum products per day, including the Tampa terminal truck loadings.  The balance of the market is supplied primarily by trucking firms and marine transportation firms.  The market in Central Florida is seasonal and heavily influenced by tourism, with demand peaks in March and April during spring break and again in the summer vacation season.



Supply.The vast majority of refined petroleum products consumed in Florida are supplied via marine vessels from major refining centers in the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Mississippi and refineries in the Caribbean basin.  A lesser amount of refined petroleum products is supplied by refineries in Alabama and by Texas Gulf Coast refineries via marine vessels and through pipeline networks that extend to Bainbridge, Georgia.  The supply into Florida is generally transported by ocean-going vessels to the larger metropolitan ports, such as Tampa, Port Everglades near Miami, and Jacksonville.  Individual markets are then supplied from terminals at these ports and other smaller ports, predominately by trucks, except the Central Florida regio
n, which is served by a combination of trucks and pipelines.





15



Competition.With respect to the Central Florida pipeline system, the most significant competitors are trucking firms and marine transportation firms.  Trucking transportation is more competitive in serving markets close to the marine terminals on the east and west coasts of Florida.  KMP utilizes tariff incentives to attract volumes to the pipeline that might otherwise enter the Orlando market area by truck from Tampa or by marine vessel into Cape Canaveral.  KMP believes it is unlikely that a new pipeline system comparable in size and scope to its Central Florida pipeline system will be constructed, due to the high cost of pipeline construction, tariff regulation and environmental and right-of-way permitting in Florida.  H
owever, the possibility of such a pipeline or a smaller capacity pipeline being built is a continuing competitive factor.



With respect to KMP’s terminal operations at Tampa, the most significant competitors are proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies, such as the Citgo terminals located along the Port of Tampa, the Chevron and Motiva terminals located in Port Tampa, and terminals owned by Marathon Petroleum and BP.  These competing terminals generally support the storage requirements of their parent or affiliated companies’ refining and marketing operations and provide a mechanism for an oil company to enter into exchange contracts with third parties to serve its storage needs in markets where the oil company may not have terminal assets.



Cochin Pipeline System



KMP’s Cochin pipeline system consists of an approximately 1,900-mile, 12-inch diameter multi-product pipeline operating between Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta and Windsor, Ontario, along with five terminals.  The pipeline operates on a batched basis and has an estimated system capacity of approximately 70,000 barrels per day.  It includes 31 pump stations spaced at 60 mile intervals and five United States propane terminals.  Underground storage is available at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta and Windsor, Ontario through third parties.  In 2010 and 2009, the pipeline system transported approximately 20,000 and 29,300 barrels per day of natural gas liquids, respectively.  Further information about the Cochin system is discussed above in “—(a) General Development of Business&
#8212;Recent Developments—Products Pipelines—KMP.”



Markets.The pipeline traverses three provinces in Canada and seven states in the United States and can transport propane, butane and natural gas liquids to the midwestern United States and eastern Canadian petrochemical and fuel markets.  Current operations involve only the transportation of propane on Cochin.



Supply.Injection into the system can occur from BP, Provident, Keyera or Dow facilities with connections at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, and from Spectra at interconnects at Regina and Richardson, Saskatchewan.



Competition.The pipeline competes with railcars and Enbridge Energy Partners for natural gas liquids long-haul business from Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta and Windsor, Ontario.  The pipeline’s primary competition in the Chicago natural gas liquids market comes from the combination of the Alliance pipeline system, which brings unprocessed gas into the United States from Canada, and Aux Sable, which processes and markets the natural gas liquids in the Chicago market.



Cypress Pipeline



KMP now owns 50% of Cypress Interstate Pipeline LLC, the sole owner of the Cypress pipeline system.  The Cypress pipeline is an interstate common carrier natural gas liquids pipeline originating at storage facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas and extending 104 miles east to a connection with Westlake Chemical Corporation, a major petrochemical producer in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area.  Effective October 1, 2010, Westlake Petrochemicals LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Westlake Chemical Corporation, exercised its option to purchase from KMP a 50% ownership interest in Cypress Interstate Pipeline LLC; however, KMP remains the operator of the Cypress pipeline system.



Mont Belvieu, located approximately 20 miles east of Houston, is the largest hub for natural gas liquids gathering, transportation, fractionation and storage in the United States.  The Cypress pipeline system has a current capacity of approximately 55,000 barrels per day for natural gas liquids, and in 2010 and 2009, the system transported approximately 49,000 and 43,400 barrels per day, respectively.



Markets.The Cypress pipeline system services Westlake pursuant to the provisions of a ship-or-pay transportation agreement entered into in October 2010.  The transportation agreement expires in April 2021, and requires a minimum volume of 35,000 barrels per day.



Supply.The Cypress pipeline system originates in Mont Belvieu where it is able to receive ethane and ethane/propane mix from local storage facilities.  Mont Belvieu has facilities to fractionate natural gas liquids received from several





16



pipelines into ethane and other components.  Additionally, pipeline systems that transport natural gas liquids from major producing areas in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and the Mid-Continent region of the Unites States supply ethane and ethane/propane mix to Mont Belvieu.



Competition.The pipeline’s primary competition into the Lake Charles market comes from Louisiana onshore and offshore natural gas liquids.



Southeast Terminals



KMP’s Southeast terminal operations consist of 26 high-quality, liquid petroleum products terminals located along the Plantation/Colonial pipeline corridor in the Southeastern United States.  Combined, KMP’s Southeast terminals have a total storage capacity of approximately 8.3 million barrels.  In 2010 and 2009, these terminals transferred approximately 358,900 and 348,000 barrels of refined products per day, respectively.



Markets.  The acquisition and marketing activities of the Southeast terminal operations are focused on the Southeastern United States from Mississippi through Virginia, including Tennessee.  The primary function involves the receipt of petroleum products from common carrier pipelines, short-term storage in terminal tankage, and subsequent loading onto tank trucks.  Combined, the Southeast terminal operations have a physical presence in markets representing almost 80% of the pipeline-supplied demand in the Southeast and offer a competitive alternative to marketers seeking relationships with independent truck terminal service providers.



Beginning in 2009, the Southeast terminal operations expanded their ethanol blending and storage services into several conventional gasoline markets, and in 2010, it completed the installation of automated ethanol blending facilities at a second gasoline terminal located in Selma, North Carolina.  The Southeast terminals now have ethanol blending capabilities in 12 of the 15 markets it serves and can adjust blending ratios as needed in order to help customers meet changing regulatory requirements.  Combined, the Southeast terminal operations handled 9.0 million barrels of ethanol in 2010, a 25% increase when compared to the 7.2 million barrels handled in 2009.



Supply.Product supply is predominately from Plantation and Colonial pipelines with a number of terminals connected to both pipelines.  To the maximum extent practicable, KMP endeavors to connect the Southeast terminals to both of the Plantation and Colonial pipeline systems.  In addition to pipeline supply, KMP is also able to take marine receipts at both its Richmond and Chesapeake, Virginia terminals.



Competition.  Most of the refined petroleum products terminals in this region are owned by large oil companies (BP, Motiva, Citgo, Marathon, and Chevron) who use these assets to support their own proprietary market demands as well as product exchange activity.  These oil companies are not generally seeking third party throughput customers.  Magellan Midstream Partners and TransMontaigne Product Services represent the other significant independent terminal operators in this region.



Transmix Operations



KMP’s Transmix operations include the processing of petroleum pipeline transmix, a blend of dissimilar refined petroleum products that have become co-mingled in the pipeline transportation process.  During pipeline transportation, different products are transported through the pipelines abutting each other, and generate a volume of different mixed products called transmix.  KMP processes and separates pipeline transmix into pipeline-quality gasoline and light distillate products at six separate processing facilities located in Colton, California; Richmond, Virginia; Dorsey Junction, Maryland; Indianola, Pennsylvania; Wood River, Illinois; and Greensboro, North Carolina.  Combined, KMP’s transmix facilities processed approximately 10.4 million and 10.0 million barrels of transmix in 2010 an
d 2009, respectively.



Markets.The Gulf and East Coast refined petroleum products distribution system, particularly the Mid-Atlantic region, is the target market for KMP’s East Coast transmix processing operations.  The Mid-Continent region and the New York Harbor are the target markets for KMP’s Illinois and Pennsylvania assets, respectively.  KMP’s West Coast transmix processing operations support the markets served by its Pacific operations in Southern California.



Supply.Transmix generated by Plantation, Colonial, Explorer, Sun, Enterprise, and KMP’s Pacific operations provide the vast majority of the supply.  These suppliers are committed to the use of KMP’s transmix facilities under long-term contracts.  Individual shippers and terminal operators provide additional supply.  Shell acquires transmix for processing at Indianola, Richmond and Wood River; Colton is supplied by pipeline shippers of KMP’s Pacific operations; Dorsey Junction is supplied by Colonial Pipeline Company; and Greensboro is supplied by Plantation Pipeline Company.





17



Competition.Placid Refining is KMP’s main competitor in the Gulf Coast area.  There are various processors in the Mid-Continent region of the United States who compete with KMP’s transmix facilities, primarily ConocoPhillips, Gladieux Refining and Williams Energy Services.  Motiva Enterprises’ transmix facility located near Linden, New Jersey is the principal competition for New York Harbor transmix supply and for KMP’s Indianola facility.  A number of smaller organizations operate transmix processing facilities in the West and Southwest.  These operations compete for supply that KMP envisions as the basis for growth in the west and southwest regions of the United States.  KMP’s Colto
n processing facility also competes with major oil company refineries in California.



Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP



The Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP business segment contains both interstate and intrastate pipelines.  Its primary businesses consist of natural gas sales, transportation, storage, gathering, processing and treating.  Within this business segment, KMP owns approximately 15,500 miles of natural gas pipelines and associated storage and supply lines that are strategically located at the center of the North American pipeline grid.  KMP’s transportation network provides access to the major gas supply areas in the western United States, Texas and the Midwest, as well as major consumer markets.



Texas Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Group and Other



Texas Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Group



The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group, which operates primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast, consists of the following four natural gas pipeline systems: (i) Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline; (ii) Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline; (iii) Mier-Monterrey Mexico Pipeline and (iv) Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline.



The two largest systems in the group are the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline and the Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline.  These pipelines essentially operate as a single pipeline system, providing customers and suppliers with improved flexibility and reliability.  The combined system includes approximately 6,000 miles of intrastate natural gas pipelines with a peak transport and sales capacity of approximately 5.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and approximately 145 billion cubic feet of on-system natural gas storage capacity, including 11 billion cubic feet contracted from a third party.  In addition, the combined system, through owned assets and contractual arrangements with third parties, has the capability to process 685 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for liquids extraction and to tre
at approximately 180 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for carbon dioxide removal.



Collectively, the combined system primarily serves the Texas Gulf Coast by selling, transporting, processing and treating gas from multiple onshore and offshore supply sources to serve the Houston/Beaumont/Port Arthur/Austin industrial markets, local gas distribution utilities, electric utilities and merchant power generation markets.  It serves as a buyer and seller of natural gas, as well as a transporter of natural gas.  The purchases and sales of natural gas are primarily priced with reference to market prices in the consuming region of its system.  The difference between the purchase and sale prices is the rough equivalent of a transportation fee and fuel costs.



Included in the operations of the Kinder Morgan Tejas system is the Kinder Morgan Border Pipeline system.  Kinder Morgan Border Pipeline owns and operates an approximately 102-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline that extends from a point of interconnection with the pipeline facilities of Pemex Gas Y Petroquimica Basica at the International Border between the United States and Mexico in Hidalgo County, Texas, to a point of interconnection with other intrastate pipeline facilities of Kinder Morgan Tejas located at King Ranch, Kleberg County, Texas.  The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 300 million cubic feet of natural gas per day and is capable of importing this volume of Mexican gas into the United States or exporting this volume of gas to Mexico.



The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline consists of a 95-mile natural gas pipeline that stretches from the International Border between the United States and Mexico in Starr County, Texas, to Monterrey, Mexico and can transport up to 375 million cubic feet per day.  The pipeline connects to a 1,000-megawatt power plant complex and to the Pemex natural gas transportation system.  The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline has entered into a long-term contract (expiring in 2018) with Pemex, which has subscribed for all of the pipeline’s capacity.



The Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline consists of an 82-mile pipeline that transports natural gas from an interconnect with the facilities of Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America LLC (our 20%-owned equity investee and referred to in this report as NGPL) in Lamar County, Texas to a 1,750-megawatt electric generating facility located in Forney, Texas, 15 miles east of Dallas, Texas.  It has the capacity to transport 325 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and is fully subscribed under a long-term contract that expires in 2032.  The system is bi-directional, permitting deliveries of additional supply from the Barnett Shale area to NGPL’s pipeline as well as power plants in the area.





18



The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group also owns and operates various gathering systems in southern and eastern Texas.  These systems aggregate natural gas supplies into the Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group’s main transmission pipelines, and in certain cases, aggregate natural gas that must be processed or treated at its own or third-party facilities.  The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group owns plants that can process up to 135 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for liquids extraction, and has contractual rights to process approximately 550 million cubic feet per day of natural gas at third-party owned facilities.  The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group also shares in gas processing margins on gas processed at certain third-party owned facilities.
60; Additionally, the Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group owns and operates three natural gas treating plants that provide carbon dioxide and/or hydrogen sulfide removal.  The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group can treat up to 85 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for carbon dioxide removal at its plant in Fandango Complex in Zapata County, Texas, 50 million cubic feet per day of natural gas at its Indian Rock Plant in Upshur County, Texas and approximately 45 million cubic feet per day of natural gas at its Thompsonville Facility located in Jim Hogg County, Texas.



The North Dayton natural gas storage facility, located in Liberty County, Texas, has three storage caverns providing approximately 16.5 billion cubic feet of total capacity, consisting of 11.0 billion cubic feet of working capacity and 5.5 billion cubic feet of cushion gas.



KMP also owns the West Clear Lake natural gas storage facility located in Harris County, Texas, and KMP leases five salt dome caverns located near Markham, Texas in Matagorda County, and two salt dome caverns located in Brazoria County, Texas.  Pursuant to a long term contract that expires in 2012, Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. operates and controls the 96 billion cubic feet of natural gas working capacity at the West Clear Lake facility, and KMP provides transportation service into and out of the facility.  KMP leases the natural gas storage capacity at the Markham facility from Texas Brine Company, LLC according to the provisions of an operating lease that expires in March 2013, and KMP can, at its sole option, extend the term of this lease for two additional ten-year periods.  The facility 
consists of five salt dome caverns with approximately 22.0 billion cubic feet of working natural gas capacity and up to 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of peak deliverability.  KMP leases the two storage caverns located in Brazoria County, Texas (known as the Stratton Ridge facilities) from Ineos USA, LLC.  The Stratton Ridge facilities have a combined working natural gas capacity of 1.4 billion cubic feet and a peak day deliverability of 100 million cubic feet per day.  In addition to the aforementioned storage facilities, KMP contracts for storage services from third parties.



Additionally, KMP’s intrastate group owns both a 40% equity ownership interest in Endeavor Gathering LLC (acquired on November 1, 2009) and a 50% equity ownership interest in Eagle Ford Gathering LLC (formed on May 14, 2010).  Endeavor Gathering LLC provides natural gas gathering service to GMX Resources’ exploration and production activities in its Cotton Valley Sands and Haynesville/Bossier Shale horizontal well developments located in East Texas.  GMX Resources operates and owns the remaining 60% ownership interest in Endeavor Gathering LLC.  Further information about Eagle Ford Gathering LLC is discussed above in “—(a) General Development of Business—Recent Developments—Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP.”



Markets.Texas is one of the largest natural gas consuming states in the country.  The natural gas demand profile in KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group’s market area is primarily composed of industrial (including on-site cogeneration facilities), merchant and utility power, and local natural gas distribution consumption.  The industrial demand is primarily year-round load.  Merchant and utility power demand peaks in the summer months and is complemented by local natural gas distribution demand that peaks in the winter months.  As new merchant gas fired generation has come online and displaced traditional utility generation, KMP has successfully attached many of these new generation facilities to it
s natural gas pipeline systems in order to maintain and grow its share of natural gas supply for power generation.



KMP serves the Mexico market through interconnection with the facilities of Pemex at the United States-Mexico border near Arguellas, Mexico and its Mier-Monterrey Mexico pipeline.  In 2010, deliveries through the existing interconnection near Arguellas fluctuated from zero to approximately 276 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.  Deliveries to Monterrey also ranged from zero to 338 million cubic feet per day.  KMP primarily provides transport service to these markets on a fee for service basis, including a significant demand component, which is paid regardless of actual throughput.  Revenues earned from activities in Mexico are paid in U.S. dollar equivalent.



Supply.KMP purchases natural gas directly from producers attached to its system in South Texas, East Texas, West Texas, and along the Texas Gulf Coast.  In addition, KMP also purchases gas at interconnects with third-party interstate and intrastate pipelines.  While the intrastate group does not produce gas, it does maintain an active well connection program in order to offset natural declines in production along its system and to secure supplies for additional demand in its market area.  The intrastate system has access to both onshore and offshore sources of supply and liquefied natural gas from the Freeport LNG terminal near Freeport, Texas and from the Golden Pass LNG terminal located near Sabine Pass,





19



Texas.



Competition.The Texas intrastate natural gas market is highly competitive, with many markets connected to multiple pipeline companies.  KMP competes with interstate and intrastate pipelines, and their shippers, for attachments to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services.



Kinder Morgan Treating L.P.



KMP believes it has the largest contracted natural gas treating fleet operation in the United States.  KMP’s subsidiary, Kinder Morgan Treating, L.P., owns and operates (or leases to producers for operation) treating plants that remove impurities (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) from natural gas before it is delivered into gathering systems and transmission pipelines to ensure that it meets pipeline quality specifications.  Its primary treating assets include approximately 212 natural gas amine-treating plants and approximately 56 dew point control plants.  In addition, effective September 1, 2010, it acquired the natural gas treating assets of Gas-Chill, Inc., as discussed above in “—(a) General Development of Business—Recent Developments—Natural Gas Pipelines—
;KMP.”



The amine treating process involves a continuous circulation of a liquid chemical called amine that physically contacts with the natural gas.  Amine has a chemical affinity for hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide that allows it to remove these impurities from the gas.  After mixing, gas and reacted amine are separated and the impurities are removed from the amine by heating. Treating plants are sized by the amine circulation capacity in terms of gallons per minute.



Dew point control is complementary to KMP’s treating business, as pipeline companies enforce gas quality specifications to lower the hydrocarbon dew point of the gas they receive and transport.  A higher relative dew point can sometimes cause liquid hydrocarbons to condense in the pipeline and cause operating problems and gas quality issues to the downstream markets.  Hydrocarbon dew point plants, which consist of skid mounted processing equipment, remove these hydrocarbons.  These plants lower the temperature of the gas stream and collect the liquids before they enter the downstream pipeline.  As of December 31, 2010, KMP had approximately 268 treating and hydrocarbon dew point control plants in operation. KMP typically charges a fixed monthly rental fee plus, in those instances 
where it operates the equipment, a fixed monthly operating fee.



Supply.Natural gas from certain formations is high in carbon dioxide, which generally needs to be removed before introduction of the gas into transportation pipelines.  Many of KMP’s active plants are treating natural gas from the Wilcox and Edwards gas formations in the Texas Gulf Coast, and the Haynesville shale gas formation in North Louisiana and East Texas, all of which are deep formations that are high in carbon dioxide.



Markets.Shale reservoirs being developed today have concentrations of carbon dioxide above the normal pipeline quality specifications of 2.0%.  The Eagle Ford shale gas formation in South Texas and the Bossier shale gas formation in North Louisiana and East Texas are experiencing robust development, and KMP believes that its treating business strategy is well suited to the producers in these areas.



Competition.KMP’s natural gas treating operations face competition from manufacturers of new treating and hydrocarbon dew point control plants and from a number of regional operators that provide plants and similar operations.  KMP also faces competition from vendors of used equipment that occasionally operate plants for producers.  In addition, KMP may lose business to natural gas gatherers who have underutilized treating or processing capacity.  KMP may also lose wellhead treating opportunities to blending, which is a pipeline company’s ability to waive quality specifications and allow producers to deliver their contaminated natural gas untreated. This is generally referred to as blending because of the receiving company’s a
bility to blend this natural gas with cleaner natural gas in the pipeline such that the resulting natural gas meets pipeline specification.



KinderHawk Field Services LLC



In May 2010, KMP’s subsidiary KM Gathering LLC purchased a 50% ownership interest in KinderHawk Field Services LLC, which gathers and treats natural gas in the Haynesville shale gas formation located in northwest Louisiana.  A subsidiary of Petrohawk Energy Corporation owns the remaining 50% ownership interest.



KinderHawk’s assets consist of more than 365 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline currently in service, with projected average throughput of approximately one billion cubic feet per day of natural gas in 2011.  Ultimately, KinderHawk is expected to have approximately two billion cubic feet per day of throughput capacity, which will make it one of the largest natural gas gathering and treating systems in the United States.  Additionally, the system’s natural gas amine treating plants have a current capacity of approximately 2,160 gallons per minute.





20



KinderHawk received a dedication to gather and treat all of Petrohawk’s operated Haynesville and Bossier shale gas production in northwest Louisiana for the life of the leases at agreed upon rates, as well as minimum volume commitments from Petrohawk for the first five years of the joint venture agreement.  Since KMP’s acquisition, KinderHawk also secured additional new third-party gas gathering and treating commitments.  These contracts provide for the dedication of 17 sections, from three shippers, for three- to ten-year terms.  The anticipated daily volume from third-parties could approach over 200 million cubic feet per day of natural gas depending on expected drill schedules and operational techniques.



Upstream



KMP’s Natural Gas Pipelines’ upstream operations consist of its Casper and Douglas, Wyoming natural gas processing operations and its 49% ownership interest in the Red Cedar Gas Gathering Company.



Casper and Douglas Natural Gas Processing Systems



KMP owns and operates its Casper and Douglas, Wyoming natural gas processing plants, and combined, these plants have the capacity to process up to 185 million cubic feet per day of natural gas depending on raw gas quality.  KMP also owns the operations of a carbon dioxide/sulfur treating facility located in the West Frenchie Draw field of the Wind River Basin of Wyoming, and it includes this facility as part of its Casper and Douglas operations.  The West Frenchie Draw treating facility has a capacity of 50 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.



Markets.Casper and Douglas are processing plants servicing natural gas streams flowing into KMP’s KMIGT pipeline system.  Natural gas liquids processed by the Casper plant are sold into local markets consisting primarily of retail propane dealers and oil refiners.  Natural gas liquids processed by the Douglas plant are sold to ConocoPhillips via its Powder River natural gas liquids pipeline for either ultimate consumption at the Borger refinery or for further disposition to the natural gas liquids trading hubs located in Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas.  West Frenchie Draw has full capacity dedication through 2014 with two of the area’s major natural gas producers: Encana and ExxonMobil.  It treats a natu
ral gas stream which contains approximately 4% carbon dioxide down to KMIGT’s pipeline specification of 2%.  The facility’s only outlet feeds into the KMIGT system.



Competition.Other regional facilities in the Greater Powder River Basin include (i) the Rawlins plant, which has a processing capacity of approximately 230 million cubic feet per day and is owned and operated by El Paso; (ii) the Sage Creek plant, which has a processing capacity of approximately 50 million cubic feet per day and is owned and operated by Merit Energy and (iii) the Hilight plant, which has a processing capacity of approximately 30 million cubic feet per day and is owned and operated by Western Gas Partners, L.P.  Casper and Douglas, however, are the only plants which provide straddle processing of natural gas flowing into the KMIGT pipeline system.



Red Cedar Gathering Company



KMP owns a 49% equity interest in the Red Cedar Gathering Company, a joint venture organized in August 1994 and referred to in this report as Red Cedar.  Red Cedar owns and operates natural gas gathering, compression and treating facilities in the Ignacio Blanco Field in La Plata County, Colorado.  The Ignacio Blanco Field lies within the Colorado portion of the San Juan Basin, most of which is located within the exterior boundaries of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe Reservation.  The remaining 51% interest in Red Cedar is owned by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.



Red Cedar gathers coal seam and conventional natural gas at wellheads and several central delivery points for treating, compression and delivery into any one of three major interstate natural gas pipeline systems and an intrastate pipeline.  Red Cedar’s natural gas gathering system currently consists of approximately 743 miles of gathering pipeline connecting more than 1,200 producing wells, 89,400 horsepower of compression at 21 field compressor stations and two carbon dioxide treating plants.  The capacity and throughput of the Red Cedar gathering system is approximately 750 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.



Red Cedar also owns Coyote Gas Treating, LLC.  The sole asset owned by Coyote Gas Treating, LLC is a 175 million cubic feet per day natural gas treating facility located in La Plata County, Colorado.  The inlet gas stream treated by this plant contains an average carbon dioxide content of between 12% and 13%, and the plant treats the gas down to a carbon dioxide concentration of 2% in order to meet interstate natural gas pipeline quality specifications.  It then compresses the natural gas into KMP’s TransColorado pipeline system for transport to the Blanco, New Mexico-San Juan Basin Hub.





21



Western Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Group



KMP’s Western interstate natural gas pipeline group, which operates primarily along the Rocky Mountain region of the Western portion of the United States, consists of the following three natural gas pipeline systems (i) the Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission Pipeline; (ii) the TransColorado Pipeline and (iii) KMP’s 50% ownership interest in the Rockies Express Pipeline.



Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC



KMP’s subsidiary, KMIGT, owns approximately 5,300 miles of transmission lines in Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska.  The KMIGT pipeline system is powered by 25 transmission and storage compressor stations having approximately 157,000 horsepower.  KMIGT also owns the Huntsman natural gas storage facility, located in Cheyenne County, Nebraska, which has approximately 34.8 billion cubic feet of total capacity, consisting of 14.8 billion cubic feet of working capacity and 20.0 billion cubic feet of cushion gas.  KMIGT has 11 billion cubic feet of firm capacity commitments and provides for withdrawals of up to 179 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.



Under transportation agreements and FERC tariff provisions, KMIGT offers its customers firm and interruptible transportation and storage services, including no-notice service and park and loan services.  For these services, KMIGT charges rates which include the retention of fuel and gas lost and unaccounted for in-kind.  Under KMIGT’s tariffs, firm transportation and storage customers pay reservation charges each month plus a commodity charge based on the actual transported or stored volumes.  In contrast, interruptible transportation and storage customers pay a commodity charge based upon actual transported and/or stored volumes.  Under the no-notice service, customers pay a fee for the right to use a combination of firm storage and firm transportation to effect deliveries of natural 
gas up to a specified volume without making specific nominations.  KMIGT also has the authority to make gas purchases and sales, as needed for system operations, pursuant to its currently effective FERC gas tariff.



The KMIGT system also offers its Cheyenne Market Center service, which provides nominated storage and transportation service between its Huntsman storage field and multiple interconnecting pipelines at the Cheyenne Hub, located in Weld County, Colorado.  This service is fully subscribed through May 2014.  Additionally, the KMIGT pipeline system includes the Colorado Lateral, which is a 41-mile, 12-inch pipeline extending from the Cheyenne Hub southward to the Greeley, Colorado area.  The Colorado Lateral serves Atmos Energy under a long-term firm transportation contract, and KMIGT is currently marketing additional capacity along its route.



Markets.Markets served by the KMIGT pipeline system provide a stable customer base with expansion opportunities due to the system’s access to Rocky Mountain supply sources.  Markets served by the system are comprised mainly of local natural gas distribution companies and interconnecting interstate pipelines in the mid-continent area.  End-users of the local natural gas distribution companies typically include residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural customers.  The pipelines interconnecting with the KMIGT system in turn deliver gas into multiple markets including some of the largest population centers in the Midwest.  Natural gas demand to power pumps for crop irrigation during the summer from time-to-time
 exceeds heating season demand and provides KMIGT relatively consistent volumes throughout the year.  KMIGT has also seen a significant increase in demand from ethanol producers, and has expanded its system to meet the demands from the ethanol producing community.



Supply.As of December 31, 2010, approximately 8%, by volume, of KMIGT’s contracted firm transport capacity expires within one year and 60% expires between one and five years.  Over 90% of the system’s total firm transport capacity is currently subscribed, with71% of KMIGT’s transport business in 2010 being conducted with its top ten shippers.



Competition.KMIGT competes with other interstate and intrastate gas pipelines transporting gas from the supply sources in the Rocky Mountain and Hugoton Basins to mid-continent pipelines and market centers.



TransColorado Gas Transmission Company LLC



KMP’s subsidiary, TransColorado Gas Transmission Company LLC, referred to in this report as TransColorado, owns a 300-mile interstate natural gas pipeline that extends from approximately 20 miles southwest of Meeker, Colorado to the Blanco Hub near Bloomfield, New Mexico.  It has multiple points of interconnection with various interstate and intrastate pipelines, gathering systems, and local distribution companies.  The TransColorado pipeline system is powered by eight compressor stations having an aggregate of approximately 39,000 horsepower.





22



The TransColorado system has the ability to flow gas south or north.  It receives gas from a single coal seam natural gas treating plant, located in the San Juan Basin of Colorado, and from pipeline, processing plant and gathering system interconnections within the Paradox and Piceance Basins of western Colorado.  Natural gas transmitted south through the pipeline system flows into the El Paso, Transwestern and Questar Southern Trail pipeline systems.  Natural gas transmitted north through the system flows into the Colorado Interstate, Wyoming Interstate and Questar pipeline systems at the Greasewood Hub, and into the Rockies Express pipeline system at the Meeker Hub.  TransColorado provides transportation services to third-party natural gas producers, marketers, gathering companies, local d
istribution companies and other shippers.



Pursuant to transportation agreements and FERC tariff provisions, TransColorado offers its customers firm and interruptible transportation and interruptible park and loan services.  The underlying reservation and commodity charges are assessed pursuant to a maximum recourse rate structure, which does not vary based on the distance gas is transported.  TransColorado has the authority to negotiate rates with customers if it has first offered service to those customers under its reservation and commodity charge rate structure.



Markets.The TransColorado system acts principally as a feeder pipeline system from the developing natural gas supply basins on the Western Slope of Colorado into the interstate natural gas pipelines that lead away from the Blanco Hub area of New Mexico and the interstate natural gas pipelines that lead away eastward from northwestern Colorado and southwestern Wyoming.  TransColorado is one of the largest transporters of natural gas from the Western Slope supply basins of Colorado and provides a competitively attractive outlet for that developing natural gas resource.  In 2010 and 2009, TransColorado transported an average of approximately 472 million and 617 million cubic feet per day, respectively, of natural gas from these supply basins.



Supply.During 2010, 95% of TransColorado’s transport business was with processors or producers or their own marketing affiliates, and 5% was with marketing companies and various gas marketers.  Approximately 65% of TransColorado’s transport business in 2010 was conducted with its three largest customers.  Nearly all of TransColorado’s long-haul southbound pipeline capacity is committed under firm transportation contracts that extend at least through year-end 2011.  As of December 31, 2010, approximately 2%, by volume, of TransColorado’s firm transportation contracts expire within one year, and 64% expire between one and five years; however, TransColorado is actively pursuing contract extensions and/or replacement contrac
ts to increase firm subscription levels beyond 2011.



Competition.The TransColorado system competes with other transporters of natural gas in each of the natural gas supply basins it serves.  These competitors include both interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and natural gas gathering systems.  TransColorado’s shippers compete for market share with shippers drawing upon gas production facilities within the New Mexico portion of the San Juan Basin.  TransColorado has phased its past construction and expansion efforts to coincide with the ability of the interstate pipeline grid at Blanco, New Mexico and at the north end of its system to accommodate greater natural gas volumes.  Historically, the competition faced by TransColorado with respect to its natural gas 
transportation services has generally been based upon the price differential between the San Juan and Rocky Mountain Basins.  New pipelines servicing these producing basins and a reduction of rigs drilling in this area for gas have had the effect of reducing that price differential.



Rockies Express Pipeline



KMP operates and owns 50% of the 1,679-mile Rockies Express natural gas pipeline system, one of the largest natural gas pipelines ever constructed in North America.  The system is powered by 18 compressor stations totaling approximately 427,000 horsepower, and the system is capable of transporting 1.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas.



KMP’s ownership is through its 50% equity interest in Rockies Express Pipeline LLC, the sole owner of the Rockies Express pipeline system and referred to in this report as Rockies Express.  The Rockies Express system has binding firm commitments secured for nearly all of the 1.8 billion cubic feet per day of pipeline capacity.  Sempra Pipelines & Storage (25%), a unit of Sempra Energy, and ConocoPhillips (25%) hold the remaining ownership interests in Rockies Express.



Markets.Rockies Express is capable of delivering gas to multiple markets along its pipeline system, primarily through interconnects with other interstate pipeline companies and direct connects to local distribution companies.  The system’s Zone 1 encompasses receipts and deliveries of natural gas west of the Cheyenne Hub, located in Northern Colorado near Cheyenne, Wyoming.  Through the Zone 1 facilities, the Rockies Express system can deliver gas to KMP’s TransColorado pipeline system in northwestern Colorado, which can in turn transport the gas further south for delivery into the San Juan Basin area.  In Zone 1, the Rockies Express system can also deliver gas into western Wyoming through leased capacity on the Overthrus
t Pipeline Company system, or through its interconnections with Colorado Interstate Gas Company and Wyoming Interstate Company in southern Wyoming.  In addition, through the system’s Zone 1 facilities,





23



shippers have the ability to deliver natural gas to points at the Cheyenne Hub, which could be used in markets along the Front Range of Colorado, or could be transported further east through the system’s Zone 2 (Rockies Express-West pipeline segment) and Zone 3 (Rockies Express-East pipeline segment) facilities into other pipeline systems.



The Rockies Express-West facilities extend from the Cheyenne Hub to an interconnect with Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Company in Audrain County, Missouri.  Through the Rockies Express-West facilities, the system facilitates the delivery of natural gas into the Mid-Continent region of the Unites States through various interconnects with other major interstate pipelines in Nebraska (Northern Natural Gas Pipeline and NGPL), Kansas (ANR Pipeline), and Missouri (Panhandle Eastern Pipeline), and through a connection with KMP’s subsidiary, KMIGT.



The Rockies Express-East facilities extend eastward from the terminus of the Rockies Express-West line.  The Rockies Express-East facilities permit natural gas delivery to pipelines and local distribution companies providing service to the midwestern and eastern U.S. markets.  The interconnecting interstate pipelines include Missouri Gas Pipeline, NGPL, Midwestern Gas Transmission, Trunkline, Panhandle Eastern Pipeline, ANR, Columbia Gas, Dominion Transmission, Tennessee Gas, Texas Eastern, and Texas Gas Transmission.  The local distribution companies include Ameren, Vectren, and Dominion East Ohio.



Supply.The Rockies Express pipeline system directly accesses major gas supply basins in western Colorado and western Wyoming.  In western Colorado, the system has access to gas supply from the Uinta and Piceance Basins in eastern Utah and western Colorado.  In western Wyoming, the system accesses the Green River Basin through its facilities that are leased from Overthrust.  With its connections to numerous other pipeline systems along its route, the Rockies Express system has access to almost all of the major gas supply basins in Wyoming, Colorado and eastern Utah.



Competition.Capacity on the Rockies Express system is nearly fully contracted under ten year firm service agreements with producers from the Rocky Mountain supply basin.  These agreements expire in2019 and provide the pipeline with fixed monthly reservation revenues for the primary term of such contracts.  Although there are other pipeline competitors providing transportation from Rocky Mountain supply basins, the Rockies Express system was designed and constructed to realize economies of scale and offers its shippers competitive fuel rates and variable costs to transport gas supplies from the Rockies to Midwestern and Eastern markets.  Other pipelines accessing the Rocky 
Mountain gas supply basins include Questar Pipeline Company, Wyoming Interstate, Colorado Interstate Gas Company, Kern River Gas Pipeline Company, Northwest Pipeline, Bison Pipeline and the Ruby Pipeline, a 680-mile natural gas pipeline currently under construction.  The Ruby Pipeline will extend from Opal, Wyoming to Malin, Oregon and is estimated to begin service in the spring of 2011.



Central Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Group



KMP’s Central interstate natural gas pipeline group, which operates primarily in the Mid-Continent region of the United States, consists of the following four natural gas pipeline systems (i) the Trailblazer Pipeline; (ii) the Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline; (iii) KMP’s 50% ownership interest in the Midcontinent Express Pipeline and (iv) KMP’s 50% ownership interest in the Fayetteville Express Pipeline.



Trailblazer Pipeline Company LLC



KMP’s subsidiary, Trailblazer Pipeline Company LLC, referred to in this report as Trailblazer, owns the 436-mile Trailblazer natural gas pipeline system.  The Trailblazer pipeline system originates at an interconnection with Wyoming Interstate Company Ltd.’s pipeline system near Rockport, Colorado and runs through southeastern Wyoming to a terminus near Beatrice, Nebraska where it interconnects with NGPL’s and Northern Natural Gas Company’s pipeline systems.  We manage, maintain and operate the Trailblazer system for KMP, for which we are reimbursed at cost.  Trailblazer offers its customers firm and interruptible transportation, and in 2010, it transported an average of approximately 849 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.  In 2009, Trailblazer transported an 
average of approximately 866 million cubic feet per day.



Markets.Significant growth in Rocky Mountain natural gas supplies has prompted a need for additional pipeline transportation service.  The Trailblazer system has a certificated capacity of 846 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.



Supply.As of December 31, 2010, none of Trailblazer’s firm contracts, by volume, expire before one year and 58%, by volume, expire within one to five years.  Affiliated entities have contracted for less than 1% of the total firm transportation capacity.  All of the system’s firm transport capacity is currently subscribed.





24



Competition.The main competition that Trailblazer currently faces is that the gas supply in the Rocky Mountain area is transported on competing pipelines to the west or east.  El Paso’s Cheyenne Plains Pipeline can transport approximately 730 million cubic feet per day of natural gas from Weld County, Colorado to Greensburg, Kansas, and the Rockies Express pipeline system (discussed above) can transport 1.8 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas from the Rocky Mountain area to Midwest markets.  These two systems compete with Trailblazer for natural gas pipeline transportation demand from the Rocky Mountain region.  Additional competition could come from other proposed pipeline projects.  No assurance can be given that additio
nal competing pipelines will not be developed in the future.



Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline



KMP’s subsidiary, Kinder Morgan Louisiana Pipeline LLC owns the Kinder Morgan Louisiana natural gas pipeline system.  The pipeline system provides approximately 3.2 billion cubic feet per day of take-away natural gas capacity from the Cheniere Sabine Pass liquefied natural gas terminal located in Cameron Parish, Louisiana.  The system capacity is fully supported by 20 year take-or-pay customer commitments with Chevron and Total that expire in 2029.



The Kinder Morgan Louisiana pipeline system consists of two segments.  The first is a 132-mile, 42-inch diameter pipeline with firm capacity of approximately 2.0 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas that extends from the Sabine Pass terminal to a point of interconnection with an existing Columbia Gulf Transmission line in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana (an offshoot consists of approximately 2.3 miles of 24-inch diameter pipeline with firm peak day capacity of approximately 300 million cubic feet per day extending away from the 42-inch diameter line to the Florida Gas Transmission Company compressor station located in Acadia Parish, Louisiana).  The second segment is a one-mile, 36-inch diameter pipeline with firm capacity of approximately 1.2 billion cubic feet per day that extends from the Sabine Pass termi
nal and connects to NGPL’s natural gas pipeline.



Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC



KMP owns a 50% interest in Midcontinent Express Pipeline LLC, the sole owner of the approximate 500-mile Midcontinent Express natural gas pipeline system.  KMP also operates the Midcontinent Express pipeline system.  Regency Midcontinent Express Pipeline I LLC and ETC Midcontinent Express Pipeline II L.L.C. own the remaining 49.9% and 0.1%, respectively.



The Midcontinent Express pipeline system originates near Bennington, Oklahoma and extends eastward through Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and terminates at an interconnection with the Transco Pipeline near Butler, Alabama.  In June 2010, Midcontinent Express completed two natural gas compression projects that increased Zone 1 capacity from 1.5 to 1.8 billion cubic feet per day, and Zone 2 capacity from 1.0 to 1.2 billion cubic feet per day.  The incremental capacity is fully subscribed with ten-year binding shipper agreements with creditworthy shippers.



Competition.Capacity on the Midcontinent Express system is 99% contracted under long-term firm service agreements.  The majority of volume is contracted to producers moving supply from the Barnett shale and from Oklahoma supply basins.  These agreements provide the pipeline with fixed monthly reservation revenues for the primary term of such contracts.  Although there are other pipeline competitors providing transportation from these supply basins, the Midcontinent Express system was designed and constructed to realize economies of scale and offers its shippers competitive fuel rates and variable costs to transport gas supplies from these midcontinent supply areas to pipelines serving Eastern markets.  Competitors to Midcontinent Expr
ess include Gulf Crossing Pipeline, Centerpoint Energy Gas Transmission and NGPL.



Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC



KMP owns a 50% interest in Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, the sole owner of the Fayetteville Express natural gas pipeline system. The 187-mile Fayetteville Express pipeline system originates in Conway County, Arkansas, continues eastward through White County, Arkansas, and terminates at an interconnect with Trunkline Gas Company’s pipeline in Panola County, Mississippi.  The system also interconnects with NGPL’s pipeline in White County, Arkansas, Texas Gas Transmission’s pipeline in Coahoma County, Mississippi, and ANR Pipeline Company’s pipeline in Quitman County, Mississippi.It has a total capacity of two billion cubic feet per day, and has currently secured binding shipper commitments for approxim
ately ten years totaling 1.85 billion cubic feet per day of capacity.



CO2—KMP



The CO2—KMP business segment consists of Kinder Morgan CO2Company, L.P. and its consolidated affiliates, referred to as KMCO2in this report.  Carbon dioxide is used in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for





25



recovering crude oil from mature oil fields.  The carbon dioxide pipelines and related assets allow KMP to market a complete package of carbon dioxide supply, transportation and technical expertise to the customer.  The CO2—KMP business segment produces, transports and markets carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery operations.  KMCO2also holds ownership interests in several oil-producing fields and owns a crude oil pipeline, all located in the Permian Basin region of West Texas.



Oil Producing Activities



KMCO2holds ownership interests in oil-producing fields, including (i) an approximate 97% working interest in the SACROC unit; (ii) an approximate 50% working interest in the Yates unit; (iii) an approximate 21% net profits interest in the H.T. Boyd unit; (iv) an approximate 65% working interest in the Claytonville unit; (v) an approximate 99% working interest in the Katz Strawn unit and (vi) lesser interests in the Sharon Ridge unit, the Reinecke unit and the MidCross unit, all of which are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas.



The SACROC unit is one of the largest and oldest oil fields in the United States using carbon dioxide flooding technology.  The field is comprised of approximately 56,000 acres located in the Permian Basin in Scurry County, Texas.  SACROC was discovered in 1948 and has produced over 1.33 billion barrels of oil since discovery.  It is estimated that SACROC originally held approximately 2.7 billion barrels of oil.  KMP has expanded the development of the carbon dioxide project initiated by the previous owners and increased production and ultimate oil recovery over the last several years.  The Yates unit is also one of the largest oil fields ever discovered in the United States.  It is estimated that it originally held more than five billion barrels of oil, of which about 29
% has been produced.  The field, discovered in 1926, is comprised of approximately 26,000 acres located about 90 miles south of Midland, Texas.



In 2010, the average purchased carbon dioxide injection rate at SACROC was 220 million cubic feet per day, down from an average of 253 million cubic feet per day in 2009.  The average oil production rate for 2010 was approximately 29,200 barrels of oil per day, down from an average of approximately 30,100 barrels of oil per day during 2009.



KMP’s plan over the last several years has been to maintain overall production levels and increase ultimate recovery from Yates by combining horizontal drilling with carbon dioxide injection to ensure a relatively steady production profile over the next several years.  KMP is implementing its plan and during 2010, the Yates unit produced approximately 24,000 barrels of oil per day, down from an average of approximately 26,500 barrels of oil per day during 2009.  Unlike KMP’s operations at SACROC, where it uses carbon dioxide and water to drive oil to the producing wells, KMP uses carbon dioxide at Yates in order to enhance the gravity drainage process, as well as to maintain reservoir pressure.  The differences in geology and reservoir mechanics between the two fields mean that substantial
ly less capital will be needed to develop and produce the reserves at Yates than is required at SACROC.



KMP also operates and owns an approximate 65% gross working interest in the Claytonville oil field unit located in Fisher County, Texas.  The Claytonville unit is located nearly 30 miles east of the SACROC unit in the Permian Basin of West Texas, and the unit produced 203 barrels of oil per day during 2010, down from an average of 218 barrels of oil per day during 2009. KMP is presently evaluating operating and subsurface technical data from the Claytonville unit to further assess redevelopment opportunities including carbon dioxide flood operations.



KMP also operates and owns working interests in the Katz Strawn unit.  The Katz Strawn unit is located in the Permian Basin area of West Texas and during 2010, the unit produced 284 barrels of oil per day, down from an average of 380 barrels of oil per day during 2009.  The decline was primarily due to transition operations associated with converting from water injection to carbon dioxide injection. In July 2009, KMP announced major investment plans to further expand its operations in the eastern Permian Basin area of Texas, and further information on this investment is discussed above in “—(a) General Development of Business—Recent Developments—CO2—KMP.”



The following table sets forth productive wells, service wells and drilling wells in the oil and gas fields in which KMP owns interests as of December 31, 2010.  The oil and gas producing fields in which KMP owns interests are located in the Permian Basin area of West Texas.  When used with respect to acres or wells, “gross” refers to the total acres or wells in which KMP has a working interest, and “net” refers to gross acres or wells multiplied, in each case, by the percentage working interest owned by KMP:

See Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information with respect to operating statistics and supplemental information on KMP’s oil and gas producing activities.



Gas and Gasoline Plant Interests



KMP operates and owns an approximate 22% working interest plus an additional 28% net profits interest in the Snyder gasoline plant.  KMP also operates and owns a 51% ownership interest in the Diamond M gas plant and a 100% ownership interest in the North Snyder plant, all of which are located in the Permian Basin of West Texas.  The Snyder gasoline plant processes natural gas produced from the SACROC unit and neighboring carbon dioxide projects, specifically the Sharon Ridge and Cogdell units, all of which are located in the Permian Basin area of West Texas.  The Diamond M and the North Snyder plants contract with the Snyder plant to process natural gas.  Production of natural gas liquids at the Snyder gasoline plant during December 2010 was approximately 16,100 barrels per day, compared to 
14,500 barrels per day in December 2009.



Carbon Dioxide Reserves



KMP owns approximately 45% of, and operates, the McElmo Dome unit in Colorado, which contains more than seven trillion cubic feet of recoverable carbon dioxide.  Deliverability and compression capacity exceeds 1,300 million cubic feet per day.  The McElmo Dome unit produces approximately 1,200 million cubic feet per day.





27



KMP also owns approximately 11% of the Bravo Dome unit in New Mexico and approximately 87% of the Doe Canyon Deep unit in Colorado.  The Bravo Dome unit contains more than 900 billion cubic feet of recoverable carbon dioxide and produces approximately 300 million cubic feet of carbon dioxide per day; the Doe Canyon Deep unit contains more than 900 billion cubic feet of carbon dioxide and produces approximately 110 million cubic feet per day.



Markets.KMP’s principal market for carbon dioxide is for injection into mature oil fields in the Permian Basin, where industry demand is expected to remain strong for the next several years.   KMP is exploring additional potential markets, including enhanced oil recovery targets in California, Wyoming, Oklahoma, the Gulf Coast, Mexico, and Canada, and coal bed methane production in the San Juan Basin of New Mexico.



Competition.KMP’s primary competitors for the sale of carbon dioxide include suppliers that have an ownership interest in McElmo Dome, Bravo Dome and Sheep Mountain carbon dioxide reserves, and PetroSource Energy Company, L.P. and its parent SandRidge Energy, Inc., which produce waste carbon dioxide from natural gas production in the Val Verde Basin and the Pinion field areas of West Texas.  There is no assurance that new carbon dioxide sources will not be discovered or developed, which could compete with KMP, or that new methodologies for enhanced oil recovery will not replace carbon dioxide flooding.



Carbon Dioxide Pipelines



As a result of KMP’s 50% ownership interest in Cortez Pipeline Company, it owns a 50% equity interest in and operates the approximate 500-mile Cortez pipeline. The pipeline carries carbon dioxide from the McElmo Dome and Doe Canyon source fields near Cortez, Colorado to the Denver City, Texas hub. The tariffs charged by Cortez Pipeline are not regulated, but are based on a consent decree.



The Central Basin pipeline consists of approximately 143 miles of mainline pipe and 177 miles of lateral supply lines located in the Permian Basin between Denver City, Texas and McCamey, Texas.  The pipeline has an ultimate throughput capacity of 700 million cubic feet per day.  At its origination point in Denver City, the Central Basin pipeline interconnects with all three major carbon dioxide supply pipelines from Colorado and New Mexico, namely the Cortez pipeline (operated by KMCO2) and the Bravo and Sheep Mountain pipelines (operated by Oxy Permian).  Central Basin’s mainline terminates near McCamey, where it interconnects with the Canyon Reef Carriers pipeline and the Pecos pipeline.  The tariffs charged by
 the Central Basin pipeline are not regulated.



KMP’s Centerline carbon dioxide pipeline consists of approximately 113 miles of pipe located in the Permian Basin between Denver City, Texas and Snyder, Texas.  The pipeline has a capacity of 300 million cubic feet per day.  The tariffs charged by the Centerline pipeline are not regulated.



KMP owns a 13% undivided interest in the 218-mile, Bravo pipeline, which delivers carbon dioxide from the Bravo Dome source field in northeast New Mexico to the Denver City hub and has a capacity of more than 350 million cubic feet per day.  Tariffs on the Bravo pipeline are not regulated.



KMP’s Eastern Shelf carbon dioxide pipeline, which consists of approximately 91 miles of pipe located in the Permian Basin begins near Snyder, Texas and ends west of Knox City, Texas.  The pipeline extends KMCO2’s 1,300 mile carbon dioxide pipeline system into a new area with a current capacity of 65 million standard cubic feet of carbon dioxide per day, expandable to 200 million standard cubic feet per day in the future. The Eastern Shelf Pipeline system is currently flowing 15 million standard cubic feet per day.  The tariffs charged on the Eastern Shelf pipeline are not regulated.



In addition, KMP owns approximately 98% of the Canyon Reef Carriers pipeline and approximately 69% of the Pecos pipeline.  The Canyon Reef Carriers pipeline extends 139 miles from McCamey, Texas, to the SACROC unit.  The pipeline has a capacity of approximately 270 million cubic feet per day and makes deliveries to the SACROC, Sharon Ridge, Cogdell and Reinecke units.  The Pecos pipeline is a 25-mile carbon dioxide pipeline that runs from McCamey to Iraan, Texas.  It has a capacity of approximately 120 million cubic feet per day and makes deliveries to the Yates unit.  The tariffs charged on the Canyon Reef Carriers and Pecos pipelines are not regulated.



Markets.The principal market for transportation on KMP’s carbon dioxide pipelines is to customers, including itself, using carbon dioxide for enhanced recovery operations in mature oil fields in the Permian Basin, where industry demand is expected to remain strong for the next several years.



Competition.KMP’s ownership interests in the Central Basin, Cortez and Bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other carbon dioxide pipelines.  KMP also competes with other interest owners in McElmo Dome, Doe Canyon and





28



Bravo Dome for transportation of carbon dioxide to the Denver City, Texas market area.



Crude Oil Pipeline



KMP’s Kinder Morgan Wink Pipeline is a 450-mile Texas intrastate crude oil pipeline system consisting of three mainline sections, two gathering systems and numerous truck delivery stations.  The pipeline allows KMP to better manage crude oil deliveries from its oil field interests in West Texas, and it has entered into a long-term throughput agreement with Western Refining Company, L.P. to transport crude oil into Western’s 120,000 barrel per day refinery in El Paso. The 20-inch diameter pipeline segment that runs from Wink to El Paso has a total capacity of 130,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and it transported approximately118,100 barrels of oil per day in 2010 and approximately117,0
00 barrels of oil per day in 2009.  The Kinder Morgan Wink Pipeline is regulated by both the FERC and the Texas Railroad Commission.



Terminals—KMP



The Terminals—KMP business segment includes the operations of KMP’s petroleum, chemical and other liquids terminal facilities (other than those included in the Products Pipelines—KMP business segment) and all of its coal, petroleum coke, fertilizer, steel, ores and other dry-bulk material services facilities, including all transload, engineering, conveying and other in-plant services.  Combined, the business segment is composed of approximately124 owned or operated liquids and bulk terminal facilities and approximately 33 rail transloading and materials handling facilities.  The terminals are located throughout the United States, in portions of Canada, and at a single location in the Netherlands.  To help management evalua
te business segment performance, make operating decisions, and allocate resources, KMP groups its terminal operations into thirteen regions based on geographic location and/or primary operating function, and classifies its terminal operations based on their handling of either liquids or bulk material products.



Liquids Terminals



KMP’s liquids terminals operations primarily store refined petroleum products, petrochemicals, industrial chemicals and vegetable oil products in aboveground storage tanks and transfer products to and from pipelines, vessels, tank trucks, tank barges, and tank railcars.  Combined, KMP’s approximately 25 liquids terminals facilities possess liquids storage capacity of approximately 58.2 million barrels, and in 2010 and 2009, these terminals experienced throughput of approximately 620 million barrels and 604 million barrels, respectively, of petroleum, chemicals and vegetable oil products.



KMP’s major liquids terminal assets include the following:



▪the Houston, Texas terminal complex located in Pasadena and Galena Park, Texas, along the Houston Ship Channel.  Recognized as a distribution hub for Houston’s refineries situated on or near the Houston Ship Channel, the Pasadena and Galena Park terminals are the western Gulf Coast refining community’s central interchange point.  The complex has approximately 26.4 million barrels of capacity and is connected via pipeline to 14 refineries, four petrochemical plants and ten major outbound pipelines.  Cross-channel pipelines connect the two facilities, and KMP has an eight-bay, fully automated truck loading rack located at its Pasadena terminal.  At the truck rack, a full range of additive services are provided, including additive systems for biodiesel and ethanol. In addition, the facilities have five ship docks and seven barge docks for inbound and outbound 
movement of products, and the Galena Park terminal is served by the Union Pacific railroad;



▪three liquids facilities in the New York Harbor area: one in Carteret, New Jersey; one in Perth Amboy, New Jersey; and one on Staten Island, New York.  The two New Jersey facilities offer viable alternatives for moving petroleum products between the refineries and terminals throughout the New York Harbor and both are New York Mercantile Exchange delivery points for gasoline and heating oil.  Both facilities are connected to the Intra Harbor Transfer Service, an operation that offers direct outbound pipeline connections that allow product to be moved from over 20 harbor delivery points to destinations north and west of New York City.



The Carteret facility is located along the Arthur Kill River just south of New York City and has a capacity of approximately 7.8 million barrels of petroleum and petrochemical products.  The facility also has pipeline connections to the Buckeye pipeline system, a major products pipeline serving the East Coast.  KMP is currently expanding the facility, adding over one million barrels of new liquids capacity for a large petroleum customer, and it expects this expansion to come on-line in the second and third quarters of 2011.  The Carteret facility has two ship docks and four barge docks.  It is connected to the Colonial, Buckeye, Sun and Harbor pipeline systems, and the CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads service the facility.

The Perth Amboy facility is also located along the Arthur Kill River and has a capacity of approximately 3.5 million barrels of petroleum and petrochemical products.  The Perth Amboy terminal provides chemical and petroleum storage and handling, as well as dry-bulk handling of salt.  In addition to providing product movement via vessel, truck and rail, Perth Amboy has direct access to the Buckeye and Colonial pipelines. The facility has one ship dock and one barge dock, and is connected to the CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads.



The Kinder Morgan Staten Island terminal is located on Staten Island, New York.  The facility is bounded to the north and west by the Arthur Kill River and covers approximately 200 acres, of which 120 acres are used for site operations.  The terminal is connected to the Colonial Pipeline and has a storage capacity of approximately three million barrels for gasoline, diesel fuel and fuel oil.  The facility also maintains and operates an above ground piping network to transfer petroleum products throughout the operating portion of the site, and it has a ship berth that accommodates tanker vessels;



▪two liquids terminal facilities in the Chicago area: one facility located in Argo, Illinois, approximately 14 miles southwest of downtown Chicago and situated along the Chicago sanitary and ship channel; and the other located in the Port of Chicago along the Calumet River.  The Argo facility is a large petroleum product and ethanol blending facility and a major break bulk facility for large chemical manufacturers and distributors.  It has approximately 2.7 million barrels of tankage capacity and three barge docks.  The facility is connected to the Enterprise and Westshore pipelines, and has a direct connection to Midway Airport.  The Canadian National railroad services this facility.



The Port of Chicago facility handles a wide variety of liquid chemicals with a working capacity of approximately 796,000 barrels.  The facility provides access to a full slate of transportation options, including a deep water barge/ship berth on Lake Calumet, and offers services including truck loading and off-loading, iso-container handling and drumming.  There are two ship docks and four barge docks, and the facility is served by the Norfolk Southern railroad;



▪the Port of New Orleans facility located in Harvey, Louisiana.  The New Orleans facility handles a variety of liquids products such as chemicals, vegetable oils, animal fats, alcohols and oil field products, and also provides ancillary services including drumming, packaging, warehousing, and cold storage services.  It has approximately 3.0 million barrels of tankage capacity, three ship docks, and one barge dock.  The Union Pacific railroad provides rail service, and the terminal can be accessed by vessel, barge, tank truck, or rail;



▪the Kinder Morgan North 40 terminal located in Strathcona County, just east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  The North 40 terminal is a crude oil tank farm that serves as a premier blending and storage hub for Canadian crude oil.  The facility has storage for approximately 2.16 million barrels of crude oil and has access to several incoming pipelines and all major outbound systems, including a connection with KMP’s Trans Mountain pipeline system.  The entire capacity of this terminal is contracted under long-term contracts; and



▪KMP’s five ethanol handling facilities, consisting of services offered by its unit train terminaling facilities located at Richmond and Lomita, California; Linden, New Jersey; Baltimore, Maryland; and Euless, Texas.  In March 2010, KMP began operations at its newly-built Richmond terminal, which is serviced by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad.  The Lomita facility is a high-volume rail ethanol terminal located on a seven acre site serviced by the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad.  It offers direct connection to Shell’s Carson, California ethanol terminal, the largest west coast ethanol hub and a major supplier of products to KMP’s West Coast Products pipeline system.



KMP acquired its Linden, Baltimore and Euless facilities in 2010.  For more information on these train terminal facilities and other terminal acquisitions during 2010, see “—(a) General Development of Business—Recent Developments—Terminals—KMP.”



Competition.KMP is one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in North America.  Its primary competitors are IMTT, Magellan, Morgan Stanley, NuStar, Oil Tanking, Enterprise, and Vopak.



Bulk Terminals



KMP’s bulk terminal operations primarily involve dry-bulk material handling services; however, KMP also provides conveyor manufacturing and installation, engineering and design services, and in-plant services covering material handling, conveying, maintenance and repair, truck-railcar-marine transloading, railcar switching and miscellaneous marine services.  KMP owns or operates approximately 99 dry-bulk terminals in the United States, Canada and the





30



Netherlands, and combined, its dry-bulk and material transloading facilities handled approximately 92.4 million tons and 78.0 million tons of coal, petroleum coke, fertilizers, steel, ores and other dry-bulk materials in 2010 and 2009, respectively.



KMP’s major bulk terminal assets include the following:



▪the Vancouver Wharves bulk marine terminal, located at Port Metro Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  KMP owns certain bulk terminal buildings and equipment, and it operates the terminal under a 40-year lease agreement.  The facility consists of five vessel berths situated on a 139-acre site, extensive rail infrastructure, dry-bulk and liquid storage, and material handling systems, rail track and transloading systems, and five shiploaders.  The terminal can handle over 3.5 million tons of cargo annually.  In 2010, KMP completed a long-term terminal expansion that (i) brought on-line and refurbished additional liquids and biodiesel storage tanks that increased terminal liquids throughput capacity; (ii) installed a new shiploader; (iii) improved marine structures and material handling systems to both increase mineral concentrates operations and significantly improve en
vironmental performance and (iv) added a rail receiving and storage facility to handle ferrous granule (slag).  Vancouver Wharves has access to three major rail carriers connecting to shippers in western and central Canada and the U.S. Pacific Northwest.  Vancouver Wharves offers a variety of inbound, outbound and value-added services for mineral concentrates, wood products, agri-products, refined petroleum products and sulfur;



▪the petroleum coke or coal terminals that KMP operates or owns.  KMP is the largest independent handler of petroleum coke in the U.S., in terms of volume, and in 2010, it handled approximately 12.6 million tons of petroleum coke, as compared to approximately 12.9 million tons in 2009.  Petroleum coke is a by-product of the crude oil refining process and has characteristics similar to coal.  It is used as a source of fuel in both industrial kilns and in utilities and industrial steam generation facilities, and is used by the steel and aluminum industries in manufacturing processes.  A portion of the petroleum coke that is handled is imported from or exported to foreign markets.  Most of KMP’s customers are large integrated oil companies that choose to outsource the storage and loading of petroleum coke for a fee.  Most of KMP’s petroleum 
coke assets are located in the state of Texas, and include facilities at the Port of Houston and various refineries.  These facilities may also provide handling and storage services for a variety of other bulk materials.



In 2010, KMP handled approximately 31.6 million tons of coal, as compared to approximately 27.8 million tons of coal handled in 2009.  Coal continues to be the fuel of choice for electric generation plants, accounting for more than 50% of U.S. electric generation feedstock.  Current domestic supplies are predicted to last for several hundred years and most coal transloaded through KMP’s coal terminals is destined for use in coal-fired electric generation facilities.



The Cora coal terminal is a high-speed, rail-to-barge coal transfer and storage facility located on approximately 480 acres of land along the upper Mississippi River near Rockwood, Illinois.  The terminal sits on the mainline of the Union Pacific Railroad and is strategically positioned to receive coal shipments from the western United States.  The majority of the coal arrives at the terminal by rail from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, and the coal is then transferred out on barges to power plants along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, although small quantities are shipped overseas.  The Cora terminal can receive and dump coal from trains and can load barges at the same time. It has ground capacity to store a total of 1.25 million tons of coal, and maximum throughput at the terminal is approximately 13 million tons annually.  This coal storage and transfer capacity
 provides customers the flexibility to coordinate their supplies of coal with the demand at power plants.



The Grand Rivers, Kentucky terminal is a coal transloading and storage facility located along the Tennessee River just above the Kentucky Dam.  The terminal is operated on land under easements with an initial expiration of July 2014 and has current annual throughput capacity of approximately 12 million tons with a storage capacity of approximately one million tons.  KMP’s Grand Rivers Terminal provides easy access to the Ohio-Mississippi River network and the Tennessee-Tombigbee River system.  The Paducah & Louisville Railroad, a short line railroad, serves Grand Rivers with connections to seven Class I rail lines including the Union Pacific, CSX, and Burlington Northern Santa Fe.



The Pier IX terminal located on a 42-acre storage site in Newport News, Virginia.  The terminal has the capacity to transload approximately 12 million tons of bulk products per year.  The terminal can store approximately one million tons of coal, and offers coal blending services and rail to storage or direct transfer to ship.  For other dry bulk products, the terminal offers ship to storage to rail or truck.  KMP’s Pier IX terminal exports coal to foreign markets, serves power plants on the eastern seaboard of the United States, and imports cement pursuant to a long-term contract.  The Pier IX terminal is served by the CSX Railroad, which transports coal from central





31



Appalachian and other eastern coal basins.  Cement imported to the Pier IX terminal primarily originates in Europe; and



▪KMP’s approximately 47 steel and ores/metals terminals located at strategic locations throughout the United States, which transload and handle steel, ferro chrome, ferro manganese, ferro silicon, silicon metal, scrap, plate, coils, bars, slabs, rail, tubes, pipe and rebar.  KMP’s value-added services include canning, drumming, bagging and filling boxes and supersacks.  KMP’s handling methods include, but are not limited to, the loading and unloading of barges, ships, rail cars and trucks, and inside and outside storage.  Combined, these facilities handled approximately 24.7 million tons and 16.7 million tons of steel and steel-related products in 2010 and 2009, respectively.  The 48% increase in year-to-year steel volumes in 2010 versus 2009 was primarily due to the difficult economic environment during 2009.  While the operating results of 
KMP’s metal handling terminals are affected by a number of business-specific factors, the primary drivers for its ores/metal volumes are general economic conditions in North America, Europe and China, and the levels of worldwide steel production and consumption.



Competition.KMP’s bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators, other terminals owned by oil companies, stevedoring companies, and other industrials opting not to outsource terminal services.  Many of KMP’s bulk terminals were constructed pursuant to long-term contracts for specific customers.  As a result, KMP believes other terminal operators would face a significant disadvantage in competing for this business.



Materials Services (rail transloading)



KMP’s materials services operations include rail or truck transloading operations conducted at 33 owned and non-owned facilities.  The Burlington Northern Santa Fe, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, Kansas City Southern and A&W railroads provide rail service for these terminal facilities.  Approximately 50% of the products handled are liquids, including an entire spectrum of liquid chemicals, and 50% are dry-bulk products.  Many of the facilities are equipped for bi-modal operation (rail-to-truck, and truck-to-rail) or connect via pipeline to storage facilities.  Several facilities provide railcar storage services.  KMP also designs and builds transloading facilities, performs inventory management services, and provides value-added services such as blending, heating a
nd sparging.  In 2010 and 2009, KMP’s terminals business segment, including all bulk, liquids and materials services operations, handled approximately 229,000 and 227,000 railcars, respectively.



Competition.KMP’s material services operations compete with a variety of national transload and terminal operators across the United States, including Savage Services, Watco and Bulk Plus Logistics.  Additionally, single or multi-site terminal operators are often entrenched in the network of Class 1 rail carriers.



Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP



The Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP business segment includes the Trans Mountain pipeline system, KMP’s ownership of a one-third interest in the Express pipeline system, and the 25-mile Jet Fuel pipeline system.  The weighted average remaining life of the shipping contracts on these pipelines was approximately four years as of December 31, 2010.



Trans Mountain Pipeline System



The Trans Mountain common carrier pipeline system originates at Edmonton, Alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of British Columbia.  KMP owns a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of Washington.  Trans Mountain’s pipeline is 715 miles in length. The capacity of the line at Edmonton ranges from 300,000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents 20% of the total throughput (which is a historically normal heavy crude percentage), to 400,000 barrels per day with no heavy crude.  Trans Mountain is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from Alberta to the west coast.  KMP believes these facilities provide it the opportunity to consider capacity ex
pansions to the west coast, either in stages or as one project, as the market for offshore exports continues to develop.



In 2010, deliveries on Trans Mountain averaged 297,000 barrels per day.  This was an increase of 6% from average 2009 deliveries of 280,507 barrels per day.  The crude oil and refined petroleum products transported through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system originates in Alberta and British Columbia. The refined and partially refined petroleum products transported to Kamloops, British Columbia and Vancouver originates from oil refineries located in Edmonton.  Products delivered through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system are used in markets in British Columbia, Washington State and elsewhere off shore.





32



In the fourth quarter of 2010, Trans Mountain completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement effective for the period beginning January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2015.  Trans Mountain filed the settlement with the National Energy Board of Canada in November 2010 and anticipates approval in the first half of 2011.



Express and Jet Fuel Pipeline Systems



KMP owns a one-third ownership interest in the Express pipeline system, and a subordinated debenture issued by Express US Holdings LP, the partnership that maintains ownership of the U.S. portion of the Express pipeline system.  Through its Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP business segment, KMP operates the Express pipeline system and accounts for its one-third investment under the equity method of accounting.  The Express pipeline system is a batch-mode, common-carrier, crude oil pipeline system comprised of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline, collectively referred to in this report as the Express pipeline system.  The approximate 1,700-mile integrated oil transportation pipeline connects Canadian and United States producers to refineries located in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions
.



The Express Pipeline is a 780-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline that begins at the crude oil pipeline hub at Hardisty, Alberta and terminates at the Casper, Wyoming facilities of the Platte Pipeline.  The Express Pipeline has a design capacity of 280,000 barrels per day.  Receipts at Hardisty averaged 200,000 barrels per day in 2010, as compared to 208,246 barrels per day in 2009.



The Platte Pipeline is a 926-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline that runs from the crude oil pipeline hub at Casper, Wyoming to refineries and interconnecting pipelines in the Wood River, Illinois area.  The Platte Pipeline has a current capacity of approximately 150,000 barrels per day downstream of Casper, Wyoming and approximately 140,000 barrels per day downstream of Guernsey, Wyoming.  Platte deliveries averaged 142,400 barrels per day during 2010, as compared to 137,810 barrels per day during 2009.



KMP also owns and operates the approximate 25-mile aviation turbine fuel pipeline that serves the Vancouver International Airport, located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the Jet Fuel pipeline system.  In addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the Westridge Marine terminal, located in Port Metro Vancouver, the Jet Fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the Vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15,000 barrels.



Competition.  Trans Mountain and the Express pipeline system are each one of several pipeline alternatives for western Canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production, and each competes against other pipeline providers.



NGPL PipeCo LLC



In February 2008, we completed the sale of an 80% ownership interest in NGPL PipeCo LLC for approximately $5.9 billion. We account for our 20% ownership interest as an equity method investment. We continue to operate NGPL PipeCo LLC’s assets pursuant to a 15-year operating agreement. NGPL PipeCo LLC owns and operates approximately 9,200 miles of interstate natural gas pipelines, storage fields, field system lines and related facilities, consisting primarily of two major interconnected natural gas transmission pipelines terminating in the Chicago, Illinois metropolitan area. NGPL’s Amarillo Line originates in the West Texas and New Mexico producing areas and is comprised of approximately 4,400 miles of mainline and various small-diameter pipelines. Its other major pipeline, the Gulf Coast Line, originates in the Gulf Co
ast areas of Texas and Louisiana and consists of approximately 4,100 miles of mainline and various small-diameter pipelines. These two main pipelines are connected at points in Texas and Oklahoma by NGPL’s approximately 800-mile Amarillo/Gulf Coast pipeline.



NGPL is one of the nation’s largest natural gas storage operators with approximately 600 billion cubic feet of total natural gas storage capacity, approximately 278 billion cubic feet of working gas capacity and over 4.3 billion cubic feet per day of peak deliverability from its storage facilities, which are located in major supply areas and near the markets it serves. NGPL owns and operates 13 underground storage reservoirs in eight field locations in four states. These storage assets complement its pipeline facilities and allow it to optimize pipeline deliveries and meet peak delivery requirements in its principal markets.



Competition.NGPL competes with other transporters of natural gas in virtually all of the markets it serves and, in particular, in the Chicago area, which is the northern terminus of NGPL’s two major pipeline segments and its largest market. These competitors include both interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines and, historically, most of the competition has been from such pipelines with supplies originating in the United States. NGPL also faces competition from Alliance Pipeline, which began service during the 2000-2001 heating season carrying Canadian-produced natural





33



gas into the Chicago market. However, at the same time, the Vector Pipeline was constructed for the specific purpose of transporting gas from the Chicago area to other markets, generally further north and further east. The overall impact of the increased pipeline capacity into the Chicago area, combined with additional take-away capacity and the increased demand in the area, has created a situation that remains dynamic with respect to the ultimate impact on individual transporters such as NGPL. From time to time, other pipelines are proposed which would compete with NGPL. We cannot predict whether or when any such pipeline might be built, or its impact on NGPL’s operations or profitability.



Major Customers



Our total revenues are derived from a wide customer base.For each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues.  KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of Texas, and, to a far lesser extent, the CO2—KMP business segment also sells natural gas.  Combined, total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP and CO2—KMP and NGPL (thr
ough February 14, 2008) business segments in 2010, 2009 and 2008 accounted for 44.1%, 44.8% and 63.7%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues.  To the extent possible, KMP attempts to balance the pricing and timing of its natural gas purchases to its natural gas sales, and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales.  We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Regulation



Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations



Some of our U.S. refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA.  The ICA requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the FERC.  Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services.  The ICA requires, among other things, that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate s
uch rates.  If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation.  The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively.  Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint.



On October 24, 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  The Energy Policy Act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ICA.  The Energy Policy Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates. Certain rates on KMP’s Pacific operations pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365-day period established by the Energy Policy Act.  Accordingly, certain of the Pacific pipelines’ rates have been, and continue to be, the subje
ct of complaints with the FERC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



Petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index.  Shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year.  A pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates.  Cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates.



Common Carrier Pipeline Rate Regulation – Canadian Operations



The Canadian portion of KMP’s crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of Canada’s National Energy Board, referred to in this report as NEB.  The National Energy Board Act gives the NEB power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service.





34



Trans Mountain Pipeline.KMP’s subsidiary, Trans Mountain Pipeline, L.P., previously had a toll settlement with shippers that defined tolls from 2006 to 2010.  The settlement expired on December 31, 2010.  In the fourth quarter of 2010, Trans Mountain Pipeline completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement for KMP’s Trans Mountain Pipeline to be effective for the period starting January 1, 2011 and ending December 31, 2015.  Trans Mountain filed the settlement with the NEB in November 2010, and anticipates approval from the NEB in the first half of 2011.  The toll charged for the portion of Trans Mountain’s pipeline system located in the Unit
ed States falls under the jurisdiction of the FERC.  See “—Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations.”



Express Pipeline.The Canadian segment of the Express Pipeline is regulated by the NEB as a Group 2 pipeline, which results in rates and terms of service being regulated on a complaint basis only.  Express committed contract rates are subject to a 2% inflation adjustment April 1 of each year.  The U.S. segment of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline are regulated by the FERC.  See “—Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations.”  Additionally, movements on the Platte Pipeline within the state of Wyoming are regulated by the Wyoming Public Service Commission, which regulates the tariffs and terms of service of public utilities that oper
ate in the state of Wyoming.  The Wyoming Public Service Commission standards applicable to rates are similar to those of the FERC and the NEB.



Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Regulation



Posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines.  Within that range, each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition, so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination.  Apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums, the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty, irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariff-based maximum and minimum rate levels.  Accordingly, there are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay.  For example, some shippers may pay a negotiated rate that is different than the posted tari
ff rate, and some may pay the posted maximum tariff rate or a discounted rate that is limited by the posted maximum and minimum tariff rates.  Most of the rates, KMP charges shippers on its greenfield projects, like the Rockies Express or Midcontinent Express pipelines, are pursuant to negotiated rate long-term transportation agreements.  As such, negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates.  While rates may vary by shipper and circumstance, the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable.



The FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions of service, construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services, including storage services, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.  To a lesser extent, the FERC regulates interstate transportation rates, terms and conditions of service under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.



On November 25, 2003, the FERC issued Order No. 2004, adopting revised standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities.  In light of the changing structure of the energy industry, these standards of conduct governed relationships between regulated interstate natural gas pipelines and all of their energy affiliates.  These standards were designed to:



▪extend standards of conduct regulations to cover an interstate natural gas pipeline’s relationship with energy affiliates that are not marketers;



▪prevent interstate natural gas pipelines from giving an undue preference to any of their energy affiliates; and



▪ensure that transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis.



On October 16, 2008, the FERC issued a Final Rule in Order No. 717, which revised the FERC standards of conduct for natural gas and electric transmission providers by eliminating Order No. 2004’s concept of energy affiliates and corporate separation in favor of an employee functional approach.  According to the provisions of Order No. 717, a natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee non-public information about the transmission system or a transmission customer.  The final rule also retains the long-standing no-conduit rule, which prohibits a transmission function provider from disclosing non-public information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit.  Additionally, the final rule requires that a transmission provider 
provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees, marketing function employees, officers, directors, supervisory employees, and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information.





35



This rule became effective November 26, 2008.



On October 15, 2009, the FERC issued Order No. 717-A, an order on rehearing and clarification regarding FERC’s Affiliate Rule—Standards of Conduct, and on November 16, 2009, the FERC issued Order No. 717-B, an order clarifying what employees should be considered marketing function employees.  In both orders, the FERC clarified a lengthy list of issues relating to: the applicability, the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees, the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees, the definition of transmission function information, independent functioning, transparency, training, and North American Energy Standards Board business practice standards.  The FERC generally reaffirmed its determinations in Order No. 717, but granted rehearing on and clarif
ied provisions.  Order Nos. 717-A and 717-B aim to make the standards of conduct clearer and aim to refocus the rules on the areas where there is the greatest potential for abuse.  The rehearing and clarification granted in Order No. 717-A are not anticipated to have a material impact on the operation of our interstate pipelines.



In addition to regulatory changes initiated by the FERC, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act amended the Natural Gas Act to: (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder.



California Public Utilities Commission Rate Regulation



The intrastate common carrier operations of KMP’s Pacific operations pipelines in California are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission, referred to in this report as CPUC, under a “depreciated book plant” methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment.  Intrastate tariffs filed by KMP with the CPUC have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the California intrastate portion of the Pacific operations’ business.  Tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in California are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the CPUC.  A variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the CPUC, and certain other 
issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to KMP’s FERC regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates.  Certain of the Pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been, and continue to be, subject to complaints with the CPUC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



Texas Railroad Commission Rate Regulation



The intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in Texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the Texas Railroad Commission.  The Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.



Safety Regulation



Our interstate pipelines are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation, referred to in this report as the U.S. DOT, and our intrastate pipelines and other operations are subject to comparable state regulations with respect to their design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management.  Comparable regulation exists in some states in which we conduct pipeline operations.  In addition, our truck and terminal loading facilities are subject to U.S. DOT regulations dealing with the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicles and railcars.



On September 15, 2010, the secretary of the U.S. DOT sent to the U.S. Congress proposed legislation to provide stronger oversight of the nation’s pipelines and to increase the penalties for violations of pipeline safety rules.  The proposed legislation entitled “Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2010,” would, among other things, increase the maximum fine for the most serious violations from $1 million to $2.5 million, provide additional resources for the enforcement program, require a review of whether safety requirements for “high consequence areas” should be applied instead to entire pipelines, eliminate exemptions and ensure standards are in place for bio-fuel and carbon dioxide pipelines.



The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 provides guidelines in the areas of testing, education, training and communication.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as “high consequence areas.”  Testing consists of hydrostatic testing, internal magnetic flux or ultrasonic testing, or direct assessment of the piping.  In





36



addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained.  A similar integrity management rule exists for refined petroleum products pipelines.



We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and other comparable federal and state statutes that address employee health and safety.



In general, we expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards.  Such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be accurately estimated at this time.



State and Local Regulation



Our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.



Environmental Matters



Our business operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, pollution and human health and safety in the United States and Canada.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, or at or from our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures.  Furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental ana
lysis under federal and state laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required under federal, state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.



Environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change.  The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment, wildlife, natural resources and human health.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.





Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste



We generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state and Canadian statutes.  From time to time, the U.S. EPA and state and Canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous waste.  Furthermore, it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated





37



during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations, may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes.”  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes.  Such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.



Superfund



The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as “CERCLA” or the “Superfund” law, and analogous state and Canadian laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of “potentially responsible persons” for releases of “hazardous substances” into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  CERCLA authorizes the U.S. EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, in addi
tion to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Although “petroleum” is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a “hazardous substance,” in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of “hazardous substance.”  By operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.



Clean Air Act



Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state and Canadian statutes and regulations.  We believe that the operations of our pipelines, storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes.  The U.S. EPA has recently adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act that are to take effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.  The Clean Air Act regulations contain lengthy, complex provisions that may result in the imposition over the next several years of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of our pipelines, treating and processing facilities, storage facilities, termi
nals and wells.  Depending on the nature of those requirements and any additional requirements that may be imposed by state, local and Canadian regulatory authorities, we may be required to incur capital and operating expenditures over the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals and addressing other air emission-related issues.  At this time, we are unable to fully estimate the effect on earnings or operations or the amount and timing of such required capital expenditures; however, we do not believe that we will be materially adversely affected by any such requirements.



Clean Water Act



Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state and Canadian laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal, state or Canadian authorities.  The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills.  Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state and Canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent
 contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release.



Climate Change



Studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases,” may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases.  The U.S. Congress is actively considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  On June 26, 2009, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, referred to in this report as ACESA, which would establish an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce U.S. emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane.  The U.S. Senate has been working on its own legislation for
 restricting domestic greenhouse gas emissions, and President Obama has indicated his support of legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an emission allowance system.  It is not possible at this time to predict when the Senate may act on climate change legislation or how any bill passed by the Senate would be reconciled with ACESA.





38



The U.S. EPA announced on December 7, 2009, its finding that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to human health and the environment.  This finding by the U.S. EPA allowed the agency to adopt regulations that began restricting emissions of greenhouse gases from certain stationary sources using existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act on January 2, 2011.  Additionally, the U.S. EPA has issued a final rule requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States beginning in 2011 for emissions that occurred in 2010 from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources, fractionated natural gas liquids, and the production of naturally occurring carbon dioxide, like KMP’s McElmo Dome carbon dioxide field, even when s
uch production is not emitted to the atmosphere.



Because KMP’s operations, including the compressor stations and gas processing plants in the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP business segment, emit various types of greenhouse gases, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, such legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities and require us to install new emission controls on the facilities, acquire allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.  KMP is not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, they could be significant.  While KMP may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by its natural gas pipelines, such recovery of costs is uncertai
n in all cases and may depend on events beyond its control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.



Because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, energy legislation or U.S. EPA regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil.  In addition, we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within the CO2—KMP business segment.  However, these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.  Although the magnitude and direction of th
ese impacts cannot now be predicted, greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.



Some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding.  We may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  To the extent these phenomena occur, they could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone regions.  However, the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and, in any event, these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon.  Thus, we are not in a position to say 
whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business, financial position, results of operations or prospects.



Department of Homeland Security



In Section 550 of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007, the U.S. Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security, referred to in this report as the DHS, regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical facilities.  Pursuant to its congressional mandate, on April 9, 2007, the DHS promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards.  This process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet DHS-defined risk-based performance standards.  The DHS has not provided final notice to all facilities that DHS determines to 
be high risk and subject to the rule.  Therefore, neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.



Other



Employees



We employed 8,142 full-time people at December 31, 2010, including employees of our indirect subsidiary KMGP Services Company, Inc., who are dedicated to the operations of KMP, and employees of Kinder Morgan Canada Inc. Approximately 925 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2011 and 2015.  We, KMGP Services Company, Inc., and Kinder Morgan Canada Inc. each consider relations with our employees to be good. For more information on our related party transactions, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.





39





Our named executive officers and other employees that provide management or services to us and the Group are employed by us. Additionally, other of our employees assist KMP in the operation of its Natural Gas Pipeline assets. These employees’ expenses are allocated without a profit component between us and the appropriate members of the Group.
