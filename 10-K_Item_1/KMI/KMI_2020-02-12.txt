Financings



During 2019, we repaid approximately $2.8 billion of maturing debt with cash proceeds received from the sales of TMPL and the U.S. portion of the Cochin Pipeline.  After-tax proceeds received in January 2020 from the sale of Pembina stock received from the sale of KML will be used to pay down debt in early 2020.












2020 Outlook



We expect to declare dividends of $1.25 per share for 2020, a 25% increase from the 2019 declared dividends of $1.00 per share, generate approximately $5.1 billion of DCF, or $2.24 of DCF per share, and $7.6 billion of Adjusted EBITDA.  We also expect to invest $2.4 billion in expansion projects and contributions to joint ventures during 2020.  Our discretionary spending will be primarily funded with excess, internally generated cash flow, with no need to access equity markets during 2020.  We expect that our Net Debt-to-Adjusted EBITDA  ratio for 2020 year-end will be 4.3 times.  See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

We do not provide budgeted net income attributable to common stockholders or budgeted net income, the GAAP financial measures most directly comparable to the non-GAAP financial measures of DCF and Adjusted EBITDA, respectively, due to the impracticality of quantifying certain components required by GAAP such as: unrealized gains and losses on derivatives marked to market and potential changes in estimates for certain contingent liabilities.

Our expectations for 2020 assume average annual prices for WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas of $55.00 per barrel and $2.50 per MMBtu, respectively, consistent with the forward pricing during our 2020 budget process.  The vast majority of revenue we generate is supported by multi-year fee-based customer arrangements and therefore is not directly exposed to commodity prices.  The primary area where we have direct commodity price sensitivity is in our CO2segment, in which we hedge the majority of the next 12 months of oil and NGL production to minimize this sensitivity.  For2020, we estimate that every $1 change in the average WTI crude oil price per barrel would impact our DCF by approximately $5 million, each $0.10 per MMBtu change in the average price of natural gas would impact DCF by approximately $1 million, and each 1% change in the ratio of the weighted average NGL price per barrel to the average WTI crude oil price per barrel would impact DCF by approximately $2 million.



In addition, our expectations for 2020 discussed above involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance.  Many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict, and because of these uncertainties, it is advisable not to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.  Please read our Item 1A “Risk Factors” below and “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” at the beginning of this report for more information.  Furthermore, we plan to provide updates to our 2020 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis.

Narrative Description of Business





Business Strategy



Our business strategy is to:



•focus on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure of growing markets within North America;

•increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and employing environmentally sound operating practices;

•exercise discipline in capital allocation and in evaluating expansion projects and acquisition opportunities;

•leverage economies of scale from expansions of assets and acquisitions that fit within our strategy; and

•maintain a strong financial profile and enhance and return value to our stockholders.



It is our intention to carry out the above business strategy, modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances.  However, as discussed under Item 1A.“Risk Factors”below and at the beginning of this report in “Information Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,” there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out.



We regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions, and full and partial divestitures, and we are currently contemplating potential transactions.  Any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable








terms and conditions, and, as applicable, receipt of fairness opinions, and approval of our board of directors.  While there are currently no unannounced purchase or sale agreements for the acquisition or sale of any material business or assets, such transactions can be effected quickly, may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations.

Competition



The market for natural gas infrastructure is highly competitive, and new pipelines, storage facilities, treating facilities, and facilities for related services are currently being built to serve demand for natural gas in the markets served by the pipelines in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  We compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services.  We believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility, availability of alternative forms of energy and reliability of service.  From time to time, projects are proposed that compete with our existing assets.  Whether or when any such projects would be built, or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability is typically not known.



Shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including renewables such as wind and solar, oil, coal and nuclear.  Several factors influence the demand for natural gas, including price changes, the availability of supply, other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather.












Products Pipelines



Our Products Pipelines business segment consists of our refined petroleum products, crude oil and condensate pipelines, and associated terminals, Southeast terminals, our condensate processing facility and our transmix processing facilities.  The following summarizes the significant Products Pipelines business segment assets that we own and operate as ofDecember 31, 2019:

_______

(a)The terminals provide services including short-term product storage, truck loading, vapor handling, additive injection, dye injection and ethanol blending.

(b)Collectively referred to as Bakken Crude assets.



Competition



Our Products Pipelines’ pipeline and terminal operations compete against proprietary pipelines and terminals owned and operated by major oil companies, other independent products pipelines and terminals, trucking and marine transportation firms (for short-haul movements of products).  Our railcars and our transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities.





Terminals



Our Terminals business segment includes the operations of our refined petroleum product, chemical, ethanol and other liquid terminal facilities (other than those included in the Products Pipelines business segment) and all of our petroleum coke, metal and ores facilities.  Our terminals are located throughout the U.S., primarily near large urban centers.  We believe the location of our facilities and our ability to provide flexibility to customers help attract new and retain existing customers at our terminals and provide expansion opportunities.  We often classify our terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or dry-bulk material products.  In addition, our Terminals’ marine operations include Jones Act-qualified product








tankers that provide marine transportation of crude oil, condensate and refined petroleum products between U.S. ports. The following summarizes our Terminals business segment assets, as ofDecember 31, 2019:



NumberCapacity(MMBbl)Liquids terminals5079.5Bulk terminals32—Jones Act-qualified tankers165.3



Competition



We are one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in North America, based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity.  Our liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals, and terminals owned by oil, chemical, pipeline, and refining companies.  Our bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators, terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities, stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminaling services.  In some locations, competitors are smaller, independent operators with lower cost structures.  Our Jones Act-qualified product tankers compete with other Jones Act-qualified vessel fleets.





CO2



Our CO2business segment produces, transports, and markets CO2for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields.  Our CO2pipelines and related assets allow us to market a complete package of CO2supply and transportation services to our customers.  We also hold ownership interests in several oil-producing fields and own a crude oil pipeline, all located in the Permian Basin region of West Texas.

(a)This is a working interest, in addition, we have a 28% net profits interest.



Competition



Our primary competitors for the sale of CO2include suppliers that have an ownership interest in McElmo Dome, Bravo Dome and Sheep Mountain CO2resources.  Our ownership interests in the Central Basin, Cortez and Bravo pipelines are in direct competition with other CO2pipelines.  We also compete with other interest owners in the McElmo Dome unit and the Bravo Dome unit for transportation of CO2to the Denver City, Texas market area.





Major Customers



Our revenue is derived from a wide customer base.For each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.





Regulation



Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Regulation



As an owner and operator of natural gas companies subject to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, we are required to provide service to shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities at regulated rates that have been determined by the FERC to be just and reasonable.  Recourse rates and general terms and conditions for service are set forth in posted tariffs approved by the FERC for each pipeline (including storage facilities or companies as used herein).  Generally, recourse rates are based on our cost of service, including recovery of, and a return on, our investment.  Posted tariff rates are deemed just and reasonable and cannot be changed without FERC authorization following an evidentiary hearing or settlement.  The FERC can initiate proceedings, on its own initiative or in response to a shipper complaint, that could result in a rate change or confirm existing rates.



Posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines.  Within that range, each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates, so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination.  Apart from discounted rates, upon mutual agreement, the pipeline is permitted to charge negotiated rates that are not bound by and are irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariff-based maximum and minimum rate levels.  Negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of agreed-upon rates during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates.  The actual negotiated rate agreement or a summary of such agreement must be posted as part of the pipelines’ tariffs.  While pipelines and their shippers may agree to a variety of negotiated rate structures depending on the shipper and circumstance, pipelines generally must use for all shippers the form of service agreement that is contained within their FERC-approved tariff.  Any deviation from thepro formaservice agreements must be filed with the FERC and only certain types of deviations in the terms and conditions of service are acceptable to the FERC.



The FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions of service, construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services, including storage services, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.  To a lesser extent, the FERC regulates interstate transportation rates, terms and conditions of service under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  Beginning in the mid-1980s, the FERC adopted a number of regulatory changes to ensure that interstate natural gas pipelines operated on a not unduly discriminatory basis and to create a more competitive and transparent environment in the natural gas marketplace.  Examples include FERC regulations requiring interstate natural gas pipelines to separate their








traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas customers.  Also, natural gas pipelines must separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide (i.e., for transportation services and storage services for natural gas).  To ensure a competitive transportation market, these pipelines must adhere to certain scheduling procedures, accept capacity segmentation in certain circumstances and abide by FERC-established standards of conduct when communicating with marketing affiliates.



In addition to regulatory changes initiated by the FERC, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act amended the Natural Gas Act to: (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder.



Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation



Some of our U.S. refined petroleum products and crude oil gathering and transmission pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA.  The ICA requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the FERC.  Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing gathering or transportation services on our interstate common liquids carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services.  The ICA requires, among other things, that such rates on interstate common liquids carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates.  If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation.  The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively.  Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint.



The Energy Policy Act of 1992 deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ICA.  The Energy Policy Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates.  Certain rates on our SFPP operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365-day period established by the Energy Policy Act.  Accordingly, certain of the SFPP pipelines’ rates have been, and continue to be, the subject of complaints with the FERC, as is more fully described inNote 18“Litigation and Environmental” to our consolidated financial statements.



Petroleum products and crude oil pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index.  Shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year.  A petroleum products or crude oil pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates.  Cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates.



CPUC Rate Regulation



The intrastate common carrier operations of our West Coast Refined Products operations’ pipelines in California are subject to regulation by the CPUC under a “depreciated book plant” methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment.  Intrastate tariffs filed by us with the CPUC have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the California intrastate portion of the West Coast Refined Products operations’ business.  Tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in California are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the CPUC.  A variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the CPUC, and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to our FERC regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates. The intrastate rates for movements in California on our SFPP and Calnev systems have been, and may in the future be, subject to complaints before the CPUC.



Railroad Commission of Texas (RCT) Rate Regulation



The intrastate operations of our crude oil and liquids pipelines and natural gas pipelines and storage facilities in Texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the RCT.  The RCT has the authority to regulate our rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.










Mexico - Energy Regulatory Commission



The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the Energy Regulatory Commission of Mexico (the Commission) that defines the conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service.  This permit expires in 2026.



This permit establishes certain restrictive conditions, including without limitation: (i) compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service; (ii) compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official standards of Mexico regarding safety; (iii) compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the natural gas transportation system authorized by the Commission; (iv) compliance with certain technical studies established by the Commission; and (v) compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10% of the investment proposed in the project.



Mexico - National Agency for Industrial Safety and Environmental Protection (ASEA)



ASEA regulates environmental compliance and industrial and operational safety.  The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline must satisfy and maintain ASEA’s requirements, including compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official standards of Mexico regarding safety, including a Safety Administration Program.



Safety Regulation



We are also subject to safety regulations issued by PHMSA, including those requiring us to develop and maintain pipeline integrity management programs to evaluate areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as High Consequence Areas, or HCAs, and Moderate Consequence Areas, or MCAs, where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.



During September 2019, PHMSA finalized rules to be effective July 1, 2020 to expand integrity management program requirements to hazardous liquids pipelines outside of HCAs (with some exceptions) and  to make certain other changes to those program requirements, including data integration and  emphasis on the use of in-line inspection technology.  During October 2019, PHMSA finalized rules to require operators of natural gas pipelines to (i) expand integrity management program requirements outside of HCAs (with some exceptions), and (ii) reconfirm maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP) on certain pipelines in populated areas including HCAs.  The MAOP reconfirmations must be completed by 2035.  Changes in technology such as advances of in-line inspection tools, identification of additional integrity threats and changes to PHMSA regulations can have a significant impact on costs to perform integrity testing and repairs. We will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by PHMSA regulations. The costs to comply with integrity management program requirements are difficult to predict.  Tests performed as part of our program could result in significant capital and operating expenditures for upgrades and/or repairs deemed necessary to continue the safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.  We expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with these PHMSA regulations.



The Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 or “PIPES Act of 2016” requires PHMSA, among other regulators, to set minimum safety standards for underground natural gas storage facilities and allows states to set more stringent standards for intrastate pipelines. In compliance with the PIPES Act of 2016, we have implemented procedures for underground natural gas storage facilities.












From time to time, our pipelines or facilities may experience leaks and ruptures. These leaks and ruptures may cause explosions, fire, damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death. In connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties.



We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and other federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety.  In general, we believe current expenditures are fulfilling the OSHA requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees.  Based on new regulatory developments, we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards.  However, such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be estimated at this time.



State and Local Regulation



Certain of our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.



Marine Operations



The operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property, personnel and cargo under General Maritime Law. These obligations create a variety of risks including, among other things, the risk of collision, which may result in claims for personal injury, cargo, contract, pollution, third-party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities.



We are subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation (between U.S. departure and destination points) to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and crewed by U.S. citizens. As a result, we monitor the foreign ownership of our common stock and under certain circumstances consistent with our certificate of incorporation, we have the right to redeem shares of our common stock owned by non-U.S. citizens. If we do not comply with such requirements, we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances we would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for our vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels. Furthermore, from time to time, legislation has been introduced unsuccessfully in the U.S. Congress to amend the Jones Act to ease or remove the requirement that vessels operating between U.S. ports be built and registered in the U.S. and owned and crewed by U.S. citizens.  If the Jones Act were amended in such fashion, we could face competition from foreign-flagged vessels.



In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for U.S.-flag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience. The Jones Act and General Maritime Law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness.



The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a federal law that provides the U.S. Secretary of Transportation, upon proclamation by the U.S. President of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by U.S. citizens (including us, provided that we are considered a U.S. citizen for this purpose). If one of our vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the U.S. government under this law, we would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, we would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition.



Canadian Regulation



The Utopia Pipeline System, owned by a joint venture that we operate and in which we own a 50% interest, originates in Ohio and terminates in Windsor, Ontario, Canada and is therefore subject to U.S. regulation as described in this section and below under the heading “—Environmental Matters,” as well as similar regulations promulgated by Canadian authorities with respect to natural gas liquids pipelines.












Environmental Matters



Our business operations are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and human health and safety.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, or at or from our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures.  Furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws, including the Clean Water Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required under federal and state environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.



Environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change.  The long term trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment, wildlife, natural resources and human health.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



In accordance with GAAP, we record liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.  This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed.  We have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multi-party sites where the EPA, or similar state or Canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties.  The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multi-party sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures.



We believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.  We have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of$259 millionas ofDecember 31, 2019.  Our aggregate reserve estimate ranges in value from approximately$259 millionto approximately $428 million, and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range, as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability.  For additional information related to environmental matters, seeNote 18“Litigation and Environmental” to our consolidated financial statements.



Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste



We generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state statutes.  From time to time, the EPA, as well as other U.S. federal and state regulators, consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste.  Furthermore, it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations or wastes from oil and gas facilities that are currently exempt as exploration and production waste, may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes.  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes.  Such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.



Superfund



The CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Although petroleum is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance, in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of “hazardous substance.”  By operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially








responsible person, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.



Clean Air Act



Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state statutes and regulations.  The EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act contain requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from stationary sources.   For further information, see“—Climate Change”below.



Clean Water Act



Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of fills and pollutants into waters of the U.S.  The discharge of fills and pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal or state authorities.  The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to prevention of and response to oil spills.  Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil.



EPA Revisions to Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS)



As required by the Clean Air Act, the EPA establishes National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for how much pollution is permissible, and the states then have to adopt rules so their air quality meets the NAAQS.  In October 2015, the EPA published a rule lowering the ground level ozone NAAQS from 75 ppb to a more stringent 70 ppb standard.  This change triggered a process under which the EPA designated the areas of the country in or out of compliance with the new NAAQS standard.  Now, certain states will have to adopt more stringent air quality regulations to meet the new NAAQS standard.  These new state rules, which are expected in 2020 or 2021, will likely require the installation of more stringent air pollution controls on newly-installed equipment and possibly require the retrofitting of existing KMI facilities with air pollution controls.  Given the nationwide implications of the new rule, it is expected that it will have financial impacts for each of our business units.



Climate Change



Due to concern over climate change, numerous proposals to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the federal, state and local levels of government.  Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and CO2, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of GHGs.  Various laws and regulations exist or are under development to regulate the emission of such GHGs, including the EPA programs to report GHG emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. The U.S. Congress has in the past considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs.



Beginning in December 2009, EPA published several findings and rulemakings under the Clean Air Act requiring the permitting and reporting of certain GHGs, including CO2and methane. Our facilities are subject to these requirements. Operational and/or regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with GHG emissions reporting and permitting requirements.



On October 23, 2015, the EPA published as a final rule the Clean Power Plan, which sets interim and final CO2emission performance rates for power generating units that are fueled by coal, oil or natural gas.  The final rule is the focus of legislative discussion in the U.S. Congress and litigation in federal court.  On February 10, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the final rule, effectively suspending the duty to comply with the rule until certain legal challenges are resolved.  In October 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the Clean Power Plan.  In August 2018, the EPA proposed to replace the Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy rule.  The ultimate determination of the Clean Power Plan and Affordable Clean Energy rule remains uncertain.  While we do not operate power plants that would be subject to the Clean Power Plan or the Affordable Clean Energy rule, it remains unclear what effect a final rule, if it comes into force, might have on the anticipated demand for natural gas, including natural gas that we gather, process, store and transport.



At the state level, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional GHG “cap and trade” programs.  Although many of the state-level initiatives have to date been








focused on large sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that sources such as our gas-fueled compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations.  Various states are also proposing or have implemented stricter regulations for GHGs that go beyond the requirements of the EPA. Some of the states have implemented regulations that require additional monitoring and reporting of methane emissions.  Depending on the state programs pending implementation, we could be required to conduct additional monitoring, do additional emissions reporting and/or purchase and surrender emission allowances.



Because our operations, including the compressor stations and processing plants, emit various types of GHGs, primarily methane and CO2, such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities.  Depending on the particular law, regulation or program, we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment or emission controls on the facilities, acquire and surrender allowances for the GHG emissions, pay taxes related to the GHG emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program.  We are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated companies in our industry, they could be significant to us.  While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries’ pipelines, recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control, including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or other regulatory bodies, and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.



Many climate models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding.  We may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  These climate-related changes could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone and rain-susceptible regions.  However, the timing, severity and location of these climate change impacts are not known with certainty and, these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over varying time horizons.



Because the combustion of natural gas produces less GHG emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or EPA regulatory initiatives such as the Clean Power Plan or Affordable Clean Energy rule could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of competing fuels such as coal and oil.  In addition, we anticipate that GHG regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our CO2business segment.  However, these potential positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.  Although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts, GHG regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Department of Homeland Security



The Department of Homeland Security, referred to in this report as the DHS, has regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical facilities.  The DHS has promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards.  This process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet DHS-defined, risk-based performance standards.  The DHS has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule; therefore, neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.





Other



Employees



We employed 11,086 full-time personnel atDecember 31, 2019, including approximately 954 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2020 and 2023.  We consider relations with our employees to be good.



Most of our employees are employed by us and a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units.  The direct costs of compensation, benefits expenses, employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries. Our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services, and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries pursuant to








our board-approved expense allocation policy.  The effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees, as the case may be, while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs.
