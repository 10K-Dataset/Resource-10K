(a) General Development of Business





Organizational Structure



On February 10, 2011, we converted from a Delaware limited liability company named Kinder Morgan Holdco LLC to a Delaware corporation named Kinder Morgan, Inc. and our outstanding units were converted into classes of our capital stock.  These transactions are referred to herein as the “Conversion Transaction.”  On February 16, 2011, we completed the initial public offering of our Class P common stock, which is sometimes referred to herein as our “common stock.” All of the common stock that was sold in the offering was sold by our existing investors consisting of funds advised by or affiliated with Goldman Sachs & Co., Highstar Capital LP, The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings LLC, referred to herein as the “Sponsor Investors.”  No members of management sold shares in the offering, and we did not receive any proceeds from the offering.



Upon the completion of our initial public offering of Class P common stock we were owned by the public, and by individuals and entities that were the owners of Kinder Morgan Holdco LLC, which are referred to collectively in this report as the “Investors.”  The Investors were Richard D. Kinder, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; the Sponsor Investors; Fayez Sarofim, one of our directors, and investment entities affiliated with him, and an investment entity affiliated with Michael C. Morgan, another of our directors, and William V. Morgan, one of our founders, whom we refer to collectively as the “Original Stockholders”; and a number of other members of our management, who are referred to collectively as “Other Management.”



The Investors owned all of our outstanding Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares, which are sometimes referred to in this report as the “investor retained stock.”  Our Class A shares represented the total capital contributed by the Investors (and a notional amount of capital allocated to the contribution of the holders of the Class C shares) at the time of the Going Private Transaction. The Class B shares and Class C shares represented incentive compensation that were held by members of our management, including Mr. Kinder only in the case of the Class B shares.



During the year ended December 31, 2012, certain of the Sponsor Investors (the Selling Stockholders) completed underwritten public offerings (the Offerings) of an aggregate of198,996,921 sharesof our Class P common stock (including 8,700,000 shares that were the subject of an underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares). Neither we nor our management sold any shares of common stock in the Offerings, and we did not receive any of the proceeds from the offerings of shares by the Selling Stockholders. As a result of these offerings, the Sponsor Investors advised by or affiliated with










Goldman Sachs & Co., The Carlyle Group, and Riverstone Holdings LLC no longer own any of our shares, and representatives of these Sponsor Investors are no longer on our board.



On December 26, 2012, the remaining series of the Class A, Class B and Class C shares held by the Investors automatically converted into shares of Class P common stock upon the election of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of each such series of Class A common stock and the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of each such series of Class B common stock. Subsequent to these conversions, all our Class A, Class B and Class C shares were fully converted and as a result, only our Class P common stock was outstanding as of December 31, 2012.   Additionally, as Class A, Class B and Class C shares converted, certain holders of the Class P shares were paid out in cash and their Class P shares were immediately canceled. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately2 millionand less than1 million, respectively, Class P shares were canceled resulting in payments totaling approximately$71 millionand$2 million, respectively, to the holders of those shares.

We conduct most of our business through our master limited partnerships (KMP and EPB).  KMP is a Delaware limited partnership formed in August 1992, and its common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KMP.” Kinder Morgan Management, LLC, referred to as KMR in this report, is a Delaware limited liability company formed in February 2001. KMP’s general partner, Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., owns all of KMR’s voting securities.  Pursuant to a delegation of control agreement, Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc. has delegated to KMR, to the fullest extent permitted under Delaware law and KMP’s partnership agreement, all of its power and authority to manage and control KMP’s business and affairs, except that KMR cannot take certain specified actions without the approval of KMP’s general partner.  KMR’s shares representing limited liability company interests are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “KMR.”  EPB is a Delaware limited partnership formed in 2007, and its common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “EPB.” EPB’s general partner is El Paso Pipeline GP Company, L.L.C., all of whose stock we indirectly own.

The equity interests in KMP, EPB and KMR (which are all consolidated in our financial statements) owned by the public are reflected within “noncontrolling interests” in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  The earnings recorded by KMP, EPB and KMR that are attributed to their units and shares, respectively, held by the public are reported as noncontrolling interests” in our accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Recent Developments

The following is a brief listing of significant developments since December 31, 2011.  We begin with developments pertaining to our reportable business segments.  Additional information regarding most of these items may be found elsewhere in this report.

Natural Gas Pipelines



KMP



▪Effective November 1, 2012, we sold KMP's FTC Natural Gas Pipelines disposal group to Tallgrass Energy Partners, L.P. for approximately $1.8 billion (before selling costs), or $3.3 billion including our share of joint venture debt, to satisfy terms of a March 15, 2012 agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to divest certain of KMP's assets in order to receive regulatory approval for our EP acquisition.  KMP's FTC Natural Gas Pipelines disposal group's assets included  (i) Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission natural gas pipeline system; (ii) Trailblazer natural gas pipeline system; (iii) Casper and Douglas natural gas processing operations; and (iv) 50% equity investment in the Rockies Express natural gas pipeline system.  In this report, we refer to this combined group of assets as KMP's FTC Natural Gas Pipelines disposal group.  During 2012, we recognized a combined $937 million loss from both the










remeasurement and sale of net assets.  Pursuant to current accounting principles, we reclassified and reported the FTC Natural Gas Pipelines disposal group's results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report.  For more information about this divestiture, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report;

▪On June 1, 2012, KMP acquired a 50% equity ownership interest in El Paso Midstream Investment Company, LLC, referred to in this report as EPMIC, from an investment vehicle affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. for an aggregate consideration of $289 million in common units.  The remaining 50% of the joint venture we acquired as part of our acquisition of EP on May 25, 2012.  EPMIC owns the Altamont natural gas gathering, processing and treating assets located in the Uinta Basin in Utah, and the Camino Real natural gas and oil gathering system located in the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas.  Additionally, we have offered to sell both our 50% ownership interest in EPMIC and our 50% ownership interest in the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline system (discussed following) to KMP in 2013 (in a future drop-down transaction);

▪On August 1, 2012, KMP acquired the full ownership interest in the Tennessee Gas natural gas pipeline system and a 50% ownership interest in the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline system from us for an aggregate consideration of approximately $6.2 billion, consisting of the combined amount of cash paid, common units issued and debt assumed.  In this report, we refer to transfer of assets from us to KMP as the drop-down transaction, the combined group of assets acquired from us as the drop-down asset group, the Tennessee Gas natural gas pipeline system or Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, L.L.C. as TGP, and the El Paso Natural Gas pipeline system or El Paso Natural Gas Pipeline Company, LLC as EPNG.

We acquired the drop-down asset group as part of the EP acquisition on May 25, 2012, and current accounting principles require us to account for the drop-down transaction as a transfer of net assets between entities under common control.  Accordingly, we prepared our consolidated financial statements and the related financial information contained in this report to reflect the transfer of the drop-down asset group from us to KMP as if such transfer had taken place on May 25, 2012.  For further information about the drop-down transaction, see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report;

▪On October 1, 2012, following approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), TGP placed in service a portion of its approximately $55 million Northeast Supply Diversification project to support interim customer capacity requirements.  The fully subscribed project provides a bi-directional meter on the Niagara Spur with approximately six miles of pipeline looping on TGP's system.  Fully placed in service in November 2012, the project creates an additional approximately 245 million cubic feet per day of firm service capacity from the Marcellus shale region along TGP's system to serve existing markets in New England and the Niagara Falls area of New York;

▪On October 10, 2012, TGP filed a certificate application with the FERC, proposing its Rose Lake expansion project, which would provide long-term firm natural gas transportation service for two shippers that have fully subscribed approximately 225 million cubic feet per day of firm capacity offered in TGP's Zone 4 in Pennsylvania.  The capacity was offered in a binding open season held in the summer of 2012.  TGP proposes to retire older compressor units, add new, more efficient and cleaner burning units, and make other modifications involving three existing compressor stations that serve its 300 Line, all located in northeastern Pennsylvania.  The anticipated in service date for the approximately $92 million project is November 1, 2014;

▪In the fourth quarter of 2012, KMP's wholly owned subsidiary, Sierrita Gas Pipeline LLC (a newly created interstate natural gas pipeline company) entered into a 25-year transportation agreement in connection with plans to build a new pipeline to serve customers in Mexico.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Sierrita will construct new facilities that will initially provide approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of firm natural gas transportation capacity via a new, 60-mile, 36-inch diameter lateral pipeline that would extend from EPNG's existing south mainlines (near the City of Tucson, Arizona) to the U.S.-Mexico border (near the town of Sasabe, Arizona).  The proposed $200 million Sierrita Gas pipeline would interconnect with a new 36-inch diameter natural gas pipeline to be built in Mexico.  Sierrita Gas Pipeline LLC filed an application with the FERC on February 7, 2013, and subject to FERC approval, we expect that construction of the Sierrita pipeline would begin in the first quarter of 2014. We anticipate that the pipeline would be placed into service in the fall of 2014;

▪In December 2012, TGP received notices to proceed from the FERC for its proposed approximately $86 million Marcellus Pooling project.  The fully subscribed project will provide approximately 240 million cubic feet per day of additional firm transportation capacity from the prolific Marcellus natural gas shale formation.  The expansion includes approximately eight miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline looping, system modifications and upgrades to allow bi-directional flow at four existing compressor stations in Pennsylvania.  Construction is anticipated to occur primarily this










summer and the project is expected to be in service in November of 2013;



▪

▪On January 29, 2013, KMP and Copano Energy, L.L.C., referred to in this report as Copano, announced a definitive agreement whereby KMP has agreed to acquire all of Copano's outstanding units, including convertible preferred units, for a total purchase price of approximately $5 billion, including the assumption of debt.  The transaction, which has been approved by the board of directors of Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., KMP's general partner, and the board of directors of Copano, will be a 100% unit for unit transaction with an exchange ratio of 0.4563 KMP common units per each Copano common unit.  The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and a vote of the Copano unitholders. TPG Advisors VI, Inc., Copano's largest unitholder, has agreed to support the transaction, and we expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of 2013.

Copano is a midstream natural gas company that provides comprehensive services to natural gas producers, including natural gas gathering, processing, treating and natural gas liquids fractionation.  Copano owns an interest in or operates approximately 6,900 miles of pipelines with2.7billion cubic feet per day of natural gas transportation capacity, and also owns nine natural gas processing plants with more than1.0billion cubic feet per day of natural gas processing capacity and315million cubic feet per day of natural gas treating capacity.  Its operations are located primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming.

The acquisition of Copano is expected to be accretive to cash available for distribution to KMP’s unitholders, and it is expected to be accretive to our cash available to pay dividends, upon closing.  We, as the parent of KMP’s general partner, have agreed to forego a portion of our incremental incentive distributions in 2013 in an amount dependent on the time of closing.  Additionally, we intend to forego $120 million in 2014, $120 million in 2015, $110 million in 2016 and annual amounts thereafter decreasing by $5 million per year.  The transaction is expected to be modestly accretive to KMP in 2013, given the partial year, and about $0.10 per unit accretive for at least the next five years beginning in 2014.

EPB

▪On May 24, 2012, EPB acquired from EP the remaining 14% interest in Colorado Interstate Gas Company, L.L.C.  and all of Cheyenne Plains Investment Company, L.L.C., and Cheyenne Plains Gas Pipeline Company, L.L.C., which we refer to in this report as CIG, CPI and CPG, respectively. CPI owns CPG.  CPG is a pipeline system that extends from the Cheyenne hub in Weld County, Colorado and extends southerly to a variety of delivery locations in the vicinity of the Greensburg Hub in Kiowa County, Kansas. CPG provides pipeline take-away capacity from the natural gas basins in the Central Rocky Mountain area to the major natural gas markets in the Mid-Continent region; and

▪On January 28, 2013, Shell US Gas & Power and Southern Liquefaction Company, L.L.C., a subsidiary of EPB, announced their intent to develop a natural gas liquefaction plant through a joint venture, Elba Liquefaction Company (Elba Liquefaction). The project will occur in two phases at EPB's existing Elba terminal near Savannah, Georgia.  Subject to various corporate and regulatory approvals, Elba Liquefaction has agreed to modify EPB's Elba Express Pipeline and Elba Island LNG terminal to physically transport natural gas to the terminal and load the liquefied natural gas (LNG) onto ships for export.  Once finalized, EPB affiliates will own 51 % of the venture and be its operator and Shell affiliates will own the remaining 49% and contract for 100% of the liquefaction capacity.












Products Pipelines-KMP



▪In August 2012, KMP and Valero Energy Corporation began construction on their previously announced Parkway Pipeline, a new 141-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline, which is expected to cost $220 million, that will transport refined petroleum products from refineries located in Norco, Louisiana, to Plantation Pipe Line Company's (KMP's approximately 51%-owned equity investee) petroleum transportation hub located in Collins, Mississippi.  KMP has substantially completed the Lake Pontchartrain portion of the pipeline, and construction activities continue on land in Louisiana and Mississippi.  Upon completion, KMP will operate and own a 50% equity interest in the Parkway Pipeline, which will have an initial capacity of 110,000 barrels per day, with the ability to expand to over 200,000 barrels per day.  The pipeline project is supported by a long-term throughput agreement with a credit-worthy shipper and is scheduled to be in service in September 2013;

▪On August 23, 2012, KMP announced that it would invest approximately $90 million to build a 27-mile, 12-inch diameter lateral pipeline that will extend its Kinder Morgan crude oil/condensate pipeline to Phillips 66's Sweeny refinery located in Brazoria County, Texas.  KMP will provide Phillips 66 with a significant portion of the lateral's initial capacity of 30,000 barrels per day, which is expandable to 100,000 barrels per day.  KMP will also add associated receipt facilities by constructing a five-bay truck offloading facility and three new storage tanks with approximately 360,000 barrels of crude oil/condensate capacity at stations located in DeWitt and Wharton counties in Texas.  KMP began construction in December 2012, and expects to place the lateral into service in the second quarter of 2013;

▪In October 2012, KMP began transporting crude oil and condensate volumes on previously announced Kinder Morgan crude oil/condensate pipeline, which transports available capacity from the production area in the Eagle Ford shale gas formation in South Texas to the Houston Ship Channel.  The approximately $213 million pipeline, which has a capacity of 300,000 barrels per day, was completed on time and under budget, and is supported by long-term contractual commitments.  The pipeline consists of approximately 65 miles of new pipeline construction and 109 miles of converted natural gas pipeline, and it delivers product to multiple terminaling facilities that provide access to local refineries, petrochemical plants and docks along the Texas Gulf Coast;

▪In December 2012, KMP completed its previously announced refined petroleum products storage expansion project at its West Coast Terminals' Carson, California products terminal.  The approximately $77 million expansion project added seven storage tanks with a combined capacity of 560,000 barrels.  KMP completed and placed into service the first two storage tanks in October 2011 and the remaining five tanks in the third and fourth quarters of 2012.  The project was completed on budget and ahead of schedule, and all seven tanks have been leased under long-term agreements with large U.S. oil refiners.  By year-end 2012, KMP also completed facility modifications to provide for the receipt, storage and blending of biodiesel at the Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; and Fresno, California terminals and began blending operations by the end of January 2013;

▪KMP continues design and pre-construction activities for its approximately $200 million petroleum condensate processing facility, located near its Galena Park terminal on the Houston Ship Channel.  The facility which is supported by a fee-based contract with BP North America has an anticipated throughput capacity of about 50,000 barrels per day and can be expanded to process 100,000 barrels per day.  KMI expects the facility to be in service in the first quarter of 2014.  Through a fee structure, BP North America is underwriting the initial throughput of the facility.  In light of the growth of Eagle Ford shale NGL production and the associated need for additional condensate processing capacity, KMP expects to obtain additional customer commitments to underwrite an expansion at this facility; and

▪As of the date of this report, KMP is in the final permitting stage for its previously announced Cochin Pipeline reversal project, which will allow KMP to offer a new service to move light condensate from Kankakee County, Illinois to existing terminal facilities located near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta, Canada.  KMP received more than 100,000 barrels per day of binding commitments for a minimum ten-year term during a successful open season completed in June 2012.  The approximately $260 million project involves both modifying the Western leg of the Cochin Pipeline to Fort Saskatchewan from a point of interconnection with Explorer Pipeline Company's pipeline in  and building  a one million barrel tank farm and associated piping and interconnect with Explorer Pipeline Company's pipeline at the Kankakee County point of interconnection.  Subject to the timely receipt of necessary regulatory approvals, light condensate shipments could begin as early as July 1, 2014.

CO2-KMP



▪On January 18, 2012, KMP announced an approximately $255 million investment to expand the carbon dioxide capacity of its approximately 87%-owned Doe Canyon Deep unit in southwestern Colorado.  The expansion project will include the installation of both primary and booster compression and is expected to increase Doe Canyon's production rate from










105 million cubic feet of carbon dioxide per day to 170 million cubic feet per day.  As of the date of this report, construction continues on both primary and booster compression. KMP expects to complete and place in service the primary compression in the fourth quarter of 2013, and complete the booster compression in the second quarter of 2014.  Additionally, KMP plans to drill approximately 19 more wells during the next ten years, with one well completed in 2012 and four more wells to be drilled in 2013; and

▪On January 31, 2012, KMP acquired a carbon dioxide source field and related assets located in Apache County, Arizona, and Catron County, New Mexico from a subsidiary of Enhanced Oil Resources for $30 million in cash.  The acquisition included all of Enhanced Oil's rights, title, and interest in the carbon dioxide and helium located in the St. Johns gas unit and the Cottonwood Canyon carbon dioxide unit.  KMP refers to this combined group of assets as the St. Johns CO2source field, and as of the date of this report, continues to test wells and perform predevelopment activities.  KMP anticipates that carbon dioxide production from this potential new source field would be transported to the Permian Basin for use by customers in tertiary oil recovery.

Terminals-KMP



▪On July 17, 2012, KMP and Peabody Energy announced that they had entered into certain long-term agreements to secure and expand the export platform for Peabody Energy's Colorado, Powder River Basin and Illinois Basin coal products.  Pursuant to the provisions of these agreements, Peabody will gain additional access to export coal (i) through 2021 at KMP's Houston Bulk and Deepwater terminal facilities located near Houston and (ii) through 2020 at KMP's International Marine Terminals facility (IMT), a multi-product, import-export facility located in Myrtle Grove, Louisiana and owned 66 2/3% by KMP.

Due to the finalization of these agreements, and to previously announced coal throughput agreements with Arch Coal Company, KMP is proceeding with Phase 3 of its export coal expansion project at IMT.  The project entails adding a new continuous barge unloader, a new reclaim system and an additional 5 million tons of coal storage capacity.  We expect the new Phase 3 project to be operational in the second quarter 2014. We estimate KMP’s share of the total expansion project at IMT (including all phases) will cost approximately $150 million. When completed, KMP’s total export coal capacity (for all terminals combined) will be approximately 44.7 million short-tons per year;

▪On July 19, 2012, KMP and BP North America announced the execution of a long-term lease agreement whereby BP will lease an additional 750,000 barrels of refined products capacity at KMP's Galena Park, Texas liquids terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel.  BP's products will be processed at the condensate splitter that KMP is also currently building near the Galena Park facility and, in conjunction with the lease agreement, KMP agreed to build five new tanks, which will provide storage for BP's product.  As of the date of this report, construction continues on the approximately $75 million investment;

▪Effective December 1, 2012, TransMontaigne exercised its previously announced option to acquire up to 50% of KMP's Class A member interest in Battleground Oil Specialty Terminal Company LLC (BOSTCO).  On this date, TransMontaigne acquired a 42.5% Class A member interest in BOSTCO from KMP for an aggregate consideration of $79 million, and following this acquisition, KMP now owns a 55% Class A member interest in BOSTCO (KMP sold a 2.5% Class A member interest in BOSTCO to a third party on January 1, 2012. As of the date of this report, construction continues on the previously announced approximately $430 million BOSTCO oil terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel.  The first phase of the project includes construction of 52 storage tanks with a capacity of 6.5 million barrels for handling residual fuels, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils.  Terminal service agreements or letters of intent have been executed with customers for almost all of the capacity.  Commercial operations are expected to begin in the third quarter of 2013;

▪On January 14, 2013, KMP announced an expansion project and an acquisition that will provide additional infrastructure to help meet growing demand for liquids storage and dock services along the Texas Gulf Coast.  The combined investment will cost approximately $170 million will include the purchase of 42 acres of land, construction of a new ship dock to handle ocean going vessels, and construction of 1.2 million barrels of liquids storage tanks (six 150,000-barrel tanks and four 75,000-barrel tanks).  KMP has entered into a letter of intent with a major oil refiner to develop the tanks with connectivity between our Galena Park liquids terminal and the refiner's Houston Ship Channel refinery.  The property will be used to provide dock services for up to eight vessels a month for the refinery and up to four vessels a month for KMP's Galena Park terminal; and

▪As of the date of this report, construction also continues on the previously announced Edmonton terminal expansion in Strathcona County, Alberta, Canada.  The approximately $310 million phase one project entails building ten tanks with combined new merchant and system tank storage capacity of approximately 3.6 million barrels.  The project is expected










to be fully completed in December 2013 and is underpinned by long-term commercial agreements with major Canadian oil producers.   On January 23, 2013, KMP announced that it had entered into long-term contracts to support the construction of an additional 1.2 million barrels consisting of four new tanks of merchant storage capacity at the Edmonton terminal.  This phase two project is scheduled to commence in the spring of 2013, following receipt of supporting permits, and KMP expects to complete construction in the late third quarter of 2014.  It is estimated that this phase two project will cost approximately $112 million and, when complete, will bring total storage capacity at the Edmonton facility to 9.4 million barrels (including the existing Trans Mountain system facility and KMP's North 40 crude oil tank farm).

Kinder Morgan Canada -KMP



▪On May 23, 2012, Kinder Morgan Canada’s subsidiary, Trans Mountain Pipeline L.P., (Trans Mountain) confirmed binding commercial support for its previously announced proposed expansion of its Trans Mountain pipeline system and, on January 10, 2013, Trans Mountain updated the binding commercial support following the completion of a supplemental open season.  A total of thirteen companies in the Canadian producing and oil marketing business have signed firm contracts bringing the total volume of committed shippers to approximately 710,000 barrels per day.  Trans Mountain is currently in the final stages of securing approval for the commercial terms of this expansion from Canada’s National Energy Board, referred to in this report as the NEB.  Failure to secure NEB approval of this project at a reasonable toll rate could require us to either delay or cancel this project.  We anticipate NEB’s approval in the second quarter of 2013.



Originating in Edmonton, Alberta, Kinder Morgan Canada’s Trans Mountain system is currently designed to carry up to 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the northwest U.S. and on the west coast of British Columbia and based on the current confirmed shipper response, Kinder Morgan Canada would complete the construction of a twin pipeline that could boost system capacity to over 890,000 barrels per day.  Trans Mountain plans to file a Facilities Application with the NEB in late 2013 to seek authorization to build and operate the necessary facilities for the expansion.  This filing will initiate a comprehensive regulatory and public review of the proposed expansion.  If the application is approved, construction is currently forecast to commence in 2015 or 2016 with the proposed expansion commencing operations in late 2017.  The current estimate of total project construction costs is approximately $5.4 billion; and



▪On December 11, 2012, Kinder Morgan Canada announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell both its one-third equity ownership interest in the Express pipeline system and the subordinated debt investment in Express to Spectra Energy Corp. for approximately $380 million (before tax).  The Express pipeline system is a common carrier, crude oil pipeline system comprised of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline, collectively referred to in this report as the Express pipeline system.  The approximate 1,700-mile integrated oil transportation pipeline system connects Canadian and U.S. producers to refineries located in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions.  Based on the structure of the investment with its Express-Platte partners, Kinder Morgan Canada receives approximately $15 million of cash flow on an annual basis from this investment, which is primarily debenture interest.  Kinder Morgan Canada will redeploy the proceeds from this sale into various growth projects to further benefit unitholders. The transaction is subject to customary consents and regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013.  In December 2012, Spectra also announced that it will acquire the remaining ownership interests in Express and, following its acquisitions, will fully own the Express pipeline system.



Other Segment



▪On January 18, 2013, we completed the sale of our equity interests in the Bolivia to Brazil Pipeline that we had acquired as part of the EP acquisition for $88 million. See Note 3 "Acquisitions and Divestitures" to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

▪As KMP previously announced, it anticipates that for the year 2013 (i) it will declare cash distributions of $5.28 per unit, a 6% increase over its cash distributions of $4.98 per unit for 2012; (ii) its business segments will generate approximately $5.4 billion in earnings before all non-cash depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, including amortization of excess cost of equity investments and its proportionate share of all non-cash depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses of certain joint ventures accounted for under the equity-method of accounting; (iii) it will distribute over $2.0 billion to its limited partners; (iv) it will produce excess cash flow of more than $30 million above its cash distribution target of $5.28 per unit; and (v) it will invest approximately $2.9 billion for its capital expansion program (including small acquisitions and contributions to joint ventures, but excluding acquisitions from us). KMP's anticipated 2013 expansion investment will help drive earnings and cash flow growth in 2013 and beyond, and it is estimated that approximately $625 million of the equity required for its 2013 investment program will be funded by cash retained as a function of distributions to KMR being paid in additional units rather than in cash.

KMP’s expectations assume an average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price of approximately $91.68 per barrel in 2013.  Although the overwhelming majority of the cash generated by KMP’s assets is fee based and is not sensitive to commodity prices, the CO2-KMP business segment is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of crude oil and natural gas liquids.  KMP hedges the majority of its crude oil production, but does have exposure to unhedged volumes, the majority of which are natural gas liquids volumes.  For 2013, it is expected that every $1 change in the average WTI crude oil price per barrel will impact the CO2-KMP segment’s cash flows by approximately $6 million (or approximately 0.1% of the combined business segments’ anticipated earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses).

EPB

▪EPB estimates that in 2013 it will declare cash distributions of $2.55 per unit, a 13% increase over its 2012 distribution of $2.25 per unit.  EPB’s 2013 budget includes the expected acquisition of 50% of Gulf LNG Energy LLC from us.  EPB’s growth is expected to be driven by its stable, regulated natural gas pipelines and storage assets, its LNG businesses and incremental cost savings and synergies relative to our purchase of EP.  EPB estimates that it will produce excess cash flow of more than $25 million above its 2013 cash distribution target.



KMI

▪In 2013, we expect to sell our remaining 50% interest in EPNG and 50% interest in EPMIC to KMP, and our 50% interest in Gulf LNG Holdings Group LLC to EPB.

▪KMI expects to declare dividends of $1.57 per share for 2013, a 16% increase over its budgeted 2012 declared dividend of $1.35 per share and a 12% increase from its actual 2012 declared dividend of $1.40 per share.  Growth at KMI in 2013 is expected to be driven by the continued strong performance at KMP, along with contributions from EPB and the natural gas assets KMI acquired in the EP transaction

(c) Narrative Description of Business





Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to:

▪focus on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure of growing markets within North America;

▪increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and employing environmentally sound










operating practices;

▪leverage economies of scale from incremental acquisitions and expansions of assets that fit within our strategy and are accretive to cash flow; and

▪maximize the benefits of our financial structure to create and return value to our stockholders.

It is our intention to carry out the above business strategy, modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances.  However, as discussed under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below, there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out.

We (primarily through KMP and EPB) regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions.  Any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions, receipt of fairness opinions, if applicable, and approval of the parties’ respective boards of directors.  While there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets, such transactions can be effected quickly, may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations.



Business Segments

We own and manage a diversified portfolio of energy transportation and storage assets.  Our operations are conducted through the following reportable business segments:

▪Natural Gas Pipelines—for all periods presented in our financial statements this segment consists of approximately 62,000 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and gathering lines, plus natural gas storage, treating and processing facilities, through which natural gas is gathered, transported, stored, treated, processed and sold and equity earnings from our 20% interest in NGPL Holdco LLC. Following our May 25, 2012 EP acquisition, this segment also includes the natural gas operations of EP, its subsidiaries (including EPB) and its equity investments;

Natural Gas Pipelines

Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines and our liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminals, and includes both FERC regulated and non-FERC regulated assets.  Our non-FERC regulated assets are contained in KMP’s Midstream Group.

Our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas sales, transportation, storage, gathering, processing and treating, and the terminaling of LNG. Within this segment, are: (i)  KMP’s assets - approximately 34,000 miles of natural gas pipelines; and (ii) EPB’s assets - approximately 13,000 miles of natural gas pipelines; and (iii) our equity interests in entities that have approximately 15,000 miles of natural gas pipelines (excludes KMI’s 50% interest in EPNG, which is included in KMP’s mileage), along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks, that are strategically located










throughout the North American natural gas pipeline grid.  KMP’s transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas in the western U.S., Texas, the Midwest and Northeast, as well as major consumer markets. EPB’s transportation network provides access to the major gas supply areas and consumer markets in the Rocky Mountain, Midwest and Southeastern regions.  EPB’s LNG storage and regasification terminal also serves natural gas supply areas in the southeast.



KMP

KMP Midstream Group

Texas Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Group

The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group, which operates primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast, consists of the following four natural gas pipeline systems: (i) Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline; (ii) Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline; (iii) Mier-Monterrey Mexico Pipeline; and (iv) Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline.

The two largest systems in the group are Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline and our Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline.  These pipelines essentially operate as a single pipeline system, providing customers and suppliers with improved flexibility and reliability.  The combined system includes approximately 5,800 miles of intrastate natural gas pipelines with a peak transport and sales capacity of approximately 5.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and approximately 130 billion cubic feet of on-system natural gas storage capacity, including approximately 11 billion cubic feet contracted from third parties. In addition, the combined system (i) has facilities to both treat approximately 180 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide removal, and to process approximately 85 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for liquids extraction and (ii) holds contractual rights to process natural gas at certain third party facilities.



The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline consists of a 95-mile natural gas pipeline that stretches from the international border between the U.S. and Mexico in Starr County, Texas, to Monterrey, Mexico and can transport up to 425 million cubic feet per day.  The pipeline connects to the Pemex natural gas transportation system and serves a 1,000-megawatt power plant complex.  KMP has entered into a long-term contract (expiring in 2018) with Pemex, which has subscribed for substantially all of the pipeline’s capacity.



KMP’s Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline consists of an 82-mile pipeline that transports natural gas from an interconnect with the facilities of Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America LLC (a 20%-owned equity investee of us and referred to in this report as NGPL) in Lamar County, Texas to a 1,750-megawatt electricity generating facility located in Forney, Texas, 15 miles east of Dallas, Texas and to a 1,000 megawatt facility located near Paris, Texas.  It has the capacity to transport 325 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and is fully subscribed under a long-term contract that expires in 2032.  The system is bi-directional, permitting deliveries of additional supply from the Barnett Shale area to NGPL’s pipeline as well as power plants in the area.



Texas is one of the largest natural gas consuming states in the country.  The natural gas demand profile in KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group’s market area is primarily composed of industrial (including on-site cogeneration facilities), merchant and utility power, and local natural gas distribution consumption.  The industrial demand is primarily a year-round load.  Merchant and utility power demand peaks in the summer months and is complemented by local natural gas distribution demand that peaks in the winter months.



Collectively, KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system primarily serves the Texas Gulf Coast by selling, transporting, processing and treating natural gas from multiple onshore and offshore supply sources to serve the Houston/Beaumont/Port Arthur/Austin industrial markets, local natural gas distribution utilities, electric utilities and merchant power generation markets.  It serves as a buyer and seller of natural gas, as well as a transporter of natural gas.  In 2012, the four natural gas pipeline systems in the Texas intrastate group provided an average of approximately 2.69 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas transport services.  The Texas intrastate group also sold approximately 879.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2012.



The purchases and sales of natural gas are primarily priced with reference to market prices in the consuming region of the system.  The difference between the purchase and sale prices is the rough equivalent of a transportation fee and fuel costs.  Generally, KMP purchases natural gas directly from producers with reserves connected to its intrastate natural gas system in South Texas, East Texas, West Texas, and along the Texas Gulf Coast.  In addition, KMP also purchase gas at interconnects with third-party interstate and intrastate pipelines.  While the intrastate group does not produce gas, it does maintain an active well connection program in order to offset natural declines in production along its system and to secure










supplies for additional demand in its market area.  KMP’s intrastate system has access to both onshore and offshore sources of supply, and is interconnected with both liquefied natural gas import terminals located on the Texas Gulf Coast.  The intrastate group also has access to markets within and outside of Texas through interconnections with numerous interstate natural gas pipelines.

Cheyenne Plains Gas Company, L.L.C. (CPG)



CPG is a 400-mile pipeline system that extends from Cheyenne Hub in Weld County, Colorado and extends southerly to a variety of delivery locations in the vicinity of the Greensburg Hub in Kiowa County, Kansas. CPG provides pipeline takeaway capacity from the natural gas basins in the Central Rocky Mountain area to the major natural gas markets in the Mid-Continent










region and has 1,105 Mmcf per day transportation capacity. CPG has high interconnectivity at the Cheyenne Hub. The Cheyenne Hub is connected directly or indirectly to all major pipelines within the Rockies, which gather from all major producing basins in the region. CPG’s interconnects near Greensburg, Kansas continue to benefit customers in the mid-continent by continuing to provide increased reliability (due to pipeline diversity), increased optionality (due to supply basin diversity), and advantageous pricing (due to gas-on-gas competition). CPG’s capacity to move Rockies production from the Cheyenne Hub area remains a vital link and along with sustained growth projections in Rockies production through 2022, CPG is well positioned to accommodate any future increase in Rockies production.  In addition, CPG is ideally positioned to accommodate the expected surge in incremental production from associated gas within the high liquid content plays out of the Denver Basin



Southern LNG Company, L.L.C. (SNLG)





In June 2012, SLNG received authorization from the Department of Energy (DOE) to export domestically produced LNG of up to 4 million tons per year (equivalent to approximately 0.5 Bcf of natural gas per day) to countries with which the U.S has a free trade agreement.  In August 2012, SLNG filed an application with the DOE requesting authorization to export up to 4 million tons per year of LNG from the Elba Island LNG terminal.  The authorization would allow the export of LNG from the terminal to any non FTA country.



In January 2013, Southern Liquefaction Company, LLC (SLC), a unit of EPB, and Shell US Gas and Power LLC (SUSGP), a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell plc, announced plans to develop a natural gas liquefaction plant in two phases at SLNG.  SLC will own 51% of the entity and SUSGP will own the remaining 49%.  SLNG will modify its facilities at Elba Island and will operate the facility.  Phase I of the project, approximately 210 Mmcfd (1.5 million tons per year), requires no additional DOE approval.

Competition



The market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive, and new pipelines are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  These operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines, and their shippers, for attachments to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services.  We believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are transportation rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service.  From time to time, other pipeline projects are proposed that would compete with our pipelines, and some proposed pipelines may deliver natural gas to markets we serve from new supply sources closer to those markets.  We do not know whether or when any such projects would be built, or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability.



Shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils.  Several factors influence the demand for natural gas, including price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather.

Combined, the segment is composed of approximately113 owned or operated liquids and bulk terminal facilities and approximately 35 rail transloading and materials handling facilities.  KMP’s terminals are located throughout the U.S. and in portions of Canada.  KMP believes the location of its facilities and its ability to provide flexibility to customers helps keep customers and provides KMP opportunities for expansion.  KMP often classifies its terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or bulk material products.



Liquids Terminals



KMPs liquids terminals operations primarily store refined petroleum products, petrochemicals, ethanol, industrial chemicals and vegetable oil products in aboveground storage tanks and transfer products to and from pipelines, vessels, tank trucks, tank barges, and tank railcars.  Combined, KMP’s approximately 27 liquids terminals facilities possess liquids storage capacity of approximately 60.1 million barrels, and in 2012, these terminals handled approximately 630 million barrels of liquids products, including petroleum products, ethanol and chemicals.



Bulk Terminals



KMPs bulk terminal operations primarily involve dry-bulk material handling services.  KMP also provides conveyor manufacturing and installation, engineering and design services, and in-plant services covering material handling, conveying, maintenance and repair, truck-railcar-marine transloading, railcar switching and miscellaneous marine services.  KMP owns or operates approximately 83 dry-bulk terminals in the U.S. and Canada, and combined, its dry-bulk and material transloading facilities (described below) handled approximately 97 million tons of coal, petroleum coke, fertilizers, steel, ores and other dry-bulk materials in 2012.



Materials Services (rail transloading)



KMP’s materials services operations include rail or truck transloading shipments from one medium of transportation to another conducted at approximately 35 owned and non-owned facilities.  The Burlington Northern Santa Fe, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, Kansas City Southern and A&W railroads provide rail service for these terminal facilities.  Approximately 50% of the products handled are liquids, including an entire spectrum of liquid chemicals, and the rest are dry-bulk products.  Many of the facilities are equipped for bi-modal operation (rail-to-truck, and truck-to-rail) or connect via pipeline to storage facilities.  Several facilities provide railcar storage services.  KMP also designs and builds transloading facilities, performs inventory management services, and provides value-added services such as blending, heating and sparging.



Effective March, 31 2013, TRANSFLO, a wholly owned subsidiary of CSX, will terminate their contract with our materials handling wholly-owned subsidiary, Kinder Morgan Materials Services (KMMS). This contract covered 25 terminals located on the CSX Railroad throughout the southeastern section of the U.S.  KMMS performed transloading services at the 25 terminals, which included rail-to-truck and truck-to-rail transloading of bulk and liquid products.



Competition



KMP is one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in the U.S, based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity.  Its liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals, and terminals owned by oil, chemical and pipeline companies.  Its bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators, terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities, stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminal services.  In some locations, competitors are smaller, independent operators with lower cost structures.  KMP’s rail transloading (material services) operations compete with a variety of single- or multi-site transload, warehouse and terminal operators across the U.S.  its ethanol rail transload operations compete with a variety of ethanol handling terminal sites across the U.S., many offering waterborne service, truck loading, and unit train capability serviced by Class 1 rail carriers.
















Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP



KMP’s Kinder Morgan Canada business segment includes Trans Mountain pipeline system, ownership of a one-third interest in the Express pipeline system, and the 25-mile Jet Fuel pipeline system.  The weighted average remaining life of the shipping contracts on these pipeline systems was approximately two years as of December 31, 2012.



Trans Mountain Pipeline System



The Trans Mountain pipeline system originates at Edmonton, Alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of British Columbia.  Trans Mountain’s pipeline is 715 miles in length.  KMP also owns a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of Washington.  The capacity of the line at Edmonton ranges from 300,000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents 20% of the total throughput (which is a historically normal heavy crude percentage), to 400,000 barrels per day with no heavy crude.  Trans Mountain is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from Alberta to the west coast.  As the recently announced expansion proposal demonstrates, we believe these facilities provide the opportunity to execute on capacity expansions to the west coast, as the market for offshore exports continues to develop.



In 2012, Trans Mountain delivered an average of 291,000 barrels per day.  The crude oil and refined petroleum products transported through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system originates in Alberta and British Columbia.  The refined and partially refined petroleum products transported to Kamloops, British Columbia and Vancouver originates from oil refineries located in Edmonton.  Petroleum products delivered through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system are used in markets in British Columbia, Washington State and elsewhere offshore.



Trans Mountain also operates a 5.3 mile spur line from its Sumas Pump Station to the U.S. - Canada international border where it connects with our approximate 63-mile, 16-inch to 20-inch diameter Puget Sound pipeline system.  The Puget Sound pipeline system in the state of Washington has a sustainable throughput capacity of approximately 135,000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents approximately 25% of throughput, and it connects to four refineries located in northwestern Washington State.  The volumes of crude oil shipped to the state of Washington fluctuate in response to the price levels of Canadian crude oil in relation to crude oil produced in Alaska and other offshore sources.



In February 2013, Trans Mountain completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement effective for the period beginning January 1, 2013 and ending December 31, 2015.  Trans Mountain anticipates NEB approval in the second quarter of 2013.



Express System



KMP owns a one-third ownership interest in the Express pipeline system.  KMP operates the Express pipeline system and accounts for its one-third investment under the equity method of accounting.  The Express pipeline system is a batch-mode, common-carrier, crude oil pipeline system comprised of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline, collectively referred to in this report as the Express pipeline system.  The approximate 1,700-mile integrated oil transportation pipeline connects Canadian and U.S. producers to refineries located in the U.S. Rocky Mountain and Midwest regions.



The Express Pipeline is a 780-mile, 24-inch diameter pipeline that begins at the crude oil pipeline terminal at Hardisty, Alberta and terminates at the Casper, Wyoming facilities of the Platte Pipeline.  The Express Pipeline has a design capacity of 280,000 barrels per day.  Receipts at Hardisty averaged 191,700 barrels per day in 2012.



The Platte Pipeline is a 926-mile, 20-inch diameter pipeline that runs from the crude oil pipeline terminal at Casper, Wyoming to refineries and interconnecting pipelines in the Wood River, Illinois area.  The Platte Pipeline has a current capacity of approximately 150,000 barrels per day downstream of Casper, Wyoming and approximately 140,000 barrels per day downstream of Guernsey, Wyoming.  Platte deliveries averaged 148,000 barrels per day in 2012.



On December 11, 2012, KMP announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to sell its interests in the Express Pipeline system to Spectra.  This sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2013.



Jet Fuel Pipeline System



KMP also owns and operates the approximate 25-mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the Vancouver International Airport, located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the Jet Fuel pipeline










system.  In addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the Westridge Marine terminal, located in Port Metro Vancouver, the Jet Fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the Vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15,000 barrels.



Competition



Trans Mountain and the Express pipeline system are each one of several pipeline alternatives for western Canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production, and each competes against other pipeline providers.





Other



During 2012, our other segment activities include those operations that were acquired from EP on May 25, 2012 and are primarily related to several physical natural gas contracts with power plants associated with EP’s legacy trading activities. These contracts obligate EP to sell natural gas to these plants and have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2028.  In 2010, this segment primarily consisted of our Power facility which was sold on October 22, 2010. This segment also included an interest in the Bolivia to Brazil Pipeline, which we sold for $88 million on January 18, 2013.







Major Customers

Our total operating revenues are derived from a wide customer base.For each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of Texas, and, to a far lesser extent, the CO2-KMP business segment also sells natural gas.   Combined, total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the Natural Gas Pipelines and CO2-KMP business segments in 2012, 2011 and 2010 accounted for 26%, 42% and 46%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues.  To the extent possible, we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of its natural gas purchases to its natural gas sales, and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales.  We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Regulation

Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation - U.S. Operations

Some of our U.S. refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA.  The ICA requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the FERC.  Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services.  The ICA requires, among other things, that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates.  If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation.  The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively.  Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint.

On October 24, 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  The Energy Policy Act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ICA.  The Energy Policy Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates.  Certain rates on KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365-day period established by the Energy Policy Act.  Accordingly, certain of the Pacific pipelines’ rates have been, and continue to be, the subject of complaints with the FERC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index.  Shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year.  A pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates.  Cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified










circumstances to change rates.

Common Carrier Pipeline Rate Regulation - Canadian Operations

The Canadian portion of KMP’s crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of Canada’s National Energy Board, referred to in this report as the NEB.  The National Energy Board Act gives the NEB power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service.

Trans Mountain Pipeline.Trans Mountain previously had a one-year toll settlement with shippers that expired on December 31, 2012.  In February 2013, Trans Mountain completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement to be effective for 2013.  Trans Mountain anticipates approval from the NEB in thesecond quarter of 2013.  The toll charged for the portion of Trans Mountain’s pipeline system located in the U.S. falls under the jurisdiction of the FERC.  See “-Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation - U.S. Operations.”

Express Pipeline.The Canadian segment of the Express Pipeline is regulated by the NEB as a Group 2 pipeline, which results in rates and terms of service being regulated on a complaint basis only.  Express committed contract rates are subject to a 2% inflation adjustment April 1 of each year.  The U.S. segment of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline are regulated by the FERC.  See “-Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation - U.S. Operations.”  Additionally, movements on the Platte Pipeline within the state of Wyoming are regulated by the Wyoming Public Service Commission, which regulates the tariffs and terms of service of public utilities that operate in the state of Wyoming.  The Wyoming Public Service Commission standards applicable to rates are similar to those of the FERC and the NEB.

Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Regulation

Posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we could charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines.  Within that range, each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition, so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination.  Apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums, the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty, irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariff-based maximum and minimum rate levels.  Negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates.  There are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay, and while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance, the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable.

The FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions of service, construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services, including storage services, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.  To a lesser extent, the FERC regulates interstate transportation rates, terms and conditions of service under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  Beginning in the mid-1980’s, through the mid-1990’s, the FERC initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to create a more competitive environment in the natural gas marketplace. Among the most important of these changes were:

▪Order No. 436 (1985) which required open-access, nondiscriminatory transportation of natural gas;

▪Order No. 497 (1988) which set forth new standards and guidelines imposing certain constraints on the interaction between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates and imposing certain disclosure requirements regarding that interaction; and

▪Order No. 636 (1992) which required interstate natural gas pipelines that perform open-access transportation under blanket certificates to “unbundle” or separate their traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and to provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas supplies.  Natural gas pipelines must now separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide (i.e., for the natural gas commodity, transportation and storage).

The FERC standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues, including (i) the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees; (ii) the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees; (iii) the definition of transmission function information; (iv) independent functioning; (v) transparency; and (vi) the interaction of FERC standards with the North American Energy Standards Board business practice standards. The FERC also promulgates certain standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities.  In light of the changing structure of the energy industry, these standards of conduct govern employee relationships-using a functional approach-to ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis. Pursuant to the FERC’s standards of conduct, a










natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee non-public information about the transmission system or a transmission customer.  Additionally, no-conduit provisions prohibit a transmission function provider from disclosing non-public information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit.

Rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees, marketing function employees, officers, directors, supervisory employees, and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information.

In addition to regulatory changes initiated by the FERC, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act amended the Natural Gas Act to: (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder.



California Public Utilities Commission Rate Regulation

The intrastate common carrier operations of KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipelines in California are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission, referred to in this report as the CPUC, under a “depreciated book plant” methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment.  Intrastate tariffs filed by KMP with the CPUC have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the California intrastate portion of the Pacific operations’ business.  Tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in California are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the CPUC.  A variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the CPUC, and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to KMP’s FERC regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates.  Certain of the Pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been, and continue to be, subject to complaints with the CPUC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Texas Railroad Commission Rate Regulation

The intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in Texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the Texas Railroad Commission.  The Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.

Mexico - Energy Regulating Commission



The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the Energy Regulating Commission (the Commission) on September 30, 2002 and it defines the general and directional conditions for the Company to carry out the activity and provide the natural gas transportation service.  This permit has a term of 30 years.



This permit establishes certain restrictive conditions, including without limitations (i) compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service; (ii) compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official Mexican standards regarding safety; (iii) compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the project presented to the Commission; (iv) compliance with certain technical studies established by the Commission; and (v) compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10% of the investment proposed in the project.



Safety Regulation



We are also subject to safety regulations imposed by the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, referred to as PHMSA, including those requiring us to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas, or HCAs, where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.



The ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict. Changes such as advances of in-line inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in HCAs can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs. We plan to










continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the U.S. Department of Transportation rules. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.





From time to time, our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures. These leaks and ruptures may cause explosions, fire, damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death. In connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines and/or to properly maintain our pipelines. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties.



We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and other comparable federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety.  In general, we believe current expenditures are addressing the OSHA requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees.  Based on new regulatory developments, we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards.  However, such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be estimated at this time.



State and Local Regulation



Our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.





Environmental Matters



Our business operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, pollution and human health and safety in the U.S. and Canada.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, or at or from our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures.  Furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required under federal, state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.



Environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change.  The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment, wildlife, natural resources and human health.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.












In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.  This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed.  We have accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, referred to in this report as the U.S. EPA, or similar state or Canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties.  The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures.



We believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.  We have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of$397 millionas of December 31, 2012.  Our reserve estimates range in value from approximately$397 millionto approximately$529 million, and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range, as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability.  For additional information related to environmental matters, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste



We generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state and Canadian statutes.  From time to time, the U.S. EPA and state and Canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste.  Furthermore, it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations, may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes.  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes.  Such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.



Superfund



The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  CERCLA authorizes the U.S. EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Although petroleum is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance, in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance.  By operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.



Clean Air Act



Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state and Canadian statutes and regulations.  We believe that the operations of our pipelines, storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes.  The U.S. EPA adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act that took effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.   See “Climate Change” below.



Clean Water Act



Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the U.S.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal, state or Canadian authorities.  The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills.  Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state and Canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release.












Climate Change



Studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases.   Various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases, including the EPA programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.





In addition, in 2009 the EPA published a final rule requiring that specified large greenhouse gas emissions sources annually report the greenhouse gas emissions for the preceding year in the U.S., beginning in 2011 for emissions occurring in 2010. In 2010, the EPA published a final rule expanding its existing greenhouse gas emissions reporting rule for petroleum and natural gas facilities, including natural gas transmission compression facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. The rule, which went into effect in December 2010, requires reporting of greenhouse gas emissions by regulated facilities to the EPA by September 2012 for emissions during 2011 and annually thereafter. Some of our facilities are required to report under this rule, and operational and/or regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting requirements.



At the state level, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs. Although many of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that sources such as our gas-fired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to purchase and surrender emission allowances.



Because our and our subsidiaries operations, including the compressor stations and processing plants, emit various types of greenhouse gases, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities. Depending on the particular law, regulation or program, we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new emission controls on the facilities, acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.  We are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us.  While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries pipelines, such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or prospects.





Some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding.  We may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  To the extent these phenomena occur, they could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and










river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone regions.  However, the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and, in any event, these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon.  Thus, we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or U.S. EPA regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil.  In addition, we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within the CO2-KMP business segment.  However, these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.  Although the magnitude and direction of these impacts cannot now be predicted, greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



EPA Regulation of Internal Combustion Engines



Internal combustion engines used in our operations are also subject to EPA regulation under the Clean Air Act. The EPA published new regulations on emissions of hazardous air pollutants from reciprocating internal combustion engines on August 20, 2010. On June 7, 2012, the EPA proposed amendments to these regulations which are expected to be finalized in the near future. The EPA also revised the New Source Performance Standards for stationary compression ignition and spark ignition internal combustion engines on June 28, 2011 and has proposed minor amendments, included in the June 7, 2012 proposed rule. Compliance with these new regulations may require significant capital expenditures for physical modifications and may require operational changes as well. We are not able to estimate such increased costs, however, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant for us.



Recent EPA Rules Regarding Oil and Natural Gas Air Emissions



In addition, on April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final rules that establish new air emission controls for oil and natural gas production, pipelines and processing operations. These rules were published in the Federal Register on August 16, 2012 and became effective on October 15, 2012. For new or reworked hydraulically fractured gas wells, the rules require the control of emissions through flaring or reduced emission (or “green”) completions until 2015, when the rules require the use of green completions. The rules also establish specific new requirements, effective in 2012, for emissions from compressors, dehydrators, storage tanks, gas processing plants and certain other equipment. These rules may therefore require a number of modifications to our and our customers’ operations, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions. In October 2012, several challenges to EPA’s rules were filed by various parties, including environmental groups and industry associations. Depending on the outcome of such proceedings, the rules may be modified or rescinded or EPA may issue new rules, the costs of compliance with any modified or newly issued rules cannot be predicted.



Additionally, on December 11, 2012, seven states submitted a notice of intent to sue the EPA to compel the agency to make a determination as to whether standards of performance limiting methane emissions from oil and gas sources are appropriate, and, if so, to promulgate performance standards for methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, which was not addressed in the EPA rule that became effective on October 15, 2012. The notice of intent also requested EPA issue emission guidelines for the control of methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. Depending on whether rules are promulgated and the applicability and restrictions in any promulgated rule, compliance with such rules could result in additional costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs. While we are not able at this time to estimate such additional costs, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry, they could be significant for us. Compliance with such rules may also make it more difficult for us and our customers to operate, thereby reducing the volume of natural gas transported through our pipelines, which may adversely affect our business.



Department of Homeland Security



In Section 550 of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007, the U.S. Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security, referred to in this report as the DHS, regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical facilities.  Pursuant to its congressional mandate, on April 9, 2007, the DHS promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards.  This process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet DHS-defined, risk based performance standards.  The DHS has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule; therefore, neither the extent to










which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.





Other



Employees



We employed 10,685 full-time people at December 31, 2012, including approximately 818 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2016.  We consider relations with our employees to be good.



Most of our employees are employed by a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units (subsidiaries or limited partnerships).  The direct costs of compensation, benefits expenses, employer taxes and other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries and limited partnerships. Our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services, and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries and limited partnerships pursuant to existing expense allocation procedures.  The effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees, as the case may be, while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs.  These processes are in accordance with limited partnership agreements, and the Delegation of Control Agreement among Kinder Morgan G.P., Inc., KMR, KMP and others, and KMR’s limited liability company.
