Recent Developments



The following is a brief listing of significant developments since December 31, 2010.  We begin with developments pertaining to our reportable business segments.  Additional information regarding most of these items may be found elsewhere in this report.



Products Pipelines—KMP



▪In February 2011, KMP’s subsidiary SFPP, L.P. entered into a settlement agreement with a shipper regarding various interstate transportation rate challenges filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, referred to in this report as the FERC.  In March 2011, KMP made payments of $63.0 million pursuant to this settlement agreement.  Additionally, in September 2011, KMP made refund payments to various intrastate transportation shippers totaling $18.4 million.  During 2011, it recognized a combined $251.8 million increase in expense due to adjustments of its liabilities related to interstate and intrastate transportation rate challenges and certain other litigation matters involving its West Coast Products Pipeline operations;



▪On May 5, 2011, KMP announced an approximately $220 million investment to build a new crude oil/condensate pipeline that will initially transport 50,000 barrels of condensate per day for Petrohawk Energy Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of BHP Billiton) from its production area in the Eagle Ford shale gas formation in South Texas to the Houston Ship Channel.  The pipeline will consist of approximately 70 miles of new pipeline construction and 113 miles of existing natural gas pipeline that will be converted to transport crude oil and condensate.  The pipeline will originate near Cuero, Texas, and extend to the Houston Ship Channel where it will initially deliver condensate to multiple terminaling facilities having access to local refineries, petrochemical plants and loading docks.  KMP began construction on the crude oil/condensate pipeline in December 2011 and it expects to place the pipeline into service during the second quarter of 2012.  When fully complete, the pipeline will have a capacity of approximately 300,000 barrels per day;



▪On September 14, 2011, KMP announced that it will partner with Valero Energy Corporation to build the Parkway





7

Pipeline, a new 136-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline that will transport refined petroleum products from refineries located in Norco, Louisiana, to Plantation Pipe Line Company’s petroleum transportation hub located in Collins, Mississippi.  From this hub, the products will be transported by various products pipeline systems (including Plantation, KMP’s approximately 51%-owned equity investee) that serve major markets in the southeastern United States.  KMP will operate the Parkway Pipeline and its ownership is through its 50% equity interest in Parkway Pipeline LLC, the sole owner of the Parkway Pipeline.  Valero Energy Corporation owns the remaining 50% ownership interest.  Pending receipt of environmental and regulatory approvals, the approximately $220 million pipeline project is expected to be in service by mid-year 2013.  The Parkway Pipeline will have an initial capacity of 110,000 barrels per day, with the ability to expand to over 200,000 barrels per day.  The project is supported by a long-term throughput agreement with a credit-worthy shipper;

▪As of the date of this report, construction continues on KMP’s previously announced refined petroleum products storage expansion project at its West Coast Terminals’ Carson, California products terminal.  The approximately $77 million expansion project will add seven storage tanks with a combined capacity of 560,000 barrels.  In October 2011, KMP completed and placed into service two storage tanks, and expects to place the remaining five tanks into service in late 2012 and early 2013.  KMP has entered into a long-term agreement with a major oil company to lease six of these tanks;



▪As of the date of this report, construction continues on KMP’s West Coast Products Pipelines’ approximately $48 million expansion project at Travis Air Force Base located in Fairfield, California.  As previously announced, KMP is constructing three 150,000 barrel storage tanks that will be used for the transportation and storage of incremental military jet fuel.  Two of the three storage tanks were completed and placed into service in December 2011, and the remaining tank is expected to be put into service in March 2012;



▪As of the date of this report, KMP continues to invest more than $35 million to further expand its renewable fuel handling capabilities at various terminal sites across the United States.  KMP completed biodiesel blending modifications at Plantation’s Collins, Mississippi hub in December 2011.  These modifications allow Plantation to transport blended biodiesel to several of KMP’s existing Southeast terminal facilities.  Additionally, construction continues at KMP’s Port of Tampa terminal related to KMP’s previously announced public-private partnership project with the Tampa Port Authority and CSX Corporation that will bring additional ethanol into the Tampa market via the nations’ first ethanol unit train to pipeline distribution system.  KMP expects this new ethanol hub will be operational by October 2012;



▪On December 14, 2011, KMP announced that it will build, own and operate a petroleum condensate processing facility near its Galena Park liquids terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel.  The processing facility will have an initial throughput of 25,000 barrels per day and will be designed for future expansions that will allow for throughput of up to 100,000 barrels per day.  The facility will split condensate into its various components such as light and heavy naphthas, kerosene and gas oil, and through a fee structure, a major oil industry customer is underwriting the initial throughput of the facility.  KMP’s current estimate of total construction costs on the project is approximately $130.0 million and it expects to complete construction of this facility and commence service in January 2014; and



▪On December 15, 2011, KMP acquired a refined petroleum products terminal located on a 14-acre site in Lorton, Virginia from Motiva Enterprises, LLC for an aggregate consideration of $12.5 million in cash.  The terminal is served exclusively by the Plantation Pipeline and has storage capacity of approximately 450,000 barrels for refined petroleum products like gasoline and jet fuel.



Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP



▪On January 1, 2011, Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC began firm contract pipeline transportation service to customers on its Fayetteville Express natural gas pipeline system, a 187-mile, 42-inch diameter pipeline that provides shippers in the Arkansas Fayetteville shale gas area with takeaway natural gas capacity and further access to growing markets.  KMP owns a 50% interest in Fayetteville Express Pipeline LLC, and Energy Transfer Partners L.P. owns the remaining interest and also operates the Fayetteville Express pipeline system.  Construction of the pipeline system was completed in January 2011, and total costs for the project were slightly less than $1.0 billion (versus the original budget of $1.3 billion);



▪On April 14, 2011, KMP’s subsidiary Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission LLC completed construction and placed into service all remaining capital improvements that expanded its mainline natural gas pipeline facilities that run from Franklin to Hastings, Nebraska.  The pipeline expansion and capital improvements created up to ten





8

million cubic feet per day of natural gas capacity to serve an ethanol plant located near Aurora, Nebraska.  Project construction commenced in October 2009 and total costs for the project were approximately $18.4 million;

▪In May 2011, KMP completed debrining a third underground storage cavern at its North Dayton natural gas storage facility located in Liberty County, Texas.  The completed cavern added approximately seven billion cubic feet of working natural gas storage capacity at the facility, and the development and mining of the cavern was part of an approximately $103 million expansion project at KMP’s North Dayton storage facility;



▪On July 1, 2011, KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group replaced an expiring 10-year services agreement with Calpine Corporation with a new 10-year agreement that extends to July 1, 2021.  Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Texas intrastate group will provide Calpine approximately 300 million cubic feet per day of natural gas transport capacity and four billion cubic feet of natural gas storage capacity.  Calpine will use the service to supply fuel to seven of its electricity generating facilities in the state of Texas;



▪On July 1, 2011, KMP acquired from Petrohawk Energy Corporation both the remaining 50% equity ownership interest in KinderHawk Field Services LLC that it did not already own and a 25% equity ownership interest in EagleHawk Field Services, LLC (Petrohawk’s natural gas gathering and treating business located in the Eagle Ford shale gas formation) for an aggregate consideration of $912.1 million, consisting of $835.1 million in cash and assumed debt of $77.0 million (representing 50% of KinderHawk’s borrowings under its bank credit facility as of July 1, 2011).  KMP then repaid the outstanding $154.0 million of borrowings and following this repayment, KinderHawk had no outstanding debt.



Following KMP’s acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in KinderHawk on July 1, 2011, KMP changed its method of accounting from the equity method to full consolidation, and due to the fact that KMP acquired a controlling financial interest in KinderHawk, KMP remeasured its previous 50% equity investment in KinderHawk to its fair value.  We recognized a $167.2 million non-cash loss as a result of this remeasurement.  The loss amount represents the excess of the carrying value of KMP’s investment ($910.2 million as of July 1, 2011) over its fair value ($743.0 million), and we reported this loss separately within the “Other Income (Expense)” section in our accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2011.  Further information on KMP’s KinderHawk operations is discussed below in “—(c) Narrative Description of Business—Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP—Texas Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Group and Other—KinderHawk Field Services LLC;"



▪



▪On November 30, 2011, KMP acquired a manufacturing complex and certain natural gas treating assets from SouthTex Treaters, Inc. for an aggregate consideration of $178.5 million, consisting of $151.5 million in cash and assumed liabilities of $27.0 million.  SouthTex Treaters, Inc. is a leading manufacturer, designer and fabricator of natural gas treating plants that are used to remove impurities (carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) from natural gas before it is delivered into gathering systems and transmission pipelines to ensure that it meets pipeline quality specifications.  The acquisition complemented and expanded KMP’s existing natural gas treating business.



CO2—KMP



▪On November 17, 2011, KMP announced that it had entered into a purchase and sale agreement with a subsidiary of Enhanced Oil Resources to acquire a carbon dioxide source field and related assets located in Apache County, Arizona, and Catron County, New Mexico, for approximately $30 million in cash.  The acquisition includes all of





9

Enhanced Oil’s rights, title, and interest in the carbon dioxide and helium located in the St. Johns gas unit and the Cottonwood Canyon carbon dioxide unit, and KMP expects that this acquisition will provide it with opportunities to further grow its existing carbon dioxide business.  The transaction closed on January 31, 2012;

▪During 2011, KMP activated 15 additional patterns at its carbon dioxide flood in the Katz oil field located near Knox City, Texas.  The flood is part of the previously announced Eastern Shelf Pipeline project in the eastern Permian Basin area of Texas.  The approximately $230 million project also involved the installation of a 91-mile, 10-inch carbon dioxide distribution pipeline that begins near Snyder, Texas and ends west of Knox City.  KMP began injecting carbon dioxide into the Katz field in December 2010 and currently, it is producing approximately 1,400 barrels of crude oil per day from the Katz field.  The development of the carbon dioxide flood in the Katz field is projected to produce an incremental 25 million barrels of oil over the next 15 to 20 years and will provide a platform for future enhanced oil recovery operations in the region; and



▪On January 18, 2012, KMP announced an approximately $255 million investment to expand the carbon dioxide capacity of its approximately 87%-owned Doe Canyon Deep unit in southwestern Colorado.  The expansion project will include the installation of both primary and booster compression and is expected to increase Doe Canyon’s current production rate from 105 million cubic feet of carbon dioxide per day to 170 million cubic feet per day.  KMP expects to begin construction in the second quarter of 2012, to complete and place in service the primary compression in the fourth quarter of 2013, and complete the booster compression in the second quarter of 2014.  Additionally, KMP plans to drill approximately 19 more wells during the next ten years, with three wells scheduled for completion in 2012.



Terminals—KMP



▪On January 3, 2011 and December 28, 2011, KMP made two separate $50 million preferred equity investments in Watco Companies, LLC, the largest privately held short line railroad company in the United States.  Watco also operates transload/intermodal and mechanical services divisions.  KMP’s investments provide capital to Watco for further expansion of specific projects, and for pending acquisitions, including Watco’s previously announced acquisitions of both a controlling interest in the Wisconsin & Southern Railroad and the assets of Birmingham Southern Railway.  KMP’s investment in Watco provides its customers more access to transportation related services and also offers it the opportunity to share in additional growth opportunities through new projects, such as crude oil unit train operations and incremental business at its terminal storage facilities.  Pursuant to the terms of KMP’s investments, it receives priority, cumulative cash distributions from the preferred shares at a rate of 3.25% per quarter, and it participates partially in additional profit distributions at a rate equal to 0.5%.  The preferred shares have no conversion features and hold no voting powers, but do provide KMP certain approval rights, including the right to appoint one of the members to Watco’s Board of Managers.  As of December 31, 2011, KMP’s net equity investment totaled $101.7 million;



▪In January 2011, KMP completed construction of an approximately $16.2 million railcar loop track at its Deepwater petroleum coke terminal facility located in Pasadena, Texas.  The track is used to transport a major petroleum coke producer’s volumes to the facility;



▪On February 17, 2011, KMP’s subsidiary Kinder Morgan Cushing LLC, Deeprock Energy Resources, LLC and Mecuria Energy Trading, Inc., entered into formal agreements for a crude oil storage joint venture located in Cushing, Oklahoma.  On this date, KMP contributed $15.9 million for a 50% ownership interest in the Deeprock North, LLC joint venture, which operated an existing crude oil tank farm that had storage capacity of one million barrels.  During 2011, KMP contributed an additional $7.7 million for its proportionate share of costs related to the construction of three new storage tanks that provide for incremental storage capacity of 750,000 barrels.  The new tanks were completed and placed in service during the fourth quarter of 2011.  Deeprock Energy operates and owns a 12.02% member interest in the joint venture, and Mecuria owns the remaining 37.98% member interest and is the anchor tenant for the joint venture’s crude oil capacity for the next five years with an option to extend.  As of December 31, 2011, KMP’s net equity investment in Deeprock North, LLC totaled $24.0 million;



▪On February 24, 2011 and October 3, 2011, respectively, in order to capitalize on increasing demand for both coal export activity and domestic coal use, KMP entered into two separate agreements to expand its coal terminal operations at its International Marine Terminals facility (IMT), a multi-product, import-export facility located in Port Sulphur, Louisiana and owned 66 2/3% by KMP.  In February 2011, KMP entered into a 15-year services agreement with Massey Coal, a division of Alpha Natural Resources, to handle up to six million tons of coal annually.  The majority of the coal that will pass through IMT will originate from Massey’s Central Appalachia mines, be transported to IMT by river barges, and then offloaded and stored before being loaded onto ocean vessels





10

for export to foreign markets.  KMP anticipates a minimum throughput tonnage increase of four million tons per year related to this agreement.  Secondly, in October 2011, KMP entered into a long-term agreement with Progress Energy Florida to handle up to four million tons of coal per year at IMT.  This agreement will commence in early 2013, and provides Progress Energy with options to extend the agreement for up to 20 years.  Together, KMP and the remaining one-third partner at IMT are investing approximately $114 million to expand and upgrade the facility to enable it to handle the incremental coal volumes related to these two agreements.  The terminal upgrades are expected to be completed by mid-2013;

▪In March 2011, KMP completed construction of its previously announced Deer Park Rail Terminal (DPRT) and related ethanol handling assets at its Pasadena, Texas terminal located along the Houston Ship Channel.  The approximately $19 million project included building a new ethanol unit train facility with space for multiple unit trains, an offloading rail rack for unit trains of approximately 100 railcars, and an 80,000 barrel ethanol storage tank.  As part of the expansion, an existing pipeline was extended by approximately 2.4 miles so that ethanol can be moved from DPRT to KMP’s nearby Pasadena liquids terminal for either storage or blending at the terminal’s truck rack.  The project is supported by long-term customer contracts;



▪In March 2011, KMP entered into an agreement with a large western coal producer to handle up to 2.2 million tons of Colorado coal annually at its Houston, Texas bulk terminal facility located on the Houston Ship Channel.  Unit trains will transport bituminous coal from Colorado mines to KMP’s Houston bulk facility, where the coal will be offloaded and stored before being loaded onto ocean vessels.  KMP also announced an approximately $18 million investment to increase the facility’s coal handling capability by adding rail and conveying equipment, and outbound equipment needed to load coal onto ships.  This facility began handling coal for this new contract in July 2011, marking the first time that western coal was exported from the Port of Houston;



▪On June 10, 2011, KMP acquired a newly constructed petroleum coke terminal located in Port Arthur, Texas from TGS Development, L.P. (TGSD) for an aggregate consideration of $74.1 million, consisting of $42.9 million in cash, $23.7 million in common units, and an obligation to pay additional consideration of $7.5 million.  KMP estimates its remaining $7.5 million obligation will be paid to TGSD approximately one year from the closing (in May or June 2012), and will be settled in a combination of cash and common units, depending on TGSD’s election.  KMP operates the terminal, which receives petroleum coke from Total Petrochemicals USA Inc.’s Port Arthur refinery, and it provides conveying, storage and ship loading services to Total pursuant to a 25-year services agreement.  The refinery is expected to produce more than one million tons of petroleum coke annually;



▪On July 20, 2011, KMP announced an incremental $8.3 million investment at its DPRT (described above) which will add additional ethanol handling and storage capabilities.  The expansion includes building a second 80,000 barrel storage tank and related facilities.  The project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2012;



▪In September 2011, KMP completed an approximately $14 million expansion of its Philadelphia, Pennsylvania liquids terminal to provide storage and handling services to accommodate a large chemical company.  The project involved upgrading existing tank and pipeline systems and installing a new marine flare unit.  The project is secured with a five-year customer agreement;



▪In September 2011, KMP completed an approximately $62 million expansion of its Carteret, New Jersey liquids terminal that added 1.04 million barrels of new petroleum storage tank capacity.  In July 2009, KMP entered into an agreement with a major oil company for this additional capacity.  The project involved the construction of seven new blending tanks, consisting of three 125,000 barrel tanks and four 165,000 barrel storage tanks.  All of the tanks can be used for gasoline blending, and some have built-in flexibility for either ethanol or distillate service;



▪On November 8, 2011, KMP announced its equity participation in Battleground Oil Specialty Terminal Company LLC (BOSTCO), and paid a combined $12.0 million to acquire its initial 50% Class A member interest (consisting of $11.6 million paid in October 2011 and $0.4 million of pre-development costs incurred and paid for during 2010).  On December 29, 2011, KMP acquired the remaining 50% Class A member interest in BOSTCO that it did not already own from TransMontaigne Partners, L.P. for an aggregate consideration of $8.1 million in cash (net of an acquired cash balance of $9.9 million).  TransMontaigne also received an option to buy 50% of KMP’s ownership interest at any time prior to January 20, 2013; however, KMP is currently unable to predict whether it will exercise this purchase option.

BOSTCO will construct, own and operate an approximately $430 million oil terminal located on the Houston Ship Channel.  Phase I of the project includes the design and construction of 52 tanks with combined storage capacity of approximately 6.6 million barrels for handling residual fuel, feedstocks, distillates and other black oils.  BOSTCO

will initially be a water-in, water-out facility with the capability of handling ships with large drafts up to 45 feet, and KMP has executed terminal service contracts or letters of intent with customers for almost all of the Phase I storage capacity;



▪On November 30, 2011, KMP announced an approximately $212 million investment to construct seven tanks with a storage capacity of approximately 2.4 million barrels for crude oil and condensate at its Trans Mountain pipeline terminal located near Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.  KMP has entered into long-term contracts with customers to support this expansion, which will set the framework for two additional phases that will ultimately allow for up to six million barrels of dedicated storage.  Previously, KMP received National Energy Board (Canada) approval to construct merchant and regulated tanks at its Edmonton terminal, and intends to commence construction in early 2012 following receipt of other supporting permits.  The new tanks are anticipated to be placed in service in late 2013;



▪On January 18, 2012, KMP announced that it had entered into a long-term agreement with a major Canadian oil producer to support an approximately $8.5 million expansion of pipeline feeder connections into the Kinder Morgan North 40 terminal, a crude oil tank farm located in Strathcona County, just east of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada; and



▪On January 24, 2012, KMP announced plans to invest an additional $140 million to further expand its coal handling export facilities along the Gulf Coast.  Concurrently, Arch Coal Company signed a long-term throughput agreement with KMP that will help support this expansion, which is anticipated to be completed in the second quarter of 2014.  Upon completion of the proposed terminal upgrades, and subject to certain rail service agreements, Arch will ship coal at guaranteed minimum volume levels through KMP owned terminal facilities.  In addition, KMP and Arch are in final discussions to include, in the throughput agreement, port space for coal shipments at KMP’s coal export facilities located on the East Coast and at KMP’s IMT facility, which when combined with KMP’s Gulf Coast expansions, will provide incremental port capacity for Arch’s growing seaborne coal volumes.  KMP is also extending certain existing long-term coal handling agreements with Arch at its coal facilities located in the state of Illinois.



Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP



▪On February 21, 2012, KMP announced that the commitments it received from its recent Kinder Morgan Canada’s public open season supports moving forward with its proposed Trans Mountain pipeline system expansion.  Originating in Edmonton, Alberta, the Trans Mountain system is currently designed to carry up to 300,000 barrels per day of crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the northwest United States and on the west coast of British Columbia.  Based on shipper response, KMP would construct a twin pipeline that could boost system capacity to over 600,000 barrels per day.  The current estimate of total construction costs on the project is approximately $3.8 billion.



Financings—KMP



▪On March 4, 2011, KMP issued a total of $1.1 billion in principal amount of senior notes in two separate series, consisting of $500 million of 3.50% notes due March 1, 2016, and $600 million of 6.375% notes due March 1, 2041.  The net proceeds received from this debt offering were used to reduce the borrowings under KMP’s commercial paper program;



▪On March 15, 2011, KMP paid $700 million to retire the principal amount of its 6.75% senior notes that matured on that date;



▪On July 1, 2011, KMP amended its $2.0 billion three-year, senior unsecured revolving credit facility to, among other things, (i) allow for borrowings of up to $2.2 billion; (ii) extend the maturity of the credit facility from June 23, 2013 to July 1, 2016; (iii) permit an amendment to allow for borrowings of up to $2.5 billion; and (iv) decrease the interest rates and commitment fees for borrowings under this facility.  The credit facility is with a syndicate of financial institutions, and the facility permits KMP to obtain bids for fixed rate loans from members of the lending syndicate.  Wells Fargo Bank, National Association is the administrative agent, and borrowings under the credit facility can be used for general partnership purposes and as a backup for KMP’s $2.2 billion commercial paper program;



▪On August 17, 2011, KMP issued a total of $750 million in principal amount of senior notes in two separate series, consisting of $375 million of 4.15% notes due March 1, 2022, and $375 million of 5.625% notes due September 1,





12



2041.  The net proceeds received from this debt offering were used to reduce the borrowings under KMP’s commercial paper program;

▪In August 2011, KMP terminated two existing fixed-to-variable interest rate swap agreements in two separate transactions.  These swap agreements had a combined notional principal amount of $200 million, and KMP received combined proceeds of $73.0 million from the early termination of these swap agreements; and



▪In 2011, KMP issued 13,469,708 common units for $955.3 million in cash, described following.  The net proceeds received from the issuance of these common units were used to reduce the borrowings under KMP’s commercial paper program:



In June 2011, KMP completed a public offering of 7,705,000 of its common units at a price of $71.44 per unit.  After commissions and underwriting expenses, net proceeds of $533.9 million were received for the issuance of these common units; and



During 2011, KMP issued 5,764,708 of its common units pursuant to its equity distribution agreement with UBS Securities LLC.  After commissions, net proceeds of $421.4 million were received from the issuance of these common units.



2012 Outlook—KMP



▪As KMP previously announced, it anticipates that for the year 2012, (i) it will declare cash distributions of $4.98 per unit, an 8% increase over its cash distributions of $4.61 per unit for 2011; (ii) its business segments will generate approximately $4.4 billion in earnings before all non-cash depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses, including amortization of excess cost of equity investments and its share of all non-cash depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses of certain joint ventures accounted for under the equity-method of accounting; (iii) it will distribute approximately $1.7 billon to its limited partners; (iv) it will produce excess cash flow of $71.0 million above its cash distribution target of $4.98 per unit; and (v) it will invest approximately $1.7 billion for its capital expansion program (including small acquisitions and contributions to joint ventures).  KMP’s anticipated 2012 expansion investment will help drive earnings and cash flow growth in 2012 and beyond, and KMP estimates that approximately $490 million of the equity required for its 2012 investment program will be funded by cash retained as a function of KMR distributions being paid in additional units rather than in cash.  In 2011, KMP’s capital expansion program was approximately $2.6 billion—including discretionary capital spending, equity contributions to its equity investees, and acquisition cash expenditures.



KMP’s expectations assume an average West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil price of approximately $93.75 per barrel in 2012.  Although the majority of the cash generated by KMP’s assets is fee based and is not sensitive to commodity prices, the CO2–KMP business segment is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of crude oil and natural gas liquids.  KMP hedges the majority of its crude oil production, but does have exposure to unhedged volumes, the majority of which are natural gas liquids volumes.  For 2012, KMP expects that every $1 change in the average WTI crude oil price per barrel will impact the CO2—KMPsegment’s cash flows by approximately $5.8 million (or slightly over 0.1% of KMP’s combined business segments’ anticipated earnings before depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses).



Recent Developments and Outlook—KMI



▪On January 5, 2011, we paid $750 million to retire the principal amount of our 5.35% senior notes that matured on that date;

▪On October 16, 2011, as discussed above, we and EP announced a definitive agreement whereby we will acquire





13

all of the outstanding shares of EP.  See Note 3¾“Acquisitions and Divestitures¾Pending Acquisition of El Paso Corporation” to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



(b) Financial Information about Segments



For financial information on our six reportable business segments, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



(c) Narrative Description of Business



Business Strategy



Our business strategy is to:



▪focus on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure of growing markets within North America;



▪increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and employing environmentally sound operating practices;



▪leverage economies of scale from incremental acquisitions and expansions of assets that fit within our strategy and are accretive to cash flow; and



▪maximize the benefits of our financial structure to create and return value to our stockholders.



It is our intention to carry out the above business strategy, modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances.  However, as discussed under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below, there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out.



We (primarily through KMP) regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions.  Any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions, receipt of fairness opinions and approval of the parties’ respective boards of directors.  While there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets, such transactions can be effected quickly, may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations.

KMP’s Products Pipelines’ terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators, and its transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities.



Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP



The Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP business segment contains both interstate and intrastate pipelines.  Its primary businesses consist of natural gas sales, transportation, storage, gathering, processing and treating.  Within this segment, KMP owns approximately 16,200 miles of natural gas pipelines and associated storage and supply lines that are strategically located at the center of the North American pipeline grid.  KMP’s transportation network provides access to the major gas supply areas in the western United States, Texas and the Midwest, as well as major consumer markets.



Texas Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Group and Other



Texas Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Group



The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group, which operates primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast, consists of the following four natural gas pipeline systems: (i) Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline; (ii) Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline; (iii) Mier-Monterrey Mexico Pipeline; and (iv) Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline.



The two largest systems in the group are the Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline and the Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline.  These pipelines essentially operate as a single pipeline system, providing customers and suppliers with improved flexibility and reliability.  The combined system includes approximately 6,000 miles of intrastate natural gas pipelines with a peak transport and sales capacity of approximately 5.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and approximately 144 billion cubic feet of on-system natural gas storage capacity, including 11 billion cubic feet contracted from a third party (which will be reduced to 5 billion cubic feet in April 2012).  In addition, the combined system (i) has facilities to both treat approximately 180 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide removal, and to process approximately 65 million cubic feet per day of natural gas for liquids extraction and (ii) holds contractual rights to process natural gas at certain third party facilities.



The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline consists of a 95-mile natural gas pipeline that stretches from the international border between the United States and Mexico in Starr County, Texas, to Monterrey, Mexico and can transport up to 375 million cubic feet per day.  The pipeline connects to a 1,000-megawatt power plant complex and to the Pemex natural gas transportation system.  The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline has entered into a long-term contract (expiring in 2018) with Pemex, which has subscribed for all of the pipeline’s capacity.



The Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline consists of an 82-mile pipeline that transports natural gas from an interconnect with the facilities of Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America LLC (a 20%-owned equity investee of KMI and referred to in this report as NGPL) in Lamar County, Texas to a 1,750-megawatt electricity generating facility located in Forney, Texas, 15 miles east of Dallas, Texas.  It has the capacity to transport 325 million cubic feet per day of natural gas and is fully subscribed under a long-term contract that expires in 2032.  The system is bi-directional, permitting deliveries of additional supply from the Barnett Shale area to NGPL’s pipeline as well as power plants in the area.





17

Texas is one of the largest natural gas consuming states in the country.  The natural gas demand profile in the Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group’s market area is primarily composed of industrial (including on-site cogeneration facilities), merchant and utility power, and local natural gas distribution consumption.  The industrial demand is primarily year-round load.  Merchant and utility power demand peaks in the summer months and is complemented by local natural gas distribution demand that peaks in the winter months.



Collectively, the Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system primarily serves the Texas Gulf Coast by selling, transporting, processing and treating natural gas from multiple onshore and offshore supply sources to serve the Houston/Beaumont/Port Arthur/Austin industrial markets, local natural gas distribution utilities, electric utilities and merchant power generation markets.  It serves as a buyer and seller of natural gas, as well as a transporter of natural gas.  In 2011, the four natural gas pipeline systems in the Texas intrastate group provided an average of approximately 2.23 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas transport services.  The Texas intrastate group also sold approximately 804.7 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2011.



The purchases and sales of natural gas are primarily priced with reference to market prices in the consuming region of the system.  The difference between the purchase and sale prices is the rough equivalent of a transportation fee and fuel costs.  Generally, KMP purchases natural gas directly from producers with reserves connected to its intrastate natural gas system in South Texas, East Texas, West Texas, and along the Texas Gulf Coast.  In addition, the Texas intrastate group also purchases gas at interconnects with third-party interstate and intrastate pipelines.  While the Texas intrastate group does not produce gas, it does maintain an active well connection program in order to offset natural declines in production along its system and to secure supplies for additional demand in its market area.  The Texas intrastate system has access to both onshore and offshore sources of supply, and is well positioned to interconnect with liquefied natural gas projects currently under development by others along the Texas Gulf Coast.  The Texas intrastate group also has access to markets within and outside of Texas through interconnections with numerous interstate natural gas pipelines.



Kinder Morgan Treating L.P.



KMP’s subsidiary, Kinder Morgan Treating, L.P., owns and operates (or leases to producers for operation) treating plants that remove impurities (such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide) and hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas before it is delivered into gathering systems and transmission pipelines to ensure that it meets pipeline quality specifications.

Competition



The market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive, and new pipelines are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP business segment.  These operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines, and their shippers, for attachments to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services.  KMP believes the principal elements of competition in its various markets are transportation rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service.  From time to time, other pipeline projects are proposed that would compete with KMP’s pipelines, and some proposed pipelines may deliver natural gas to markets it serves from new supply sources closer to those markets.  KMP does not know whether or when any such projects would be built, or the extent of their impact on its operations or profitability.



Shippers on KMP’s natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils.  Several factors influence the demand for natural gas, including price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather.



CO2—KMP



The CO2—KMP business segment consists of Kinder Morgan CO2Company, L.P. and its consolidated affiliates, collectively referred to in this report as KMCO2.  The CO2—KMP business segment produces, transports, and markets carbon dioxide for use in enhanced oil recovery projects as a flooding medium for recovering crude oil from mature oil fields.  KMCO2’s carbon dioxide pipelines and related assets allow it to market a complete package of carbon dioxide supply, transportation and technical expertise to its customers.  KMCO2also holds ownership interests in several oil-producing fields and owns a crude oil pipeline, all located in the Permian Basin region of West Texas.

KMP’s liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals, and terminals owned by oil, chemical and pipeline companies.  KMP’s bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators, terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities, stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminal services.  In some locations, KMP’s competitors are smaller, independent operators with lower cost structures.  KMP’s rail transloading (material services) operations compete with a variety of single- or multi-site transload, warehouse and terminal operators across the United States.  KMP’s ethanol rail transload operations compete with a variety of ethanol handling terminal sites across the United States, many offering waterborne service, truck loading, and unit train capability serviced by Class 1 rail carriers.



Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP



The Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP business segment includes the Trans Mountain pipeline system, KMP’s ownership of a one-third interest in the Express pipeline system, and the 25-mile Jet Fuel pipeline system.  The weighted average remaining life of the shipping contracts on these pipeline systems was approximately two years as of December 31, 2011.



Trans Mountain Pipeline System



The Trans Mountain pipeline system originates at Edmonton, Alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of British Columbia.  Trans Mountain’s pipeline is 715 miles in length. KMP also owns a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of Washington.  The capacity of the line at Edmonton ranges from 300,000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents 20% of the total throughput (which is a historically normal heavy crude percentage), to 400,000 barrels per day with no heavy crude.  Trans Mountain is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from Alberta to the west coast.  KMP believes these facilities provide it the opportunity to consider capacity expansions to the west coast, either in stages or as one project, as the market for offshore exports continues to develop.



In 2011, Trans Mountain delivered an average of 274,000 barrels per day.  The crude oil and refined petroleum products transported through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system originates in Alberta and British Columbia.  The refined and partially refined petroleum products transported to Kamloops, British Columbia and Vancouver originates from oil refineries located in Edmonton.  Petroleum products delivered through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system are used in markets in British Columbia, Washington State and elsewhere offshore.



Trans Mountain also operates a 5.3 mile spur line from its Sumas Pump Station to the U.S. – Canada international border where it connects with KMP’s approximate 63-mile, 16-inch to 20-inch diameter Puget Sound pipeline system.  The Puget Sound pipeline system in the state of Washington has a sustainable throughput capacity of approximately 135,000 barrels per day when heavy crude represents approximately 25% of throughput, and it connects to four refineries located in northwestern Washington State.  The volumes of crude oil shipped to the state of Washington fluctuate in response to the price levels of Canadian crude oil in relation to crude oil produced in Alaska and other offshore sources.



In January 2012, Trans Mountain completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement effective for the period beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2012.  Trans Mountain anticipates National Energy Board approval in the second quarter of 2012.

Major Customers



Our total operating revenues are derived from a wide customer base.For each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues.  KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of Texas, and, to a far lesser extent, the CO2—KMP business segment also sells natural gas.  Combined, total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP and CO2—KMP business segments in 2011, 2010 and 2009 accounted for 40.4%, 44.1% and 43.7%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues.  To the extent possible, KMP attempts to balance the pricing and timing of its natural gas purchases to its natural gas sales, and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales.  We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Regulation



Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations



Some of our U.S. refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA.  The ICA requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the FERC.  Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services.  The ICA requires, among other things, that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates.  If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation.  The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively.  Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint.



On October 24, 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  The Energy Policy Act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ICA.  The Energy Policy Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates.  Certain rates on KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365-day period established by the Energy Policy Act.  Accordingly, certain of the Pacific pipelines’ rates have been, and continue to be, the subject of complaints with the FERC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



Petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index.  Shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year.  A pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates.  Cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates.



Common Carrier Pipeline Rate Regulation – Canadian Operations



The Canadian portion of KMP’s crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of Canada’s National Energy Board, referred to in this report as the NEB.  The National Energy Board Act gives the NEB power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service.



Trans Mountain Pipeline.KMP’s subsidiary, Trans Mountain Pipeline, L.P., previously had a one-year toll settlement with shippers that expired on December 31, 2011.  In January 2012, Trans Mountain Pipeline completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement for KMP’s Trans Mountain Pipeline to be effective for 2012.  Trans Mountain anticipates approval from the NEB in the second quarter of 2012.  The toll charged for the portion of Trans Mountain’s pipeline system located in the United States falls under the jurisdiction of the FERC.  See “—Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations.”



Express Pipeline.The Canadian segment of the Express Pipeline is regulated by the NEB as a Group 2 pipeline, which results in rates and terms of service being regulated on a complaint basis only.  Express committed contract rates are subject to a 2% inflation adjustment April 1 of each year.  The U.S. segment of the Express Pipeline and the Platte Pipeline are regulated by the FERC.  See “—Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation – U.S. Operations.”  Additionally, movements on the Platte Pipeline within the state of Wyoming are regulated by the Wyoming Public Service Commission, which regulates the tariffs and terms of service of public utilities that operate in the state of Wyoming.  The Wyoming Public Service Commission standards applicable to rates are similar to those of the FERC and the NEB.



Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Regulation



Posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines.  Within that range, each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition, so long as





28such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination.  Apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums, the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty, irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariff-based maximum and minimum rate levels.  Negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates.  There are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay, and while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance, the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable.



The FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions of service, construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services, including storage services, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.  To a lesser extent, the FERC regulates interstate transportation rates, terms and conditions of service under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.Beginning in the mid-1980’s, through the mid-1990’s, the FERC initiated a number of regulatory changes intended to create a more competitive environment in the natural gas marketplace. Among the most important of these changes were:



▪Order No. 436 (1985) which required open-access, nondiscriminatory transportation of natural gas;



▪Order No. 497 (1988) which set forth new standards and guidelines imposing certain constraints on the interaction between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates and imposing certain disclosure requirements regarding that interaction; and



▪Order No. 636 (1992) which required interstate natural gas pipelines that perform open-access transportation under blanket certificates to “unbundle” or separate their traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and to provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas supplies.  Natural gas pipelines must now separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide (i.e., for the natural gas commodity, transportation and storage).



The FERC also promulgates certain standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities.  In light of the changing structure of the energy industry, these standards of conduct govern employee relationships—using a functional approach—to ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Pursuant to the FERC’s standards of conduct, a natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee non-public information about the transmission system or a transmission customer.  Additionally, no-conduit provisions prohibit a transmission function provider from disclosing non-public information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit.



The FERC standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues, including (i) the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees; (ii) the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees; (iii) the definition of transmission function information; (iv) independent functioning; (v) transparency; and (vi) the interaction of FERC standards with the North American Energy Standards Board business practice standards.  Rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees, marketing function employees, officers, directors, supervisory employees, and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information.



In addition to regulatory changes initiated by the FERC, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act amended the Natural Gas Act to: (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder.



California Public Utilities Commission Rate Regulation



The intrastate common carrier operations of KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipelines in California are subject to regulation by the California Public Utilities Commission, referred to in this report as the CPUC, under a “depreciated book plant” methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment.  Intrastate tariffs filed by KMP with the CPUC have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the California intrastate portion of the Pacific operations’ business.  Tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in California are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the CPUC.  A variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the CPUC, and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to KMP’s FERC regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates.  Certain of the Pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been, and continue to be, subject to complaints with the CPUC, as is more fully described in Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.

Texas Railroad Commission Rate Regulation



The intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in Texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the Texas Railroad Commission.  The Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.



Safety Regulation



Our interstate pipelines are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation, referred to in this report as the U.S. DOT, and our intrastate pipelines and other operations are subject to comparable state regulations with respect to their design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management.  Comparable regulation exists in some states in which we conduct pipeline operations.  In addition, our truck and terminal loading facilities are subject to U.S. DOT regulations dealing with the transportation of hazardous materials by motor vehicles and railcars.



On September 15, 2010, the secretary of the U.S. DOT sent to the U.S. Congress proposed legislation to provide stronger oversight of the nation’s pipelines and to increase the penalties for violations of pipeline safety rules.  The proposed legislation entitled “Strengthening Pipeline Safety and Enforcement Act of 2010,” would, among other things, increase the maximum fine for the most serious violations from $1 million to $2.5 million, provide additional resources for the enforcement program, require a review of whether safety requirements for “high consequence areas” should be applied instead to entire pipelines, eliminate exemptions and ensure standards are in place for bio-fuel and carbon dioxide pipelines.



The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 provides guidelines in the areas of testing, education, training and communication.  The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act requires pipeline companies to perform integrity tests on natural gas transmission pipelines that exist in high population density areas that are designated as “high consequence areas.”  Testing consists of hydrostatic testing, internal magnetic flux or ultrasonic testing, or direct assessment of the piping.  In addition to the pipeline integrity tests, pipeline companies must implement a qualification program to make certain that employees are properly trained.  A similar integrity management rule exists for refined petroleum products pipelines.



We are also subject to the requirements of the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and other comparable federal and state statutes that address employee health and safety.  In general, we expect to increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards; however, such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be accurately estimated at this time.



State and Local Regulation



Our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.



Environmental Matters



Our business operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, pollution and human health and safety in the United States and Canada.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, or at or from our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures.  Furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required under federal, state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.



Environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change.  The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment, wildlife, natural resources and human health.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be





30different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



In accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.  This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed.  We have accrued liabilities for probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multiparty sites where the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, referred to in this report as the U.S. EPA, or similar state or Canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties.  The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multiparty sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures.



We believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.  We have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of $79.7 million as of December 31, 2011.  Our reserve estimates range in value from approximately $79.7 million to approximately $134.7 million, and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range, as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability.  For additional information related to environmental matters, see Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.



Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste



We generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state and Canadian statutes.  From time to time, the U.S. EPA and state and Canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non-hazardous waste.  Furthermore, it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations, may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes.  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes.  Such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.



Superfund



The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known as CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  CERCLA authorizes the U.S. EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Although petroleum is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance, in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance.  By operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.



Clean Air Act



Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state and Canadian statutes and regulations.  We believe that the operations of our pipelines, storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes.  The U.S. EPA adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act that took effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.  These regulations contain lengthy, complex provisions that may result in the imposition over the next several years of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from the operations of our pipelines, treating and processing facilities, storage facilities, terminals and wells.  Depending on the nature of those requirements and any additional requirements that may be imposed by state and local regulatory authorities, we may be required to incur capital and operating expenditures over the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining operating permits and approvals and addressing other air emission-related issues.  At this time, we are unable to fully estimate the effect on earnings or operations or the amount and timing of such required capital





31expenditures; however, we do not believe that we will be materially adversely affected by any such requirements.



Clean Water Act



Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters or waters of the United States.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal, state or Canadian authorities.  The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills.  Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state and Canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release.



Climate Change



Studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases.  It is not possible at this time to predict what action, if any, the U.S. Congress may take in regard to greenhouse gas legislation.



As discussed above under “—Clean Air Act,” the U.S. EPA adopted new regulations under the Clean Air Act that took effect in early 2011 and that establish requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.  These regulations include the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States from specified large greenhouse gas emission sources, fractionated natural gas liquids, and the production of naturally occurring carbon dioxide, like KMP’s McElmo Dome carbon dioxide field, even when such production is not emitted to the atmosphere.



Because KMP’s operations, including the compressor stations and gas processing plants in the Natural Gas Pipelines—KMP business segment, emit various types of greenhouse gases, primarily methane and carbon dioxide, such legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities and require us to install new emission controls on the facilities, acquire allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.  KMP is not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, they could be significant.  While KMP may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by its natural gas pipelines, such recovery of costs is uncertain in all cases and may depend on events beyond its control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding.  We may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  To the extent these phenomena occur, they could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone regions.  However, the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and, in any event, these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon.  Thus, we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or U.S. EPA regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil.  In addition, we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within the CO2—KMP business segment.  However, these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.  Although the magnitude and direction of these impacts cannot now be predicted, greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Department of Homeland Security



In Section 550 of the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007, the U.S. Congress gave the Department of Homeland Security, referred to in this report as the DHS, regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical





32facilities.  Pursuant to its congressional mandate, on April 9, 2007, the DHS promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards.  This process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet DHS-defined, risk based performance standards.  The DHS has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule; therefore, neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.



Other



Employees



We employed 8,120 full-time people at December 31, 2011, including employees of our indirect subsidiary KMGP Services Company, Inc., who are dedicated to the operations of KMP, and employees of Kinder Morgan Canada Inc.  Approximately 833 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines are represented by labor unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2012 and 2016.  We, KMGP Services Company, Inc., and Kinder Morgan Canada Inc. each consider relations with our employees to be good.  For more information on our related party transactions, see Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.





Our named executive officers and other employees that provide management or services to us and the Group are employed by us.  Additionally, other of our employees assist KMP in the operation of its Natural Gas Pipeline assets.  These employees’ expenses are allocated without a profit component between us and the appropriate members of the Group.
