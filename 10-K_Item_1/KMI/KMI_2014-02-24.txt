(a) General Development of Business





Organizational Structure



On February 10, 2011, we converted from a Delaware LLC named Kinder Morgan Holdco LLC to a Delaware corporation named Kinder Morgan, Inc. and our outstanding units were converted into classes of our capital stock.  These transactions are referred to herein as the “Conversion Transaction.”  On February 16, 2011, we completed the initial public offering of our Class P common stock, which is sometimes referred to herein as our “common stock.” All of the common stock that was sold in the offering was sold by our existing investors consisting of funds advised by or affiliated with Goldman Sachs & Co., Highstar Capital LP, The Carlyle Group and Riverstone Holdings LLC, referred to herein as the “Sponsor Investors.”  No members of management sold shares in the offering, and we did not receive any proceeds from the offering.



Upon the completion of our initial public offering of Class P common stock we were owned by the public, and by individuals and entities that were the owners of Kinder Morgan Holdco LLC, which are referred to collectively in this report as the “Investors.”  The Investors were Richard D. Kinder, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; the Sponsor Investors; Fayez Sarofim, one of our directors, and investment entities affiliated with him, and an investment entity affiliated with Michael C. Morgan, another of our directors, and William V. Morgan, one of our founders, whom we refer to collectively as the “Original Stockholders”; and a number of other members of our management, who are referred to collectively as “Other Management.”



The Investors owned all of our outstanding Class A shares, Class B shares and Class C shares, which are sometimes referred to in this report as the “investor retained stock.”  Our Class A shares represented the total capital contributed by the Investors (and a notional amount of capital allocated to the contribution of the holders of the Class C shares) at the time of the Going Private Transaction. The Class B shares and Class C shares represented incentive compensation that were held by members of our management, including Mr. Kinder only in the case of the Class B shares.



During the year ended December 31, 2012, certain of the Sponsor Investors (the Selling Stockholders) completed underwritten public offerings (the Offerings) of an aggregate of198,996,921 sharesof our Class P common stock (including 8,700,000 shares that were the subject of an underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares). Neither we nor our management sold any shares of common stock in the Offerings, and we did not receive any of the proceeds from the offerings of shares by the Selling Stockholders. As a result of these offerings, the Sponsor Investors advised by or affiliated with Goldman Sachs & Co., The Carlyle Group, and Riverstone Holdings LLC no longer own any of our shares, and representatives of these Sponsor Investors are no longer on our board.



On December 26, 2012, the remaining series of the Class A, Class B and Class C shares held by the Investors automatically converted into shares of Class P common stock upon the election of the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of each such series of Class A common stock and the holders of at least two-thirds of the shares of each such series of Class B common stock. Subsequent to these conversions, all our Class A, Class B and Class C shares were fully converted and as a result, only our Class P common stock was outstanding as of December 31, 2012.   Additionally, as Class A, Class B and Class C shares converted, certain holders of the Class P shares were paid out in cash and their Class P shares were immediately canceled. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, approximately2 millionand less than1 million, respectively, Class P shares were canceled resulting in payments totaling approximately$71 millionand$2 million, respectively, to the holders of those shares.










We conduct most of our business through our MLPs (KMP and EPB).  KMP is a Delaware limited partnership formed in August 1992. KMR is a Delaware LLC formed in February 2001. KMP’s general partner, KMGP, owns all of KMR’s voting securities.

Recent Developments

The following is a brief listing of significant developments since December 31, 2012.  We begin with developments pertaining to our reportable business segments.  Additional information regarding most of these items may be found elsewhere in this report.

Natural Gas Pipelines



KMP



•On March 1, 2013, KMP acquired from us both the remaining 50% ownership interest KMP did not already own in EPNG and the remaining 50% ownership interest it did not already own in the EP midstream assets for an aggregate consideration of approximately $1.7 billion, consisting of cash paid, common units issued and debt assumed.  In this report, we refer to this acquisition of assets from us as the March 2013 drop-down transaction; the combined group of assets acquired from us effective March 1, 2013 as the March 2013 drop-down asset group; and the EP midstream assets or Kinder Morgan Altamont LLC (formerly, El Paso Midstream Investment Company, L.L.C.) as the midstream assets.  KMP acquired its initial 50% ownership interest in the midstream assets effective June 1, 2012 from an investment vehicle affiliated with KKR for consideration of $289 million in common units.



On August 1, 2012, KMP acquired both the full ownership interest in TGP and an initial 50% ownership interest in EPNG from us for an aggregate consideration of approximately $6.2 billion, consisting of cash paid, common units issued and debt assumed.  In this report, we refer to the August 1, 2012 acquisition of assets from us as the August 2012 drop-down transaction; the combined group of assets acquired from us effective August 1, 2012 as the August 2012 drop-down asset group; the combined August 2012 drop-down transaction and the March 2013 drop-down transaction (described above) as the drop-down transactions; and the combined August 2012 drop-down asset group and the March 2013 drop-down asset group (described above) as the drop-down asset groups.










•On May 1, 2013, KMP closed its previously announced acquisition of Copano.  KMP acquired all of Copano’s outstanding units for a total purchase price of approximately $5.2 billion (including assumed debt and all other assumed liabilities).  The transaction was a 100% unit for unit transaction with an exchange ratio of 0.4563 of KMP’s common units for each Copano common unit.  KMP issued 43,371,210 of its common units valued at approximately $3.7 billion as consideration for the Copano acquisition (based on the $86.08 closing market price of a common unit on the NYSE on the May 1, 2013 issuance date).  In association with KMP’s Copano acquisition, we, as general partner of KMP, waived $75 million of incremental incentive distributions for 2013, and intend to forgo incentive distributions of $120 million for 2014, $120 million for 2015, $110 million for 2016 and annual amounts thereafter decreasing by $5 million per year from this level.



KMP’s acquisition of Copano added midstream natural gas assets located primarily in Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming to its existing business portfolio, and enlarged its existing service offerings to natural gas producers, including gathering, processing, treating and fractionation.  Additionally, as a result of this acquisition, KMP is currently pursing incremental development projects in the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas, and has gained entry into the Barnett shale formation in North Texas and the Mississippi Lime and Woodford shale formations in Oklahoma.  For more information about this acquisition, see Note 3 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements;



•In April 2013, KMP completed construction and began transportation service on a newly expanded segment of its DeWitt/Karnes (DK) natural gas pipeline system.  The DK pipeline system runs through DeWitt County and Karnes County, Texas, and in 2012, Copano initiated an approximately $120 million expansion project to extend the 24-inch diameter pipeline approximately 65 miles southwest into McMullen County, Texas.  The expansion was based on a fee-based agreement with a single customer whereby KMP provides midstream gathering and handling services in exchange for committed production volumes;



•In April 2013, KMP commissioned the first of two 400 MMcf/d cryogenic unit expansions at its Houston Central processing plant located in Colorado County, Texas.  KMP expects to complete the second expansion in mid-2014, and when completed, total processing capacity at the Houston Central plant will be approximately 1.5 Bcf/d.  The current estimate of total project construction costs including expansion of the pipeline capacity upstream of the plant is approximately $250 million;



•TGP continues to move forward on its approximately $83 million Rose Lake expansion project in northeastern Pennsylvania. The project will provide long-term firm transportation service for two shippers that have fully subscribed 230 MDth/d of firm capacity. Subject to regulatory approvals, a November 1, 2014, in-service date is anticipated;



•On July 2, 2013, KMP’s wholly-owned subsidiary Sierrita Gas Pipeline LLC entered into a Subscription Agreement with KMP, MGI Enterprises U.S. LLC (an affiliate of PEMEX) and MIT Pipeline Investment Americas, Inc. (an affiliate of Mitsui), whereby MGI and MIT acquired equity interests of 35% and 30%, respectively, in Sierrita in exchange for capital contributions.  Each member of Sierrita, including KMP, contributed approximately $5 million, determined based on the anticipated cash requirement of Sierrita through the end of September 2013.  Following the execution of a First Amended and Restated LLC Agreement, KMP now operates and owns a 35% equity interest in Sierrita Gas Pipeline LLC, and the investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting.



The company will invest approximately $72 million in the proposed Sierrita Pipeline Project, which includes construction of a 60-mile pipeline that will extend from the EPNG pipeline system, near Tucson, Arizona, to the Mexican border at Sasabe, Arizona. The 36-inch Sierrita Pipeline will have approximately 200 MMcf/d of capacity and an affiliate of PEMEX previously executed a 25-year agreement for all of the capacity. Subject to regulatory approvals, the pipeline is expected to be in service in September 2014;



•On September 1, 2013, TGP sold certain natural gas facilities located offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and onshore in the state of Louisiana to Kinetica Partners LLC for an aggregate consideration of $32 million in cash.  TGP’s investment in the net assets sold in this transaction totaled $89 million, and as a result of the sale, TGP recognized both a $93 million increase in regulated assets and a $36 million gain from the sale of assets in 2013;










•Field survey work continues for TGP’s fully subscribed approximately $77 million Connecticut expansion project.  The project will provide 72 MDth/d of additional long-term natural gas capacity to two local distribution customers.  The project includes constructing approximately 13-miles of new pipeline loops along the TGP system in Connecticut, New York and Massachusetts, and acquiring an existing pipeline lateral from another operator.  Pending regulatory approvals, the expansion project is expected to be operational on November 1, 2016;



•The proposed Cameron LNG liquefaction facility at Hackberry, Louisiana, in which we do not own an interest, received Department of Energy conditional approval for non-Free Trade Agreement export on February 11, 2014, and TGP continues to advance plans to transport 900 MDth/d of natural gas to the future facility under long-term agreements. Following a binding open season in the summer of 2013, TGP awarded 300 MDth/d of capacity to a subsidiary of MMGS Inc. (Mitsui) for a 20-year agreement to transport natural gas earmarked for the liquefaction facility, which is slated to begin LNG exports in the second half of 2017. Earlier in 2013, TGP announced a binding, 20-year agreement with anchor shipper Mitsubishi Corporation to ship 600 MDth/d of natural gas for the proposed project.  Future shipments by TGP are part of its approximately $138 million Southwest Louisiana Supply Project;



•On November 1, 2013, TGP completed and placed into service its previously announced $504 million Northeast Upgrade project.  The project expanded TGP’s pipeline facilities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey and provides for additional takeaway capacity from the Marcellus shale gas formation.  The fully-subscribed project increased system capacity on TGP’s 300 Line system by approximately 636 MDth/d through five segment loops and system upgrades at four existing compressor stations and one meter upgrade in New Jersey;



•On November 1, 2013, TGP completed and placed into service its previously announced $54 million Marcellus Pooling project.  The fully subscribed project provides approximately 240 MDth/d of additional firm transportation capacity from the Marcellus shale gas formation.  The expansion included approximately eight miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline looping, system modifications and upgrades to allow bi-directional flow at four existing compressor stations in Pennsylvania;



•TGP completed a successful binding open season in December for incremental, north-to-south natural gas transportation capacity on the TGP system totaling 500 MDth/d, which was awarded to five different shippers.  The awarded capacity will provide firm transportation service for Marcellus and Utica production from receipt points as far north as Mercer, Pennsylvania, for delivery to multiple delivery points on the Gulf Coast.  TGP will invest approximately $156 million in this Utica Backhaul project.  Capacity bids exceeded the capacity offered, and TGP is exploring further capacity expansions for its customers;



•TGP signed a binding, 15-year firm transportation agreement with Seneca Resources Corporation to ship 158 MDth/d of natural gas to eastern Canadian markets on the Niagara Expansion Project.  Subject to regulatory approvals, the approximately $26 million project is expected to begin service November 1, 2015.  Seneca will be the foundation shipper for TGP’s Niagara Expansion Project, designed to provide transportation from the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania to TGP’s interconnect with TransCanada Pipeline in Niagara County, New York, to serve growing markets for U.S. gas in eastern Canada; and



•KMP is investing approximately $126 million for additional compression and pipeline system modifications to expand the Kinder Morgan Texas and Mier-Monterrey pipelines.  The project is supported by three customers in Mexico that entered into long-term firm transportation contracts for more than 200 MMcf/d of capacity, which will be phased in from 2014 through 2016.  A fourth customer has also contracted for 150 MMcf/d of the project’s capacity on an interim basis for use prior to the effective date of the contracts with the other customers, accelerating the timing of the expansion for a projected initial in-service date of September 1, 2014.



EPB



•EPB announced in December that Shell US Gas & Power gave notice to EPB’s Elba Liquefaction Company joint venture to move forward on Phase II of the jointly owned natural gas liquefaction project at Elba Island LNG terminal near Savannah, Ga.  EPB’s SLC unit owns 51% of the Elba Liquefaction Company joint venture.  The additional capacity will range from 70 MMcf/d (0.5 million tonnes per year) up to 140 MMcf/d (1.0 million tonnes per year), with EPB’s share of estimated capital expenditure for Phase II at the maximum volume of 140 MMcf/d of approximately $224 million.  At full development, the Elba liquefaction project is expected to have total capacity of approximately 350 MMcf/d of natural gas (2.5 million tonnes per year of LNG) at a cost of approximately $1.5 billion.  Subject to regulatory approvals, Phase I is anticipated to be in service in late 2016 or early 2017 and Phase II is expected to be in service in 2017-2018.










•SNG and Elba Express will invest approximately $279 million to expand its systems following successful open seasons held in August 2013 for incremental, long-term natural gas transportation service.  The open seasons generated customer interest in incremental capacity of greater than 700,000 Dth/d that will support southeastern U.S. infrastructure growth and the needs of customers in Georgia, South Carolina and northern Florida.  EEC customers have expressed interest that could add incremental capacity of approximately 300,000 Dth/d to the project, which, if constructed, would bring the total capacity of the expansions to approximately 1 Bcf/d.  EEC expects an in-service date as early as June 2016 pending regulatory approvals.



•SNG placed its Rose Hill Project into service on schedule in November, which involved facility modifications to benefit both SNG and TGP, a subsidiary of KMP.  The approximately $25 million SNG portion of the project allows SNG customers to shift about 450,000 Dth/d to different receipt locations including an interconnection between SNG and TGP.  The approximately $9 million TGP portion of the project improved the delivery capabilities from TGP to SNG.



•Construction continues on the WYCO High Plains Expansion Project, a joint venture between CIG and Xcel Energy.  The project began partial service in November of 2013, and the approximately $22 million project (EPB’s share is $11 million) is expected to be completed in the spring of this year.  CIG is constructing approximately 8 miles of pipeline and making other modifications to provide additional takeaway capacity from the Denver-Julesburg Basin and link this prolific basin with CIG’s High Plains pipeline system.  The project is supported by two shippers who signed long-term contracts for an initial 250,000 Dth/d.



CO2-KMP



•On June 1, 2013, KMP acquired certain oil and gas properties, rights, and related assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas from Legado Resources LLC for approximately $285 million (before working capital adjustments and excluding assumed liabilities).  The acquisition of the Goldsmith Landreth San Andres oil field unit includes more than 6,000 acres located in Ector County, Texas.  The acquired oil field is in the early stages of CO2flood development and includes a residual oil zone along with a classic San Andres waterflood.  The field currently produces approximately 1,230 Bbl/d of oil, and as part of the transaction, KMP obtained a long-term supply contract (now held by one of its wholly-owned subsidiaries) for up to 150 MMcf/d of CO2;



•Construction continues on KMP’s approximately $214 million Yellow Jacket Central Facility expansion at the McElmo Dome CO2source field in southwest Colorado.  The first of four planned expansion projects is expected to be operational by November 2014.  These expansions will increase CO2production from 1.1 Bcf/d to 1.23 Bcf/d;



•In September 2013, KMP completed the parallel (primary) compression portion of its previously announced $255 million investment to expand the CO2capacity of its approximately 87%-owned Doe Canyon Deep unit in southwestern Colorado.  Doe Canyon is now producing about 200 MMcf/d of CO2, substantially higher than the initial projection of 170 MMcf/d.  Construction was completed and the booster compression was available for service in mid-December 2013.  Additional well drilling and completions in the field have allowed continued production without operation of the booster compression.  Booster compression operation is expected to begin in late 2015.  Final work continues on pipeline insulation, painting, and final cleanup and is expected to be complete in early April of 2014.  KMP plans to drill approximately 18 more wells during the next ten years, with four expected to be drilled in 2014; and



•Work continues on the expansion of KMP’s Wink Pipeline System, which transports crude oil from the company’s West Texas oil fields to Western Refining Company’s facility in El Paso, Texas.  KMP is in the process of increasing Wink’s capacity from 132 MBbl/d to 145 MBbl/d to meet expected higher future throughput requirements at Western’s refinery.  KMP anticipates that the new facilities will be online in the first quarter of 2014.



Products Pipelines-KMP



•On September 3, 2013, KMP and Valero Energy Corporation completed construction and placed into service the previously announced Parkway Pipeline, a new 141-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline that transports refined petroleum products from refineries located in Norco, Louisiana, to Plantation Pipe Line Company’s (KMP’s approximately 51%-owned equity investee) petroleum transportation hub located in Collins, Mississippi.  KMP will operate and own a 50% equity interest in the Parkway Pipeline LLC, which has an initial capacity of 110 MBbl/d, with the ability to








expand to over 200 MBbl/d.  The approximately $260 million pipeline system is supported by a long-term throughput agreement with a credit-worthy shipper;



•Construction continues on the approximately $360 million petroleum condensate processing facility located near KMP’s Galena Park terminal on the Houston Ship Channel.  Supported by a long-term, fee-based agreement with BP North America for substantially all 100 MBbl/d of throughput capacity at the facility, the project includes building two separate units to split condensate into its various components and the construction of storage tanks for the almost 2 MMBbl of product that will be split at the facility.  The first phase of the splitter is scheduled to be commissioned in June 2014 and the second phase is expected to come online in the second quarter of 2015;



•KMP continues to make progress on pipeline modifications for its approximately $310 million Cochin Reversal project to move light condensate from Kankakee County, Illinois, to existing terminal facilities near Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.  Construction also is underway on the 1 MMBbl storage capacity Kankakee tank farm and associated pipeline facilities where Cochin will interconnect with the Explorer Pipeline and the Enterprise TEPPCO Pipeline.  The project remains on schedule for a late June 2014 in-service date;



•Tank and pipeline construction continues on KMP’s approximately $109 million expansion of its KMCC pipeline to ConocoPhillips’ central delivery facility in Karnes County, Texas.  The project, supported by a long-term contract with ConocoPhillips, will extend the 178-mile pipeline 31 miles west from the company’s DeWitt Station (west of Cuero, Texas) to ConocoPhillips’ central delivery facility in Helena, Texas.  KMP expects to complete the project in the third quarter of 2014;



•In January 2014, KMP completed and placed into service its approximately $101 million, 27-mile Sweeny Lateral pipeline, which transports Eagle Ford crude and condensate from its KMCC pipeline to Phillips 66’s Sweeny Refinery in Brazoria County, Texas.  The two 120,000-barrel storage tanks and seven truck offloading racks at KMP’s DeWitt County station are also complete and in service, and the new pumps and two 120,000-barrel storage tanks at KMP’s Wharton County pump station will be completed February, 2014;



•KMP has entered into an agreement with a large Eagle Ford Shale producer to extend the KMCC pipeline farther into the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas.  KMP will invest approximately $74 million to build an 18-mile lateral pipeline northwest from its DeWitt Station to a new facility in Gonzales County, where it will construct 300 MBbl of storage, a pipeline pump station and truck offloading facilities.  The lateral will have a capacity of 300 MBbl/d and will enable KMP to batch Eagle Ford Gathering LLC crude oil and condensate from the new Gonzales Station via KMCC to its delivery points on the Houston Ship Channel and the soon to be in service Sweeny Lateral pipeline serving the Phillips 66 Sweeny Refinery in Brazoria County, Texas.  Construction on the pipeline will start later this month and the project is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2015;



•In December 2013, KMP and NOVA Chemicals Corporation announced a letter of intent to develop a new products pipeline from the Utica Shale.  Under the agreement, KMP’s Cochin pipeline will construct, own and operate a 210-mile pipeline from multiple fractionation facilities in Harrison County, Ohio, to KMP’s Cochin pipeline near Riga, Michigan, where the company will then move product via Cochin east to Windsor, Ontario, Canada.  The proposed approximately $300 million KMP Utica To Ontario Pipeline Access (UTOPIA) would transport previously refined or fractionated NGL, including ethane and propane.  UTOPIA is expected to have an initial 50 MBbl/d of capacity, which is expandable to more than 75 MBbl/d, and anticipates a mid-year 2017 in-service date, pending NOVA’s execution of a definitive agreement during the binding open season (which is expected in 2014) and timely receipt of necessary permitting and regulatory approvals; and



•KMP and Targa Resources Partners signed a letter of intent in December 2013 to form a joint venture to construct new NGL fractionation facilities at Mont Belvieu, Texas, to provide services for producers in the Utica and Marcellus Shale resource plays in Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania.  The obligations under the letter of intent are conditioned upon a successful open season and the construction of the Utica Marcellus Texas Pipeline (UMTP).  UMTP is a proposed joint venture between MarkWest Utica EMG and KMP (also announced in the third quarter of 2013), of up to 150 MBbl/d expandable to 400 MBbl/d of maximum pipeline capacity over time.  The new NGL fractionation facilities would be located adjacent to Targa’s existing fractionation facilities at Mont Belvieu and would provide fractionation services for customers of UMTP.  To allow shippers time to assess their Gulf Coast fractionation and pipeline needs, the binding open season currently under way for the proposed Y-grade UMTP has been extended until February 28, 2014.  UMTP would involve the abandonment and conversion of over 1,000 miles of our existing TGP system, currently in natural gas service, and building approximately 200 miles of new pipeline.








•KMP entered into a long term agreement in January 2014 with BP North America (BP) for pipeline transportation of Eagle Ford condensate to the Houston Ship Channel.  The $28 million project includes construction of tankage and truck rack receipt facilities at the KMCC Helena Station in Karnes County, Texas and is scheduled to be operational in the first quarter of 2015.  This new origin facility will provide additional supply for the 100 MBbl/d condensate processing facility subscribed to by BP and currently under construction by KMCC in Galena Park, Texas.



•In December 2013, KMP and its Double Eagle joint venture signed a long term agreement with Anadarko for firm transportation service of Eagle Ford condensate to the Houston Ship Channel.  Improvements include construction of tanks and a pump station near Gardendale in LaSalle County, Texas and a new ten mile pipeline joining the Double Eagle and KMCC pipeline systems at Helena Station in Karnes County, Texas.  KMP’s share of the total project cost is approximately $45 million and the facilities are expected to be operational in early 2015.



Terminals-KMP



•In August 2013, KMP completed and commissioned for service its previously announced petroleum coke terminal located at BP’s Whiting refinery in Hammond, Indiana.  KMP expects that the terminal will handle approximately 2.2 million tons of petroleum coke per year for the next three years, and this volume is supported by a 20-year service contract with BP.  KMP invested approximately $62 million for the construction of this facility, which includes nine conveyors, a 30,000-ton storage barn and a fleet of 190 railcars to move approximately 6,000 tons of petroleum coke per day;

•As of the date of this report, construction continues on the previously announced three phase export coal expansion project at KMP’s International Marine Terminals facility (IMT), a multi-product, import-export facility located in Myrtle Grove, Louisiana and owned 66 2/3% by KMP.  In August 2013, KMP completed the project’s $83 million phase one, which added approximately 800,000 tons of ground storage to the facility.  The remaining two phases entail adding a new continuous barge unloader, a new coal reclaim conveyor system and an additional five million tons of coal throughput capacity.  KMP expects the entire project to be operational in the second quarter of 2014 and currently, its estimated share of the total expansion project at International Marine Terminals (including all phases) is approximately $150 million;

•Construction continues on KMP’s investment of $106 million to meet customer demand in the Houston Ship Channel with a new barge dock adjacent to KMP’s Pasadena terminal and nine new storage tanks (with total capacity of 1.2 MMBbl at its Galena Park terminal.  The new barge dock is expected to help relieve current dock congestion on the Houston Ship Channel and will enable KMP to handle up to 50 barges per month.  The tanks are expected to be placed in-service as they are completed beginning in the third quarter of 2014 and ending in the first quarter of 2015.  The barge dock is slated for a fourth quarter 2015 completion;



•KMP’s 185-acre Battleground Oil Specialty Terminal Company LLC project located on the Houston Ship Channel is continuing to progress toward completion.  Thirty-one of the 51 storage tanks built during phase one construction have been placed in service and the remaining tanks will come online during the first half of 2014.  A two-berth ship dock and 12 barge berths were also placed in service in October, 2013.  Phase two construction also continues and involves building an additional 0.9 MMBbl of storage capacity.  BOSTCO expects phase two to begin service in the third quarter of 2014.  The approximately $500 million BOSTCO terminal is fully subscribed for a total capacity of 7.1 MMBbl and is able to handle ultra-low sulfur diesel, residual fuels and other black oil terminal services.  KMP owns 55% of and operates BOSTCO;



•KMP is preparing a 42-acre site along the Houston Ship Channel for construction of a new ship dock to handle ocean going vessels and 1.5 MMBbl of liquids storage tanks.  The approximately $172 million project is supported by a long-term contract with a major ship channel refiner to construct the tanks and connect KMP’s Galena Park terminal to the refiner’s location.  Construction is scheduled to begin in the second quarter of 2014 and the project is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2016;



•Construction continues at KMP’s Edmonton Terminal expansion in Alberta, Canada.  By the end of February 2014, nine tanks with a capacity of 3.4 MMBbl will be in service and phase one will be complete.  Construction also continues on phase two, which will add an incremental 1.2 MMBbl storage capacity and is expected to be completed in late 2014.  The approximately $419 million project is supported by long-term contracts with major producers and refiners;










•In December 2013, KMP announced a joint venture with Imperial Oil to build the Edmonton Rail Terminal, a crude oil loading facility, near its Edmonton storage terminal on land adjacent to Imperial’s Strathcona Refinery.  Construction is underway on the Edmonton Rail Terminal, which will be capable of loading one to three unit trains per day totaling 100 MBbl/d at startup, with the potential to expand up to 250 MBbl/d.  The new rail terminal will be connected via pipeline to the Trans Mountain terminal and will be capable of sourcing crude oil handled by KMP for delivery by rail to North American markets and refineries.  The rail will be constructed and operated by KMP and will connect to both Canadian National and Canadian Pacific mainlines.  The joint venture is investing approximately $175 million in the project, and KMP will invest an additional approximately $100 million in pipeline connections and new staging tanks.  The facility is expected to be in service at the end of 2014; and



•On January 17, 2014, KMP acquired American Petroleum Tankers (APT) and State Class Tankers (SCT) from affiliates of The Blackstone Group and Cerberus Capital Management for an aggregate consideration of approximately $962 million in cash.  APT and SCT are engaged in the marine transportation of crude oil, condensate and refined products in the U.S. domestic trade, commonly referred to as the Jones Act trade.  KMP expects that the transaction will be immediately accretive to cash available to its unitholders.

Kinder Morgan Canada -KMP



•On March 14, 2013, KMP closed the previously announced sale of both its one-third equity ownership interest in the Express pipeline system and its subordinated debenture investment in Express to Spectra Energy Corp.  For the divestiture of its investments, KMP received net cash proceeds of $402 million (after settlements of both final working capital balances and transaction related selling costs), and it recorded both a pre-tax gain amount of $224 million and an associated increase in income tax expense of $84 million; and



•Trans Mountain Pipeline filed a Facilities Application with Canada’s NEB in December 2013 requesting authorization to build and operate the necessary facilities for the proposed $5.4 billion pipeline system expansion.  With this filing, the proposed project will undergo a comprehensive public regulatory review.  For the past 18 months, Kinder Morgan Canada has engaged and will continue to engage extensively with landowners, Aboriginal groups, communities and stakeholders along the proposed expansion route, and marine communities.  The next step is for the NEB to establish a hearing schedule that corresponds to the federal government’s legislated 15-month review and decision time frame.  Thirteen companies in the Canadian producing, refining and oil export business have signed firm contracts representing a total volume commitment of approximately 708 MBbl/d.  Kinder Morgan Canada received approval of the commercial terms related to the expansion from the NEB in May of 2013.  The proposed expansion will increase capacity on Trans Mountain from approximately 300 MBbl/d to 890 MBbl/d.  If approvals are received as planned, the expansion is expected to be operational at the end of 2017.



Other Segment



•On January 18, 2013, we completed the sale of our equity interests in the Bolivia to Brazil Pipeline that we had acquired as part of the EP acquisition for $88 million. See Note 3 “Acquisitions and Divestitures” to our consolidated financial statements.



Financings



•For information about our 2013 debt offerings and retirements, see Note 8 “Debt” to our consolidated financial statements.  For information about our 2013 equity offerings, see Note 10 “Stockholders’ Equity-Non-Controlling Interests-Contributions” to our consolidated financial statements.



2014 Outlook



KMP



•As previously announced, KMP anticipates that for the year 2014, (i) it will declare total annual cash distributions of $5.58 per unit, a 5% increase over its cash distributions of $5.33 per unit for 2013; (ii) its business segments will generate approximately $6.4 billion in EBDA , including amortization of excess cost of equity investments and its proportionate share of all DD&A of its unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for under the equity-method of accounting; (iii) it will distribute over $2.5 billion to its limited partners; (iv) it will produce excess cash flow of approximately$15 million above its cash distribution target of $5.58 per unit; and (v) it will invest approximately $3.6








billion for its capital expansion program (including small acquisitions and contributions to joint ventures, but excluding acquisitions from us).

KMP expects that a full-year of contributions from its 2013 acquisitions and expansions, along with partial-year contributions from its anticipated 2014 expansion investments, as described above under -Recent Developments, will help drive earnings and cash flow growth in 2014 and beyond.  Generally, KMP’s base cash flows (that is, cash flows not attributable to acquisitions or expansions) are relatively stable from year to year and are largely supported by multi-year, fee-based customer arrangements.  In addition, KMP’s expectations for 2014 discussed above involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance.  Many of the factors that will determine these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict, and because of these uncertainties, it is advisable to not put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.  Please read Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for more information.  Furthermore, we plan to provide updates to our 2014 expectations when we believe previously disclosed expectations no longer have a reasonable basis.

KMP’s expectations assume an average WTI crude oil price of approximately $96.15 per barrel in 2014.  Although cash generated by KMP’s assets is predominantly fee based and is generally not sensitive to commodity prices, the CO2-KMP business segment is exposed to commodity price risk related to the price volatility of crude oil and NGL.  KMP hedges the majority of its crude oil production, but it does have exposure to unhedged volumes, the majority of which are NGL volumes.  For 2014, KMP expects that every $1 change in the average WTI crude oil price per barrel will impact the CO2-KMP segment’s cash flows by approximately $7 million (or approximately 0.125% of KMP’s combined business segments’ anticipated EBDA expenses).

EPB

•EPB expects to declare total cash distribution of $2.60 per unit for 2014, an approximate 2% increase over the $2.55 per unit distributions for 2013.  EPB’s 2014 budget includes the expected purchase (drop-down transaction) from us of a 50% interest in Ruby Pipeline Holding Company, L.L.C., a 50% interest in Gulf LNG Holdings Group, LLC and a 47.5% interest in Young Gas Storage Company, LTD.  The positive impact from the expected drop-down transaction at attractive multiples will be largely offset by the impacts of the SNG and WIC rate case settlements and expected lower rates on contract renewals on the WIC system.  In 2014, EPB expects its regulated pipeline and storage assets, along with its LNG business, to generate earnings before DD&A of approximately $1.3 billion (adding back EPB’s share of joint venture DD&A), an increase of almost $90 million compared to 2013.  EPB also has approximately $1.3 billion of expansion projects under contract with customers, which will benefit its unitholders in 2016 and beyond.  Generally, EPB’s base cash flows (that is, cash flows not attributable to acquisitions or expansions) are relatively stable from year to year and are largely supported by reservation charges under firm transportation and storage contracts.



KMI

•KMI expects to declare dividends of $1.72 per share for 2014, an 8% increase over its 2013 declared dividend of $1.60 per share.  Growth in 2014 cash dividends is expected to be driven by continued strong performance at KMP and contributions from EPB.  The growth at KMI from KMP and EPB cash distributions will be partially offset by the loss of income from the 2013 and expected 2014 sales (drop-down) of certain assets to EPB, as described above.

Our expectations for 2014 discussed above involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, and are not guarantees of performance.  Many of the factors that will determine whether we will obtain these expectations are beyond our ability to control or predict, and because of these uncertainties, it is inadvisable to put undue reliance on any forward-looking statement.  Please read our Item 1A “Risk Factors” below for more information.



(b) Financial Information about Segments

For financial information on our six reportable business segments, see Note 15 “Reportable Segments” to our consolidated financial statements.












(c) Narrative Description of Business





Business Strategy

Our business strategy is to:

•focus on stable, fee-based energy transportation and storage assets that are central to the energy infrastructure ofgrowing markets within North America;

•increase utilization of our existing assets while controlling costs, operating safely, and employing environmentally sound operating practices;

•leverage economies of scale from incremental acquisitions and expansions of assets that fit within our strategy and are accretive to cash flow; and

•maximize the benefits of our financial structure to create and return value to our stockholders.



It is our intention to carry out the above business strategy, modified as necessary to reflect changing economic conditions and other circumstances.  However, as discussed under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” below, there are factors that could affect our ability to carry out our strategy or affect its level of success even if carried out.



We (primarily through KMP and EPB) regularly consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions and are currently contemplating potential acquisitions.  Any such transaction would be subject to negotiation of mutually agreeable terms and conditions, receipt of fairness opinions, if applicable, and approval of the parties’ respective boards of directors.  While there are currently no unannounced purchase agreements for the acquisition of any material business or assets, such transactions can be effected quickly, may occur at any time and may be significant in size relative to our existing assets or operations.





Business Segments

We own and manage a diversified portfolio of energy transportation and storage assets.  Our operations are conducted through the following reportable business segments:

•Natural Gas Pipelines—for all periods presented in our financial statements this segment consists of approximately 68,000 miles of natural gas transmission pipelines and gathering lines, plus natural gas storage, treating and processing facilities, through which natural gas is gathered, transported, stored, treated, processed and sold and other equity interests.

•CO2—KMP—which produces, markets and transports, through approximately 1,500 miles of pipelines, CO2 to oil fields that use CO2 to increase production of oil; owns interests in and/or operate four primary oil fields in West Texas; and owns and operates a 450-mile crude oil pipeline system in West Texas;

•Products Pipelines—KMP—which consists of approximately 9,000 miles of refined petroleum products and crude oil and condensate pipelines that deliver refined petroleum products (gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel), NGL, crude oil, condensate and bio-fuels to various markets; plus approximately 62 associated product terminals and petroleum pipeline transmix processing facilities serving customers across the U.S.;

These contracts obligate EP to sell natural gas to these plants and have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2028.  This segment also included an interest in the Bolivia to Brazil Pipeline, which we sold for $88 million on January 18, 2013.












Natural Gas Pipelines

Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment includes interstate and intrastate pipelines and our LNG terminals, and includes both FERC regulated and non-FERC regulated assets.  Our non-FERC regulated assets are contained in KMP’s Midstream Group.

Our primary businesses in this segment consist of natural gas sales, transportation, storage, gathering, processing and treating, and the terminaling of LNG. Within this segment, are: (i)  KMP’s assets - approximately 40,000 miles of natural gas pipelines; and (ii) EPB’s assets - approximately 13,000 miles of natural gas pipelines; and (iii) our equity interests in entities that have approximately 15,000 miles of natural gas pipelines, along with associated storage and supply lines for these transportation networks, that are strategically located throughout the North American natural gas pipeline grid.  KMP’s transportation network provides access to the major natural gas supply areas in the western U.S., Louisiana, Texas, the Midwest and Northeast, as well as major consumer markets. EPB’s transportation network provides access to the major gas supply areas and consumer markets in the Rocky Mountain, Midwest and Southeastern regions.  EPB’s LNG storage and regasification terminal also serves natural gas supply areas in the southeast.

KMP

KMP Midstream Group

Texas Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Group

The Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group, which operates primarily along the Texas Gulf Coast, consists of the following four natural gas pipeline systems: (i) Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline; (ii) Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline; (iii) Mier-Monterrey Mexico Pipeline; and (iv) Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline.

The two largest systems in the group are Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline and the Kinder Morgan Tejas Pipeline.  These pipelines essentially operate as a single pipeline system, providing customers and suppliers with improved flexibility and reliability.  The combined system includes approximately 5,763 miles of intrastate natural gas pipelines with a peak transport and sales capacity of approximately 6 Bcf/d of natural gas and approximately 118 billion cubic feet of on-system natural gas storage capacity.  In addition, the combined system (i) has facilities to both treat approximately180 MMcf/d of natural gas for CO2and hydrogen sulfide removal, and to process approximately85 MMcf/d of natural gas for liquids extraction; and (ii) holds contractual rights to process natural gas at certain third party facilities.  Transport volumes in 2013 averaged 1,743

BBtu/d.



The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline consists of a 95-mile natural gas pipeline that stretches from the international border between the U.S. and Mexico in Starr County, Texas, to Monterrey, Mexico and can transport up to 425 MMcf/d, though this capacity is being expanded to 640 MMcf/d. The pipeline connects to the Pemex natural gas transportation system and serves a 1,000-megawatt power plant complex.  KMP has entered into long-term contracts which have subscribed for substantially all of the pipeline’s capacity.  Transport volumes in 2013 averaged 379 BBtu/d.



The Kinder Morgan North Texas Pipeline consists of an 82-mile pipeline that transports natural gas from an interconnect with the facilities of NGPL (a 20%-owned equity investee of KMI) in Lamar County, Texas to a 1,750-megawatt electricity generating facility located in Forney, Texas, 15 miles east of Dallas, Texas and to a 1,000-megawatt electricity generating facility located near Paris, Texas.  It has the capacity to transport 325 MMcf/d of natural gas and is fully subscribed under a long-term contract that expires in 2032.  The system is bi-directional, permitting deliveries of additional supply from the Barnett Shale area toNGPL’s pipeline as well as power plants in the area.  Transport volumes in 2013 averaged 262 BBtu/d.



Texas is one of the largest natural gas consuming states in the country.  The natural gas demand profile in KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group’s market area is primarily composed of industrial (including on-site cogeneration facilities), merchant and utility power, and local natural gas distribution consumption.  The industrial demand is primarily a year-round load.  Merchant and utility power demand peaks in the summer months and is complemented by local natural gas distribution demand that peaks in the winter months.



Collectively, KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline system primarily serves the Texas Gulf Coast by selling, transporting, processing and treating natural gas from multiple supply sources to serve the Houston/Beaumont/Port Arthur/Austin industrial markets, local natural gas distribution utilities, electric utilities and merchant power generation markets.  It serves as a buyer and seller of natural gas, as well as a transporter of natural gas.



The purchases and sales of natural gas are primarily priced with reference to market prices in the consuming region of the system.  The difference between the purchase and sale prices is the rough equivalent of a transportation fee and fuel










costs.  Generally, KMP purchases natural gas directly from producers with reserves connected to its intrastate natural gas system in South Texas, East Texas, West Texas, and along the Texas Gulf Coast.  In addition, KMP also purchase gas at interconnects with third-party interstate and intrastate pipelines.  While the intrastate group does not produce gas, it does maintain an active well connection program in order to offset natural declines in production along its system and to secure supplies for additional demand in its market area.  KMP’s intrastate system is interconnected with both LNG import terminals located on the Texas Gulf Coast.  The intrastate group also has access to markets within and outside of Texas through interconnections with numerous interstate natural gas pipelines.



Kinder Morgan Treating L.P.



KMP’s subsidiary, Kinder Morgan Treating, L.P., owns and operates (or leases to producers for operation) treating plants that remove impurities (such as CO2and hydrogen sulfide) and hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas before it is delivered into gathering systems and transmission pipelines to ensure that it meets pipeline quality specifications.  Additionally, its subsidiary KM Treating Production LLC designs, constructs and sells custom and stock natural gas treating plants and condensate stabilizers. KMP’s rental fleet of treating assets includes approximately 211 natural gas amine-treating plants, approximately 20 hydrocarbon dew point control plants, and approximately 186 mechanical refrigeration units that are used to remove impurities and hydrocarbon liquids from natural gas streams prior to entering transmission pipelines.



KinderHawk Field Services LLC

Its assets currently consist of approximately480 miles of natural gas gathering pipeline currently in service and natural gas amine treating plants having a current capacity of approximately2,600 gallons per minute (GPM).  KinderHawk owns life of lease dedications to gather and treat substantially all of BHP Billiton (BHP) operated Haynesville and Bossier shale gas production at agreed upon rates, as well as minimum volume commitments for a five-year term that expires in May 2015.  KinderHawk also holds additional third-party gas gathering and treating commitments.  The system is designed to have approximately 2.0 Bcf/d of throughput capacity, however, due primarily to reduced drilling activities, the 2013 average gathering volume was 668 BBtu/d of natural gas.



BHP Billiton Petroleum (Eagle Ford Gathering) LLC



Formerly known as EagleHawk Field Services LLC and currently referred to as EagleHawk in this document, provides natural gas and condensate gathering, treating, condensate stabilization and transportation services in the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas.  KMP owns a 25% equity ownership in EagleHawk, and accounts for its 25% investment under the equity method of accounting.  BHP operates EagleHawk and owns the remaining 75% ownership interest.  EagleHawk owns two midstream gathering systems in and around BHP’s Hawkville and Black Hawk areas of the Eagle Ford shale formation and combined, its assets consist of natural gas gathering pipelines and condensate gathering lines. The system is designed to have approximately 700 MMcf/d of throughput capacity.  In addition, EagleHawk has a life of lease dedication of certain of BHP’s Eagle Ford shale reserves, and to a limited extent, contracts with other producers in the Eagle Ford shale formation to provide natural gas and condensate gathering, treating, condensate stabilization and transportation services.  The 2013 average gathering volume was 131 BBtu/d of natural gas.



Red Cedar Gathering Company



KMP owns a 49% equity interest in Red Cedar, a joint venture organized in August 1994.  Red Cedar owns and operates natural gas gathering, compression and treating facilities in the Ignacio Blanco Field in La Plata County, Colorado.  The remaining 51% interest in Red Cedar is owned by the Southern Ute Indian Tribe.  Red Cedar’s natural gas gathering system currently consists of approximately 755 miles of gathering pipeline connecting more than 900 producing wells, 133,400 horsepower of compression at 20 field compressor stations and three CO2treating plants.  The 2013 average gathering volume was270 BBtu/d of natural gas and the treating capacity is approximately 750 MMcf/d.












Kinder Morgan Altamont LLC and Camino Real Gathering, L.L.C.



Effective March 1, 2013, as part of the March 2013 drop-down transaction, KMP acquired the remaining 50% equity ownership interest in the midstream assets that it did not already own.  The midstream assets include KMP’s subsidiaries Kinder Morgan Altamont LLC and Camino Real Gathering Company, L.L.C.  These entities own and operate the Altamont natural gas gathering, processing and treating assets located in the Uinta Basin in Utah, and the Camino Real natural gas and oil gathering systems located in the Eagle Ford shale formation in South Texas.

The natural gas gathering system has takeaway capacity of approximately 115 MMcf/d.



Copano operations (including Eagle Ford Gathering LLC)



The Copano operations assets (including equity investments owned by Copano) include natural gas gathering and intrastate transportation pipeline assets, natural gas processing and fractionation facilities and NGL pipelines.  Through the Copano operations’ natural gas pipelines, KMP gathers natural gas from wellheads or designated points near producing wells.  KMP also treats and processes natural gas as needed to remove contaminants and extract mixed NGL, and it delivers the resulting residue gas to its own and third-party pipelines, local distribution companies, power generation facilities and industrial customers.  KMP also sells extracted NGL as a mixture or as fractionated purity products, and it delivers them through its pipeline interconnects and truck loading facilities.  KMP processes natural gas from both its own gathering systems and from third-party pipelines, and in some cases, it delivers natural gas and mixed NGL to other third parties who provide KMP with transportation, processing or fractionation services.  KMP commonly divides its Copano operations into four regions: South Texas, North Texas, Oklahoma and Rocky Mountain.  In 2013, gathering volumes averaged 1,694 BBtu/d and transport volumes averaged 26 BBtu/d.



Copano South Texas Region



The Copano South Texas operations deliver a majority of the natural gas gathered on KMP’s wholly owned gathering systems to KMP’s Houston Central complex located in Colorado County, Texas. At the Houston Central complex, KMP provides treating, processing and NGL fractionation and transportation services, as needed. The plant and related facilities has approximately 1.1 Bcf/d of processing capacity, consisting of 500 MMcf/d lean oil and 600 MMcf/d cryogenic processing facilities.  A new 400 MMcf/d cryogenic processing train (or tower) is under construction, and when it is placed into service at the end of the second quarter of 2014, will largely replace capacity currently served by the less-efficient “lean oil” method of extracting valuable NGL. The Houston Central complex also includes a1,725 GPM amine treating system, a 44 MBbl/d NGL fractionation facility and a truck rack to facilitate the transport of NGL.



The gathering systems have access to the Houston Central, through both KMP’s DeWitt/Karnes (DK) pipeline system (which extends from DeWitt County and Karnes County, Texas), and its Laredo-to-Katy (LK) pipeline system (which extends along the Texas Gulf Coast from south Texas to Houston).  KMP’s Houston Central complex straddles its LK pipeline system, which allows it to move natural gas from its pipeline systems in south Texas and near the Texas Gulf Coast to the Houston Central complex for processing and treating and then on to downstream markets.  KMP also delivers gas from its south Texas gathering systems to other third-party pipelines and processing plants.  Depending on the contractual arrangements, third-party service providers collect fees, retain a portion of the NGL, or retain a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the NGL and residue gas in exchange for their services.



KMP provides midstream natural gas services to Eagle Ford Shale producers through its wholly-owned subsidiary Eagle Ford Gathering LLC (Eagle Ford). Eagle Ford provides natural gas gathering, transportation and processing services to natural gas producers in the Eagle Ford shale gas formation in South Texas.  The Eagle Ford has approximately190 miles of pipelines










with capacity to gather and has contracted processing capacity at Houston Central and third party plants to process over 585 MMcf/d.



The South Texas Copano operations include pipelines which gather natural gas from counties to the north of Houston, Texas and take deliveries from several third-party pipelines.  KMP then delivers or sells the natural gas gathered or transported on these systems to utilities and industrial customers.  KMP also provides gas conditioning and processing services to natural gas producers in the Woodbine and Eaglebine shale gas formations, emerging rich resource plays located in East Texas near its gathering systems.



The South Texas Copano operations also include KMP’s (i) 62.5% equity ownership interest in Webb/Duval Gatherers, the sole owner of the Webb/Duval gas gathering system that provides natural gas gathering services in South Texas; and (ii) 50% equity ownership interest in Liberty Pipeline Group, LLC, the sole owner of the Liberty pipeline system which transports mixed NGL from KMP’s Houston Central complex to the Texas Gulf Coast.  Webb/Duval Gatherers is a general partnership that KMP operates.  Each partner has the right to use its pro rata share of pipeline capacity on this system, subject to applicable ratable take and common purchaser statutes.  Energy Transfer Partners, L.P. operates and owns the remaining 50% interest in the Liberty pipeline system.



Copano North Texas Region



The Copano North Texas region provides midstream natural gas services in North Texas, including gathering of natural gas, and related services including compression, dehydration, amine treating, processing and marketing.



KMP’s Copano North Texas pipelines gather natural gas from the north Barnett shale combo play located in Cook, Denton, Montague and Wise Counties in Texas and deliver the natural gas to both its Saint Jo processing plant located in Montague County, Texas and to third-party processing plants and pipelines.  A large majority of the natural gas on the North Texas system comes from a single producer under a long term contract which includes certain acreage dedications and volume commitments.  KMP’s Saint Jo high recovery cryogenic plant has an inlet capacity of 100 MMcf/d, and contains both a1,500 GPM amine treating facility and condensate stabilization facilities.  KMP’s Saint Jo NGL pipeline system transports NGL from the plant to ONEOK Partners’ Hydrocarbon’s Arbuckle NGL pipeline system.



Copano Oklahoma Region



The Copano Oklahoma region provides midstream natural gas services in central and east Oklahoma, including primarily low-pressure gathering of natural gas and related services such as compression, dehydration, treating, processing and nitrogen rejection.  In addition to gathering natural gas to KMP’s plants, the Oklahoma segment delivers natural gas to third-party plants. Depending on the contractual arrangements, third parties collect processing fees, retain a portion of the NGL or residue gas, or retain a portion of the proceeds from the sale of the NGL and residue gas in exchange for their services.



The Oklahoma region includes seven natural gas processing plants with a combined capacity of 236 MMcf/d, and over 3,900 miles of gathering pipelines.  The region includes the operations of Southern Dome, LLC, which provides gathering and processing services within the Southern Dome prospect in the southern portion of Oklahoma County.  KMP consolidates and currently holds a 69.5% ownership interest in Southern Dome.



Copano Rocky Mountain Region



The Copano Rocky Mountain region provides midstream natural gas services in the Powder River Basin of Wyoming, including gathering and treating of natural gas.  The region includes KMP’s (i) 51% equity ownership interest in Bighorn Gas Gathering, LLC, the sole owner of the Bighorn natural gas gathering system; and (ii) 37.04% equity ownership interest in Fort Union Gas Gathering, LLC, the sole owner of the Fort Union natural gas gathering system.  The Rocky Mountain region also includes firm gathering agreements with Fort Union; firm transportation agreements with Wyoming Interstate Gas Company (WIC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EBP (which capacity has been released to various producers); and services provided to a number of producers in the Powder River Basin, including producers who deliver natural gas into the Bighorn or Fort Union gathering systems.












Bighorn provides low and high pressure natural gas gathering service to coal-bed methane producers in the Powder River Basin. KMP serves as managing member and field operator of Bighorn.  Fort Union takes delivery of natural gas from Bighorn, provides gathering services to other producers and provides amine treating services at its Medicine Bow treating facility in order to meet the quality specifications of downstream pipelines. Pipeline interconnects downstream from the Fort Union system include WIC, Tallgrass Interstate Gas Transportation and Colorado Interstate Gas Company (CIG), a wholly-owned subsidiary of EBP.



Fort Union has firm gathering agreements with each of its four owners, including KMP.  Each owner has the right to use a fixed quantity of firm gathering capacity on the system (referred to as variable capacity)that must be paid for only to the extent the owner’s dedicated production exceeds that owner’s demand capacity.  KMP serves as the managing member of Fort Union.  Western Gas Wyoming, L.L.C., a subsidiary of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, acts as field operator, and a ONEOK Partners subsidiary acts as administrative manager and provides gas control, contract management and contract invoicing services.



KMP Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines



TGP



KMP’s subsidiary, TGP, owns the approximate 11,840-mile Tennessee Gas natural gas pipeline system.  The system has a design capacity of approximately 8.5 BCF/d for natural gas, and during 2013 the average transport volume was 7,082 BBtu/d. The multiple-line TGP system begins in the natural gas producing regions of Louisiana, the Gulf of Mexico and South Texas and extends to the northeast section of the U.S., including the metropolitan areas of New York City and Boston.



KMP’s TGP system connects with multiple pipelines (including interconnects at the U.S.-Mexico border and the U.S.-Canada border) that provide customers with access to diverse sources of supply and various natural gas markets.  The pipeline system is also connected to four major shale formations: (i) the Haynesville shale formation in northern Louisiana and Texas; (ii) the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania; (iii) the Utica shale formation that spans an area from Ohio to Pennsylvania; and (iv) the previously discussed Eagle Ford shale formation located in South Texas.  The TGP system also includes approximately 94 Bcf of underground working natural gas storage capacity through partially owned facilities or long-term contracts.  Of this total storage capacity, 29.6 Bcf is contracted from Bear Creek located in Bienville Parish, Louisiana.  Bear Creek is a joint venture equally owned by KMP and EPB. The facility has 59.2 bcf of working natural gas storage capacity that is committed equally to KMP and EPB.



KMP’s TGP pipeline system provides natural gas services to a variety of customers, including natural gas distribution and industrial companies, electric generation companies, natural gas producers, other natural gas pipelines and natural gas marketing and trading companies.  Its existing transportation and storage contracts expire at various times and in varying amounts of throughput capacity, and TGP’s ability to extend its existing customer contracts or remarket expiring contracted capacity is dependent on competitive alternatives, the regulatory environment at the federal, state and local levels and market supply and demand factors at the relevant dates these contracts are extended or expire.  The duration of new or renegotiated contracts will be affected by current prices, competitive conditions and judgments concerning future market trends and volatility.

Competition



The market for supply of natural gas is highly competitive, and new pipelines are currently being built to serve the growing demand for natural gas in each of the markets served by the pipelines in our Natural Gas Pipelines business segment.  These operations compete with interstate and intrastate pipelines, and their shippers, for connections to new markets and supplies and for transportation, processing and treating services.  We believe the principal elements of competition in our various markets are transportation rates, terms of service and flexibility and reliability of service.  From time to time, other pipeline projects are proposed that would compete with our pipelines, and some proposed pipelines may deliver natural gas to markets we serve from new supply sources closer to those markets.  We do not know whether or when any such projects would be built, or the extent of their impact on our operations or profitability.



Shippers on our natural gas pipelines compete with other forms of energy available to their natural gas customers and end users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils.  Several factors influence the demand for natural gas, including price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation and governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and weather.

Combined, West Coast Products Pipelines operations’ pipelines transport approximately 1.2 MMBbl/d of refined petroleum products, providing pipeline service to approximately 28 customer-owned terminals, 10 commercial airports and 15 military bases.The pipeline systems serve approximately 60 shippers in the refined petroleum products market, the largest customers being major petroleum companies, independent refiners, and the U.S. military.  The majority of refined products supplied to the West Coast Product Pipelines come from the major refining centers around Los Angeles, San Francisco, West Texas and from waterborne terminals and connecting pipelines located near these refining centers.



Plantation Pipe Line Company



KMP owns approximately 51% of Plantation, the sole owner of the approximately 3,100-mile refined petroleum products Plantation pipeline system serving the southeastern U.S.  KMP operates the system pursuant to agreements with Plantation and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Plantation Services LLC.  The Plantation pipeline system originates in Louisiana and terminates in the Washington, D.C. area.  It connects to approximately 130 shipper delivery terminals throughout eight states and serves as a common carrier of refined petroleum products to various metropolitan areas, including Birmingham, Alabama; Atlanta, Georgia; Charlotte, North Carolina; and the Washington, D.C. area.  An affiliate of ExxonMobil Corporation owns the remaining approximately 49% ownership interest, and ExxonMobil has historically been one of the largest shippers on the Plantation system both in terms of volumes and revenues.  In 2013, Plantation delivered approximately 576,600 Bbl/d of refined petroleum products, with the product mix being approximately 71% gasoline, 17% diesel fuel, and 12% jet fuel.










Products shipped on Plantation originate at various Gulf Coast refineries from which major integrated oil companies and independent refineries and wholesalers ship refined petroleum products, from other products pipeline systems, and via marine facilities located along the Mississippi River.  Plantation ships products for approximately 40 companies to terminals throughout the southeastern U.S.  Plantation’s principal customers are Gulf Coast refining and marketing companies, and fuel wholesalers.



Central Florida Pipeline



KMP’s Central Florida pipeline system consists of a 110-mile, 16-inch diameter pipeline that transports gasoline and ethanol, and an 85-mile, 10-inch diameter pipeline that transports diesel fuel and jet fuel from Tampa to Orlando.  The Central Florida pipeline operations also include two separate liquids terminals located in Tampa and Taft, Florida, which KMP owns and operates.



In addition to being connected to the Tampa terminal, the Central Florida pipeline system is connected to terminals owned and operated by TransMontaigne, Citgo, Buckeye, and Marathon Petroleum.  The 10-inch diameter pipeline is connected to the Taft terminal (located near Orlando), has an intermediate delivery point at Intercession City, Florida, and is also the sole pipeline supplying jet fuel to the Orlando International Airport in Orlando, Florida.  In 2013, the pipeline system transported approximately 95,400 Bbl/d of refined products, with the product mix being approximately71% gasoline and ethanol,10% diesel fuel, and19% jet fuel.



The Tampa terminal contains approximately 1.6 MMBbl of refined products storage capacity and is connected to two ship dock facilities in the Port of Tampa and is also connected to an ethanol unit train off-load facility.  The Taft terminal contains approximately 0.8 MMBbl of storage capacity, for gasoline, ethanol and diesel fuel for further movement into trucks.



Cochin Pipeline System



KMP’s Cochin pipeline system consists of an approximately 1,900-mile, 12-inch diameter multi-product pipeline operating between Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta and Windsor, Ontario, along with five terminals.  The pipeline operates on a batched basis and has an estimated system capacity of 50 MBbl/d.  It includes 31 pump stations spaced at 60 mile intervals and five U.S. propane terminals.  Underground storage is available at Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta and Windsor, Ontario through third parties.  The pipeline traverses three provinces in Canada and seven states in the U.S. and can transport ethane, propane, butane and NGL to the midwestern U.S. and eastern Canadian petrochemical and fuel markets.  In 2013, the system transported approximately 33 MBbl/d of propane, and 16.4 MBbl/d of ethane-propane mix.  In mid-2014, KMP expects to complete the expansion and reversal of the Cochin pipeline system to transport 95 MBbl/d of condensate from a new receipt terminal in Kankakee County, Illinois to third party storage in Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.



Cypress Pipeline



KMP owns 50% of Cypress Interstate Pipeline LLC, the sole owner of the Cypress pipeline system.  KMP operates the system pursuant to a long-term agreement.  The Cypress pipeline is an interstate common carrier NGL pipeline originating at storage facilities in Mont Belvieu, Texas and extending 104 miles east to a connection with Westlake Chemical Corporation, a major petrochemical producer in the Lake Charles, Louisiana area.  Mont Belvieu, located approximately 20 miles east of Houston, is the largest hub for NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation and storage in the U.S.  The Cypress pipeline system has a current capacity of approximately 55 MBbl/d for NGL.  In 2013, the system transported approximately 52.8 MBbl/d.



Southeast Terminals



KMP’s Southeast terminal operations consist of 28 high-quality, liquid petroleum products terminals located along the Plantation/Colonial pipeline corridor in the Southeastern U.S.  The marketing activities of the Southeast terminal operations are focused on the Southeastern U.S. from Mississippi through Virginia, including Tennessee.  The primary function involves the receipt of petroleum products from common carrier pipelines, short-term storage in terminal tankage, and subsequent loading onto tank trucks.  Combined, the Southeast terminals have a total storage capacity of approximately 9.1 MMBbl. In 2013, these terminals transferred approximately 418.1 MBbl/d of refined products and together handled 15.8 MMBbl of ethanol.



Transmix Operations



KMP’s Transmix operations include the processing of petroleum pipeline transmix, a blend of dissimilar refined petroleum products that have become co-mingled in the pipeline transportation process.  During pipeline transportation, different products








are transported through the pipelines abutting each other, and generate a volume of different mixed products called transmix.  KMP processes and separates pipeline transmix into pipeline-quality gasoline and light distillate products at six separate processing facilities located in Colton, California; Richmond, Virginia; Dorsey Junction, Maryland; Indianola, Pennsylvania; St. Louis, Missouri; and Greensboro, North Carolina.  Combined, these transmix facilities handled approximately 11.3 MMBbl in 2013.



Kinder Morgan Crude & Condensate Pipeline



The Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate Pipeline is a Texas intrastate pipeline that transports crude oil and condensate from the Eagle Ford shale field in South Texas to the Houston ship channel refining complex.  The 24-to-30-inch pipeline currently originates in Dewitt County, Texas, and extends approximately 178 miles to third party storage.  It delivers product to multiple terminaling facilities that provide access to local refineries, petrochemical plants and docks along the Texas Gulf Coast.  The pipeline operates on a batch basis and has a capacity of 300 MBbl/d.  In 2013, the pipeline system transported approximately 8.8 MMBbl.  Due to strong interest for transportation of Eagle Ford crude and condensate to the Houston Ship Channel, KMP has secured long-term commitments for more than two-thirds of the 300 MBbl/d of capacity on the pipeline.



Double Eagle Pipeline LLC



As part of KMP’s May 1, 2013 Copano acquisition, it acquired a 50% ownership interest in Double Eagle Pipeline LLC, the sole owner of the Double Eagle pipeline system.  Double Eagle pipeline system provides crude oil and condensate gathering and transportation services for Eagle Ford shale gas producers.  The remaining 50% ownership interest in Double Eagle is owned by Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P.  KMP operates the approximate 195-mile Double Eagle pipeline system which consists of three segments (i) a 73-mile line that extends from Three Rivers, Texas, in Live Oak County, Texas to Magellan’s Corpus Christi terminal; (ii) a 37-mile line that extends from northern Karnes County Texas to Three Rivers; and (iii) an 85-mile line that extends from Gardendale, Texas, in LaSalle County to Three Rivers.  The Double Eagle joint venture operations also include a truck unloading facility and a 400 MBbl storage facility located along the pipeline near Three Rivers for deliveries and storage of condensate destined for Corpus Christi.  Combined, the pipeline system has a capacity of 100 MBbl/d, but can be expanded to approximately 150 MBbl/d, and is supported by long-term customer commitments from Talisman Energy USA Inc. and Statoil Marketing and Trading (US) Inc.



Competition



KMP’s Products Pipelines’ pipeline operations compete against proprietary pipelines owned and operated by major oil companies, other independent products pipelines, trucking and marine transportation firms (for short-haul movements of products) and railcars.  The Products Pipelines’ terminal operations compete with proprietary terminals owned and operated by major oil companies and other independent terminal operators, and KMP’s transmix operations compete with refineries owned by major oil companies and independent transmix facilities.





Terminals—KMP



KMP’s Terminals segment includes the operations of its petroleum, chemical and other liquids terminal facilities (other than those included in the Products Pipelines—KMPsegment) and all of its coal, petroleum coke, fertilizer, steel, ores and other dry-bulk material services facilities, including all transload, engineering, conveying and other in-plant services.  Combined, the segment is composed of approximately122 owned or operated liquids and bulk terminal facilities and approximately 10 rail transloading and materials handling facilities.  KMP’s terminals are located throughout the U.S. and in portions of Canada.  KMP believes the location of its facilities and its ability to provide flexibility to customers helps keep customers at its terminals and provides KMP opportunities for expansion.  KMP often classifies its terminal operations based on the handling of either liquids or bulk material products.



Liquids Terminals



KMPs liquids terminals operations primarily store refined petroleum products, petrochemicals, ethanol, industrial chemicals and vegetable oil products in above-ground storage tanks and transfer products to and from pipelines, vessels, tank trucks, tank barges, and tank railcars.  Combined, KMP’s approximately 40 liquids terminals facilities possess liquids storage capacity of approximately 68.1 MMBbl, and in 2013, these terminals handled approximately 618.9 MMBbl of liquids products, including petroleum products, ethanol and chemicals.










Bulk Terminals



KMPs bulk terminal operations primarily involve dry-bulk material handling services.  KMP also provides conveyor manufacturing and installation, engineering and design services, and in-plant services covering material handling, conveying, maintenance and repair, truck-railcar-marine transloading, railcar switching and miscellaneous marine services.  KMP owns or operates approximately 82 dry-bulk terminals in the U.S. and Canada, and combined, its dry-bulk and material transloading facilities (described below) handled approximately 89.9 million tons of coal, petroleum coke, fertilizers, steel, ores and other dry-bulk materials in 2013.



Materials Services (rail transloading)



KMP’s materials services operations include rail or truck transloading shipments from one medium of transportation to another conducted at approximately 10 owned and non-owned facilities.  The Burlington Northern Santa Fe, CSX, Norfolk Southern, Union Pacific, Kansas City Southern and A&W railroads provide rail service for these terminal facilities.  Approximately 50% of the products handled are liquids, including an entire spectrum of liquid chemicals, and the rest are dry-bulk products.  Many of the facilities are equipped for bi-modal operation (rail-to-truck, and truck-to-rail) or connect via pipeline to storage facilities.  Several facilities provide railcar storage services.  KMP also designs and builds transloading facilities, performs inventory management services, and provides value-added services such as blending, heating and sparging.



Effective March 31, 2013, TRANSFLO, a wholly owned subsidiary of CSX, elected to terminate their contract with KMP’s materials handling wholly-owned subsidiary, Kinder Morgan Materials Services (KMMS).  This contract covered 25 terminals located on the CSX Railroad throughout the southeastern section of the U.S.  KMMS performed transloading services at the 25 terminals, which included rail-to-truck and truck-to-rail transloading of bulk and liquid products.



Competition



KMP is one of the largest independent operators of liquids terminals in the U.S, based on barrels of liquids terminaling capacity.  Its liquids terminals compete with other publicly or privately held independent liquids terminals, and terminals owned by oil, chemical and pipeline companies.  Its bulk terminals compete with numerous independent terminal operators, terminals owned by producers and distributors of bulk commodities, stevedoring companies and other industrial companies opting not to outsource terminal services.  In some locations, competitors are smaller, independent operators with lower cost structures.  KMP’s rail transloading (material services) operations compete with a variety of single- or multi-site transload, warehouse and terminal operators across the U.S.  its ethanol rail transload operations compete with a variety of ethanol handling terminal sites across the U.S., many offering waterborne service, truck loading, and unit train capability serviced by Class 1 rail carriers.





Kinder Morgan Canada—KMP



KMP’s Kinder Morgan Canada business segment includes Trans Mountain pipeline system and a 25-mile Jet Fuel pipeline system.



Trans Mountain Pipeline System



The Trans Mountain pipeline system originates at Edmonton, Alberta and transports crude oil and refined petroleum products to destinations in the interior and on the west coast of British Columbia.  The Trans Mountain pipeline is 715 miles in length.  KMP also owns a connecting pipeline that delivers crude oil to refineries in the state of Washington.  The capacity of the line at Edmonton ranges from 300 MBbl/d when heavy crude oil represents 20% of the total throughput (which is a historically normal heavy crude oil percentage), to 400 MBbl/d with no heavy crude oil.



The crude oil and refined petroleum products transported through Trans Mountain pipeline system originate in Alberta and British Columbia.  The refined and partially refined petroleum products transported to Kamloops, British Columbia and Vancouver originate from oil refineries located in Edmonton, Alberta.  Petroleum products delivered through Trans Mountain’s pipeline system are used in markets in British Columbia, Washington State and elsewhere offshore.  In 2013, the Trans Mountain pipeline system delivered an average of 264 MBbl/d. In February 2013, Trans Mountain completed negotiations with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers for a new negotiated toll settlement effective for the period beginning January 1, 2013 and ending December 31, 2015.  The NEB approved the toll settlement in April 2013. The 2013-2015 negotiated settlement contains provisions for extension of the settlement that would likely cause the 2013-2015 settlement to be extended to the completion of the expansion of Trans Mountain at the end of 2017.  In 2012, Trans Mountain succeeded in contracting approximately 80% of its total planned capacity based on a $5.4 billion expansion of the Trans Mountain pipeline








from 300 MBbl to 890 MBbl, based on 15 and 20 year take or pay contracts.  In May 2013, the NEB approved the commercial terms of the expansion agreement.  On December 16, 2013, Trans Mountain filed its application for a Certificate of Public need, including NEB approval on all remaining aspects of the project. The regulatory process is expected to be completed in the middle of 2015.



Trans Mountain also operates a 5.3 mile spur line from its Sumas Pump Station to the U.S. - Canada international border where it connects with KMP’s approximate 63-mile, 16-inch to 20-inch diameter Puget Sound pipeline system.  The Puget Sound pipeline system in the state of Washington has a sustainable throughput capacity of approximately 180 MBbl/d when heavy crude oil represents approximately 5% of throughput, and it connects to four refineries located in northwestern Washington State.  The volumes of crude oil shipped to the state of Washington fluctuate in response to the price levels of Canadian crude oil in relation to crude oil produced in Alaska and other offshore sources and in response to available capacity on the Trans Mountain system.



Jet Fuel Pipeline System



KMP also owns and operates the approximate 25-mile aviation fuel pipeline that serves the Vancouver International Airport, located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.  The turbine fuel pipeline is referred to in this report as the Jet Fuel pipeline system.  In addition to its receiving and storage facilities located at the Westridge Marine terminal, located in Port Metro Vancouver, the Jet Fuel pipeline system’s operations include a terminal at the Vancouver airport that consists of five jet fuel storage tanks with an overall capacity of 15 MBbl.



Competition



Trans Mountain is one of several pipeline alternatives for western Canadian crude oil and refined petroleum production, and it competes against other pipeline providers; however, it is the sole pipeline carrying crude oil and refined petroleum products from Alberta to the west coast.  Furthermore, as demonstrated by KMP’s previously announced expansion proposal, discussed above in “-(a) General Development of Business-Recent Developments-Kinder Morgan Canada,” it believes that the Trans Mountain pipeline facilities provide it the opportunity to execute on capacity expansions to the west coast as the market for offshore exports continues to develop.



In December, 2013 the British Columbia Ministry of Environment granted approval for a new, airport fuel consortium owned, jet fuel terminal to be located near the Vancouver International Airport. The impact of this facility on our existing Jet Fuel pipeline system is uncertain at this time.





Other



During 2013, our other segment activities include those operations that were acquired from EP on May 25, 2012 and are primarily related to several physical natural gas contracts with power plants associated with EP’s legacy trading activities. These contracts obligate EP to sell natural gas to these plants and have various expiration dates ranging from 2012 to 2028.  This segment also included an interest in the Bolivia to Brazil Pipeline, which we sold for $88 million on January 18, 2013.





Major Customers



Our revenue is derived from a wide customer base.For each of the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, no revenues from transactions with a single external customer accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues. KMP’s Texas intrastate natural gas pipeline group buys and sells significant volumes of natural gas within the state of Texas, and, to a far lesser extent, the CO2-KMP business segment also sells natural gas.   Combined, total revenues from the sales of natural gas from the Natural Gas Pipelines and CO2-KMP business segments in 2013, 2012 and 2011 accounted for 28%, 28% and 42%, respectively, of our total consolidated revenues.  To the extent possible, we attempt to balance the pricing and timing of its natural gas purchases to its natural gas sales, and these contracts are often settled in terms of an index price for both purchases and sales.  We do not believe that a loss of revenues from any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.












Regulation

Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation - U.S. Operations

Some of our U.S. refined petroleum products and crude oil pipelines are interstate common carrier pipelines, subject to regulation by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, or ICA.  The ICA requires that we maintain our tariffs on file with the FERC.  Those tariffs set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines as well as the rules and regulations governing these services.  The ICA requires, among other things, that such rates on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable” and nondiscriminatory.  The ICA permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the FERC to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate such rates.  If, upon completion of an investigation, the FERC finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful, it is authorized to require the carrier to refund the revenues in excess of the prior tariff collected during the pendency of the investigation.  The FERC also may investigate, upon complaint or on its own motion, rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively.  Upon an appropriate showing, a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained during the two years prior to the filing of a complaint.

On October 24, 1992, Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992.  The Energy Policy Act deemed petroleum products pipeline tariff rates that were in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of enactment or that were in effect on the 365th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint, protest or investigation during the 365-day period to be just and reasonable or “grandfathered” under the ICA.  The Energy Policy Act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates.  Certain rates on KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipeline system were subject to protest during the 365-day period established by the Energy Policy Act.  Accordingly, certain of the Pacific pipelines’ rates have been, and continue to be, the subject of complaints with the FERC, as is more fully described in Note 16 “Litigation, Environmental and Other” to our consolidated financial statements.

Petroleum products pipelines may change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index.  Shippers may protest rate increases made within the ceiling levels, but such protests must show that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s increase in costs from the previous year.  A pipeline must, as a general rule, utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates.  Cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates are alternatives to the indexing approach and may be used in certain specified circumstances to change rates.

Common Carrier Pipeline Rate Regulation - Canadian Operations

The Canadian portion of our crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline systems is under the regulatory jurisdiction of the NEB.  The National Energy Board Act gives the NEB power to authorize pipeline construction and to establish tolls and conditions of service.  Our subsidiary Trans Mountain Pipeline, L.P. is the sole owner of our Trans Mountain crude oil and refined petroleum products pipeline system.

The toll charged for the portion of Trans Mountain’s pipeline system located in the U.S. falls under the jurisdiction of the FERC.  For further information, see “-Interstate Common Carrier Refined Petroleum Products and Oil Pipeline Rate Regulation - U.S. Operations” above.

Interstate Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Regulation

Posted tariff rates set the general range of maximum and minimum rates we charge shippers on our interstate natural gas pipelines.  Within that range, each pipeline is permitted to charge discounted rates to meet competition, so long as such discounts are offered to all similarly situated shippers and granted without undue discrimination.  Apart from discounted rates offered within the range of tariff maximums and minimums, the pipeline is permitted to offer negotiated rates where the pipeline and shippers want rate certainty, irrespective of changes that may occur to the range of tariff-based maximum and minimum rate levels.  Negotiated rates provide certainty to the pipeline and the shipper of a fixed rate during the term of the transportation agreement, regardless of changes to the posted tariff rates.  There are a variety of rates that different shippers may pay, and while rates may vary by shipper and circumstance, the terms and conditions of pipeline transportation and storage services are not generally negotiable.

The FERC regulates the rates, terms and conditions of service, construction and abandonment of facilities by companies performing interstate natural gas transportation services, including storage services, under the Natural Gas Act of 1938.  To a lesser extent, the FERC regulates interstate transportation rates, terms and conditions of service under the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978.  Beginning in the mid-1980’s, through the mid-1990’s, the FERC initiated a number of regulatory changes










intended to create a more competitive environment in the natural gas marketplace. Among the most important of these changes were:

•Order No. 436 (1985) which required open-access, nondiscriminatory transportation of natural gas;

•Order No. 497 (1988) which set forth new standards and guidelines imposing certain constraints on the interaction between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing affiliates and imposing certain disclosure requirements regarding that interaction; and

•Order No. 636 (1992) which required interstate natural gas pipelines that perform open-access transportation under blanket certificates to “unbundle” or separate their traditional merchant sales services from their transportation and storage services and to provide comparable transportation and storage services with respect to all natural gas supplies.  Natural gas pipelines must now separately state the applicable rates for each unbundled service they provide (i.e., for the natural gas commodity, transportation and storage).

The FERC standards of conduct address and clarify multiple issues, including (i) the definition of transmission function and transmission function employees; (ii) the definition of marketing function and marketing function employees; (iii) the definition of transmission function information; (iv) independent functioning; (v) transparency; and (vi) the interaction of FERC standards with the North American Energy Standards Board business practice standards. The FERC also promulgates certain standards of conduct that apply uniformly to interstate natural gas pipelines and public utilities.  In light of the changing structure of the energy industry, these standards of conduct govern employee relationships-using a functional approach-to ensure that natural gas transmission is provided on a nondiscriminatory basis. Pursuant to the FERC’s standards of conduct, a natural gas transmission provider is prohibited from disclosing to a marketing function employee non-public information about the transmission system or a transmission customer.  Additionally, no-conduit provisions prohibit a transmission function provider from disclosing non-public information to marketing function employees by using a third party conduit.

Rules also require that a transmission provider provide annual training on the standards of conduct to all transmission function employees, marketing function employees, officers, directors, supervisory employees, and any other employees likely to become privy to transmission function information.

In addition to regulatory changes initiated by the FERC, the U.S. Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Among other things, the Energy Policy Act amended the Natural Gas Act to: (i) prohibit market manipulation by any entity; (ii) direct the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the market for sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce; and (iii) significantly increase the penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, or FERC rules, regulations or orders thereunder.

CPUC Rate Regulation

The intrastate common carrier operations of KMP’s Pacific operations’ pipelines in California are subject to regulation by the CPUC under a “depreciated book plant” methodology, which is based on an original cost measure of investment.  Intrastate tariffs filed by KMP with the CPUC have been established on the basis of revenues, expenses and investments allocated as applicable to the California intrastate portion of the Pacific operations’ business.  Tariff rates with respect to intrastate pipeline service in California are subject to challenge by complaint by interested parties or by independent action of the CPUC.  A variety of factors can affect the rates of return permitted by the CPUC, and certain other issues similar to those which have arisen with respect to KMP’s FERC regulated rates also could arise with respect to its intrastate rates.  Certain of the Pacific operations’ pipeline rates have been, and continue to be, subject to complaints with the CPUC, as is more fully described in Note 16 “Litigation, Environmental and Other” to our consolidated financial statements.

Texas Railroad Commission Rate Regulation

The intrastate operations of our natural gas and crude oil pipelines in Texas are subject to regulation with respect to such intrastate transportation by the Texas Railroad Commission.  The Texas Railroad Commission has the authority to regulate our transportation rates, though it generally has not investigated the rates or practices of our intrastate pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints.

Mexico - Energy Regulating Commission



The Mier-Monterrey Pipeline has a natural gas transportation permit granted by the Energy Regulating Commission (the Commission) that defines the general and directional conditions for the pipeline to carry out activity and provide natural gas transportation service.  This permit expires in 2032.












This permit establishes certain restrictive conditions, including without limitations (i) compliance with the general conditions for the provision of natural gas transportation service; (ii) compliance with certain safety measures, contingency plans, maintenance plans and the official Mexican standards regarding safety; (iii) compliance with the technical and economic specifications of the project presented to the Commission; (iv) compliance with certain technical studies established by the Commission; and (v) compliance with a minimum contributed capital not entitled to withdrawal of at least the equivalent of 10% of the investment proposed in the project.



Safety Regulation



We are also subject to safety regulations imposed by the Department of Transportation PHMSA, including those requiring us to develop and maintain integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along our pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in what are referred to as high consequence areas, or HCAs, where a leak or rupture could potentially do the most harm.



The ultimate costs of compliance with the integrity management rules are difficult to predict. Changes such as advances of in-line inspection tools, identification of additional threats to a pipeline’s integrity and changes to the amount of pipe determined to be located in HCAs can have a significant impact on the costs to perform integrity testing and repairs. We plan to continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity of our existing and future pipelines as required by the Department of Transportation rules. The results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our pipelines.





From time to time, our pipelines may experience leaks and ruptures. These leaks and ruptures may cause explosions, fire, damage to the environment, damage to property and/or personal injury or death. In connection with these incidents, we may be sued for damages caused by an alleged failure to properly mark the locations of our pipelines and/or to properly maintain our pipelines. Depending upon the facts and circumstances of a particular incident, state and federal regulatory authorities may seek civil and/or criminal fines and penalties.



We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and other comparable federal and state agencies that address employee health and safety.  In general, we believe current expenditures are addressing the OSHA requirements and protecting the health and safety of our employees.  Based on new regulatory developments, we may increase expenditures in the future to comply with higher industry and regulatory safety standards.  However, such increases in our expenditures, and the extent to which they might be offset, cannot be estimated at this time.



State and Local Regulation



Our activities are subject to various state and local laws and regulations, as well as orders of regulatory bodies, governing a wide variety of matters, including marketing, production, pricing, pollution, protection of the environment, and human health and safety.



Marine Operations



The operation of tankers and marine equipment create maritime obligations involving property, personnel and cargo under General Maritime Law. These obligations create a variety of risks including, among other things, the risk of collision, which










may precipitate claims for personal injury, cargo, contract, pollution, third party claims and property damages to vessels and facilities.



KMP is subject to the Jones Act and other federal laws that restrict maritime transportation (between U.S. departure and destination points) to vessels built and registered in the U.S. and owned and manned by U.S. citizens. As a result, KMP monitors the foreign ownership of its ownership interests. If KMP does not comply with such requirements, it would be prohibited from operating its vessels in U.S. coastwise trade, and under certain circumstances KMP would be deemed to have undertaken an unapproved foreign transfer, resulting in severe penalties, including permanent loss of U.S. coastwise trading rights for its vessels, fines or forfeiture of the vessels.



In addition, the U.S. Coast Guard and the American Bureau of Shipping maintain the most stringent regime of vessel inspection in the world, which tends to result in higher regulatory compliance costs for U.S.-flag operators than for owners of vessels registered under foreign flags of convenience. The Jones Act and General Maritime Law also provide damage remedies for crew members injured in the service of the vessel arising from employer negligence or vessel unseaworthiness.



The Merchant Marine Act of 1936 is a federal law that provides, upon proclamation by the U.S. President of a national emergency or a threat to the national security, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation the authority to requisition or purchase any vessel or other watercraft owned by U.S. citizens (including KMP, provided that KMP is considered a U.S. citizen for this purpose). If one of its vessels were purchased or requisitioned by the U.S. government under this law, KMP would be entitled to be paid the fair market value of the vessel in the case of a purchase or, in the case of a requisition, the fair market value of charter hire. However, KMP would not be entitled to compensation for any consequential damages suffered as a result of such purchase or requisition.





Environmental Matters



Our business operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, pollution and human health and safety in the U.S. and Canada.  For example, if an accidental leak, release or spill of liquid petroleum products, chemicals or other hazardous substances occurs at or from our pipelines, or at or from our storage or other facilities, we may experience significant operational disruptions, and we may have to pay a significant amount to clean up the leak, release or spill, pay for government penalties, address natural resource damages, compensate for human exposure or property damage, install costly pollution control equipment or a combination of these and other measures.  Furthermore, new projects may require approvals and environmental analysis under federal and state laws, including the National Environmental Policy Act and the Endangered Species Act.  The resulting costs and liabilities could materially and negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  In addition, emission controls required under federal, state and provincial environmental laws could require significant capital expenditures at our facilities.



Environmental and human health and safety laws and regulations are subject to change.  The clear trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to affect the environment, wildlife, natural resources and human health.  There can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental regulation compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate.  Revised or additional regulations that result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.



In accordance with GAAP, we accrue liabilities for environmental matters when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated.  This policy applies to assets or businesses currently owned or previously disposed.  We have accrued liabilities for estimable and probable environmental remediation obligations at various sites, including multi-party sites where the EPA, or similar state or Canadian agency has identified us as one of the potentially responsible parties.  The involvement of other financially responsible companies at these multi-party sites could increase or mitigate our actual joint and several liability exposures.



We believe that the ultimate resolution of these environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  However, it is possible that our ultimate liability with respect to these environmental matters could exceed the amounts accrued in an amount that could be material to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.  We have accrued an environmental reserve in the amount of$378 millionas of December 31, 2013.  Our reserve estimates range in value from approximately$378 millionto approximately$562 million, and we recorded our liability equal to the low end of the range, as we did not identify any amounts within the range as a better estimate of the liability.  For additional information related to environmental matters, see Note 16 “Litigation, Environmental and Other” to our consolidated financial statements.










Hazardous and Non-Hazardous Waste



We generate both hazardous and non-hazardous wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state and Canadian statutes.  From time to time, the EPA and state and Canadian regulators consider the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non‑hazardous waste.  Furthermore, it is possible that some wastes that are currently classified as non-hazardous, which could include wastes currently generated during our pipeline or liquids or bulk terminal operations, may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes.  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly handling and disposal requirements than non-hazardous wastes.  Such changes in the regulations may result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses for us.



Superfund



The CERCLA or the Superfund law, and analogous state laws, impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of potentially responsible persons for releases of hazardous substances into the environment.  These persons include the owner or operator of a site and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site.  CERCLA authorizes the EPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.  Although petroleum is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of a hazardous substance, in the course of our ordinary operations, we have and will generate materials that may fall within the definition of hazardous substance.  By operation of law, if we are determined to be a potentially responsible person, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which such materials are present, in addition to compensation for natural resource damages, if any.



Clean Air Act



Our operations are subject to the Clean Air Act, its implementing regulations, and analogous state and Canadian statutes and regulations.  We believe that the operations of our pipelines, storage facilities and terminals are in substantial compliance with such statutes.  The EPA regulations under the Clean Air Act contain requirements for the monitoring, reporting, and control of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources.   For further information, see “-Climate Change” below.



Clean Water Act



Our operations can result in the discharge of pollutants.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into waters of the U.S.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by applicable federal, state or Canadian authorities.  The Oil Pollution Act was enacted in 1990 and amends provisions of the Clean Water Act pertaining to prevention and response to oil spills.  Spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of the Clean Water Act and some state and Canadian laws require containment and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an overflow or release of oil.



Climate Change



Studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as greenhouse gases, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere.  Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and CO2, which is naturally occurring and also a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases.   Various laws and regulations exist or are under development that seek to regulate the emission of such greenhouse gases, including the EPA programs to control greenhouse gas emissions and state actions to develop statewide or regional programs. The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.



Beginning in December 2009, EPA published several findings and rulemakings under the Clean Air Act requiring the

permitting and reporting of certain greenhouse gases including CO2 and methane. Our facilities are subject to substantial compliance with these requirements. Operational and/or regulatory changes could require additional facilities to comply with greenhouse gas emissions reporting and permitting requirements. Additionally, the EPA has announced that it will propose new regulations of greenhouse gases which may impose further requirements, including emission control requirements, on Kinder Morgan facilities.



At the state level, more than one-third of the states, either individually or through multi-state regional initiatives, already








have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of emission inventories or regional greenhouse gas “cap and trade” programs. Although many of the state-level initiatives have to date been focused on large sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as electric power plants, it is possible that sources such as our gas-fired compressors and processing plants could become subject to related state regulations. Various states are also proposing or have implemented more strict regulations for greenhouse gases that go beyond the requirements of the EPA. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to conduct monitoring, do additional emissions reporting and/or purchase and surrender emission allowances.



Because our and our subsidiaries operations, including the compressor stations and processing plants, emit various types of greenhouse gases, primarily methane and CO2, such new legislation or regulation could increase the costs related to operating and maintaining the facilities. Depending on the particular law, regulation or program, we or our subsidiaries could be required to incur capital expenditures for installing new monitoring equipment of emission controls on the facilities, acquire and surrender allowances for the greenhouse gas emissions, pay taxes related to the greenhouse gas emissions and administer and manage a greenhouse gas emissions program.  We are not able at this time to estimate such increased costs; however, as is the case with similarly situated entities in the industry they could be significant to us.  While we may be able to include some or all of such increased costs in the rates charged by our or our subsidiaries pipelines, such recovery of costs in all cases is uncertain and may depend on events beyond their control including the outcome of future rate proceedings before the FERC or other regulatory bodies and the provisions of any final legislation or other regulations.  Any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and prospects.



Some climatic models indicate that global warming is likely to result in rising sea levels, increased intensity of hurricanes and tropical storms, and increased frequency of extreme precipitation and flooding.  We may experience increased insurance premiums and deductibles, or a decrease in available coverage, for our assets in areas subject to severe weather.  To the extent these phenomena occur, they could damage our physical assets, especially operations located in low-lying areas near coasts and river banks, and facilities situated in hurricane-prone regions.  However, the timing and location of these climate change impacts is not known with any certainty and, in any event, these impacts are expected to manifest themselves over a long time horizon.  Thus, we are not in a position to say whether the physical impacts of climate change pose a material risk to our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Because natural gas emits less greenhouse gas emissions per unit of energy than competing fossil fuels, cap-and-trade legislation or EPA regulatory initiatives could stimulate demand for natural gas by increasing the relative cost of fuels such as coal and oil.  In addition, we anticipate that greenhouse gas regulations will increase demand for carbon sequestration technologies, such as the techniques we have successfully demonstrated in our enhanced oil recovery operations within our CO2-KMP business segment.  However, these positive effects on our markets may be offset if these same regulations also cause the cost of natural gas to increase relative to competing non-fossil fuels.  Although we currently cannot predict the magnitude and direction of these impacts, greenhouse gas regulations could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.



Department of Homeland Security



The Department of Homeland Security, referred to in this report as the DHS, has regulatory authority over security at certain high-risk chemical facilities.  The DHS has promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards and required all high-risk chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and gas facilities, to comply with the regulatory requirements of these standards.  This process includes completing security vulnerability assessments, developing site security plans, and implementing protective measures necessary to meet DHS-defined, risk based performance standards.  The DHS has not provided final notice to all facilities that it determines to be high risk and subject to the rule; therefore, neither the extent to which our facilities may be subject to coverage by the rules nor the associated costs to comply can currently be determined, but it is possible that such costs could be substantial.





Other



Employees



We employed 11,075 full-time people at December 31, 2013, including approximately 828 full-time hourly personnel at certain terminals and pipelines covered by collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2014 and 2018.  We consider relations with our employees to be good.



Most of our employees are employed by a limited number of our subsidiaries and provide services to one or more of our business units (subsidiaries or limited partnerships).  The direct costs of compensation, benefits expenses, employer taxes and








other employer expenses for these employees are allocated to our subsidiaries and limited partnerships. Our human resources department provides the administrative support necessary to implement these payroll and benefits services, and the related administrative costs are allocated to our subsidiaries and limited partnerships pursuant to existing expense allocation procedures.  The effect of these arrangements is that each business unit bears the direct compensation and employee benefits costs of its assigned or partially assigned employees, as the case may be, while also bearing its allocable share of administrative costs.  These processes are in accordance with limited partnership agreements, board of directors’ approved policies and other agreements including the Delegation of Control Agreement among KMGP, KMR, KMP and others.
