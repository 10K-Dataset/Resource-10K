Item 1. Business

PPG Industries, Inc., manufactures and distributes a broad range of coatings, specialty materials and glass products.  The Company, incorporated in Pennsylvania in 1883, is comprised of three reportable business segments: Performance Coatings, Industrial Coatings and Glass. Each of the business segments in which PPG operates is highly competitive. The Company's diversification of product lines and worldwide markets served tends to minimize the impact on PPG’s total net sales and income from continuing operations from changes in demand either for a particular product line or in a particular geographic area.

In November 2014, PPG finalized the acquisition of Consorcio Comex, S.A. de C.V. ("Comex"), an architectural coatings company headquartered in Mexico City, Mexico. The acquisition further expands PPG's global coatings business and adds a leading architectural coatings business in Mexico and Central America. Refer to Note 2, "Acquisitions and Dispositions" under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding this acquisition.

In March 2014, PPG completed the sale of its 51% ownership interest in its Transitions Optical joint venture and 100% of its optical sunlens business to Essilor International (Compagnie Generale D'Optique) SA ("Essilor"). Refer to Note 2, “Acquisitions and Dispositions” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further information relating to this transaction.

In conjunction with the Company’s continued strategic focus on its coatings businesses, including the growth of the Company's global architectural coatings business, as well as the divestiture of its interest in its Transitions Optical joint venture and sunlens business, the Company realigned its segment reporting structure in the quarter ended March 31, 2014.  Under the new segment reporting structure, the Company's reportable business segments changed from the five segments of Performance Coatings, Industrial Coatings, Architectural Coatings-Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), Optical and Specialty Materials and Glass to the three reportable segments noted above. Refer to Note 19, "Reportable Business Segment Information” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for financial information relating to our reportable business segments.

Performance Coatings and Industrial Coatings

Industrial Coatings

The Industrial Coatings reportable segment is comprised of the automotive OEM, industrial coatings, packaging coatings, and specialty coatings and materials businesses. Industrial, automotive OEM, packaging coatings, and specialty coatings and materials products are formulated specifically for the customers’ needs and application methods.

Price, product performance, technology, cost effectiveness, quality and technical and customer service are major competitive factors in the industrial, automotive OEM and packaging coatings businesses.

The industrial and automotive OEM coatings businesses sell directly to a variety of manufacturing companies. PPG also supplies adhesives and sealants for the automotive industry and metal pretreatments and related chemicals for industrial and automotive applications. PPG has established alliances with Kansai Paints and Asian Paints Ltd. to serve certain automotive original equipment manufacturers and aftermarket customers in various regions of the world. PPG owns a 60% interest in PPG Kansai Automotive Finishes to serve Japanese-based automotive OEM customers in North America and Europe. In 2014, PPG acquired the ownership interest of Helios Group, the minority partner in the former PPG-Helios joint venture which serves Russian-based automotive OEM customers in Russia and the Ukraine.

Glass

The Glass reportable business segment is comprised of the flat glass and fiber glass businesses. PPG is a producer of flat glass in North America and a producer of fiber glass in North America and Europe, as well as Asia through our partnership with Nan Ya Plastics Corp to serve the electronics industries.  PPG’s major markets are commercial and residential construction and the wind energy, energy infrastructure, transportation and electronics industries. Most glass products are sold directly to manufacturing companies. PPG manufactures flat glass by the float process and fiber glass by the continuous-strand process.

Price, quality, technology and customer service are the key competitive factors in the glass businesses. The Company competes with several major producers of flat glass, including Asahi Glass Company, Cardinal Glass Industries, Guardian Industries and NSG Pilkington, and many major producers of fiber glass throughout the world, including Owens Corning, Jushi Group, Johns Manville Corporation, CPIC Fiberglass, AGY, NEG, 3B and Taishan Fiberglass. The average number of persons employed by the Glass reportable segment during2014was about 3,100.



Raw Materials and Energy

The effective management of raw materials and energy is important to PPG’s continued success. The Company’s most significant raw materials are epoxy and other resins, titanium dioxide and other pigments, and solvents in the coatings segments; sand and soda ash for the specialty coatings and materials business; and sand, clay and soda ash in the Glass segment. Coatings raw materials, which include both organic, primarily petroleum based, materials and inorganic materials, including titanium dioxide, generally comprise between 70% and 80% of cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization, in most coatings formulations and represent PPG’s single largest production cost component.

Energy is a significant production cost in the Glass segment, and our primary energy source is natural gas. With the separation of the commodity chemicals business in 2013, PPG's consumption of natural gas decreased significantly. Natural gas is expected to remain a competitive fuel source when compared to alternatives, especially on a global basis.  We will continue to use competitive sourcing and consumption reduction initiatives to manage natural gas costs.





102014 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K






Most of the raw materials and energy used in production are purchased from outside sources, and the Company has made, and plans to continue to make, supply arrangements to meet the planned operating requirements for the future. Supply of critical raw materials and energy is managed by establishing contracts, multiple sources, and identifying alternative materials or technology whenever possible.  Our products use both petroleum-derived and bio-based materials as part of a product renewal strategy. While prices for these raw materials typically fluctuate with energy prices, such fluctuations are impacted by the fact that our raw materials are downstream from crude oil and natural gas.

The Company is continuing its aggressive sourcing initiatives to broaden our supply of high quality raw materials. These initiatives include qualifying multiple and local sources of supply, including suppliers from Asia and other lower cost regions of the world and a reduction in the amount of titanium dioxide used in our product formulations.

Our global efforts to reduce titanium dioxide consumption have been successful to date and are expected to continue.  Titanium dioxide is a raw material widely used in the paint and coatings industry as a pigment to provide hiding, durability and whiteness characteristics.  PPG purchases both sulfate-grade and chloride-grade titanium dioxide from suppliers for use in coatings formulations.  The Company has undertaken a strategic initiative to secure and enhance PPG’s supply of titanium dioxide, as well as to add to the global supply of this raw material. PPG possesses intellectual property and expertise in the production and finishing of titanium dioxide pigment and has and intends to continue to leverage this and engage potential parties to develop innovative supply solutions through technical collaborations, joint ventures, licensing or other commercial initiatives.

PPG signed a license agreement with Henan Billions Chemicals Co., Ltd. ("Billions"), under which PPG has licensed certain chloride-based titanium dioxide technologies to Billions for use at Billions’ titanium dioxide refinement facilities in China. In addition, PPG has signed a long-term purchase agreement for titanium dioxide with Billions. In 2014, construction of Billions' titanium dioxide manufacturing and research facility was completed in the Henan Province of China.  The facility is scheduled to begin production in the first half of 2015.  PPG intends to use the chloride-based titanium dioxide manufactured by Billions for various end-use paint and coatings applications. Billions is also able to sell its chloride-based titanium dioxide to third parties.

In 2013, PPG signed a purchase and supply agreement as well as a research services agreement with Argex Titanium Inc. ("Argex") whereby PPG is providing technical support to Argex in connection with their efforts to develop a unique and low cost process to manufacture pigment grade titanium dioxide.

We are subject to existing and evolving standards relating to the registration of chemicals which could potentially impact the availability and viability of some of the raw materials we use in our production processes. Our ongoing global product



stewardship efforts are directed at maintaining our compliance with these standards.

Changes to chemical registration regulations have been proposed or implemented in the EU and many other countries, including China, Canada, the United States, and Korea. Because implementation of many of these programs has not been finalized, the financial impact cannot be estimated at this time. We anticipate that the number of chemical registration regulations will continue to increase globally, and we have implemented programs to track and comply with these regulations.

Given the volatility of certain energy-based input costs at the end of 2014, the Company is negotiating with suppliers on pricing for various raw materials.  Initial discussions have resulted in a slight downward bias on the price of certain oil-derived materials, which account for a portion of the Company’s overall raw material spend.  The Company is also experiencing moderate inflation in certain other raw materials and other expense categories, including employee-related wage and benefit costs.  Given the recent volatility in certain energy-based input costs, the Company is not able to predict with certainty the 2015 full year impact of related changes in raw material pricing.



Research and Development

Technology innovation has been a hallmark of PPG’s success throughout its history. Research and development costs, including depreciation of research facilities, were $509 million, $479 million and $444 million during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These costs totaled approximately 3% of annual sales in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We have obtained government funding of a small portion of the Company's research efforts, and we will continue to pursue government funding where appropriate.

PPG owns and operates several facilities to conduct research and development relating to new and improved products and processes.  In addition to the Company's centralized principal research and development centers (See Item 2 of this Form 10-K), operating segments manage their development regionally through centers of excellence. As part of our ongoing efforts to manage our formulations and raw material costs effectively, we operate a global competitive sourcing laboratory in China. Because of the Company’s broad array of products and customers, PPG is not materially dependent upon any single technology platform.

The Company seeks to optimize its investment in research and development to create new products to drive profitable growth. We align our product development with the macro trends in the end-use markets we serve and leverage core technology platforms to develop products for unmet market needs. Our history of successful technology introductions is based on a commitment to an efficient and effective innovation process and disciplined portfolio management.





2014 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K11








Patents

PPG considers patent protection to be important; however,  the Company’s reportable business segments are not materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. PPG earned $50 million in 2014,$48 millionin 2013 and$51 millionin 2012 from royalties and the sale of technical know-how.



Backlog

In general, PPG does not manufacture its products against a backlog of orders.  Production and inventory levels are geared primarily to projections of future demand and the level of incoming orders.



Global Operations

PPG has a significant investment in non-U.S. operations. This broad geographic footprint serves to lessen the significance of economic impacts occurring in any one region. As a result of our expansion outside the U.S., we are subject to certain inherent risks, including economic and political conditions in international markets and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

Our net sales in the developed and emerging regions of the world for the years ended December 31stare summarized below:

($ in millions)Net Sales201420132012United States, Canada, Western Europe$11,139$10,311$8,767Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East, Africa, Asia Pacific4,2213,9543,919Total$15,360$14,265$12,686

Refer to Note 19 "Reportable Business Segment Information" under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for geographic information related to PPG's property, plant and equipment, and for additional geographic information pertaining to sales.



Seasonality

PPG’s income from continuing operations have typically been greater in the second and third quarters and cash flow from operations has been greatest in the fourth quarter due to end-use market seasonality, primarily in PPG’s architectural coatings businesses.  Demand for PPG’s architectural coatings products is typically strongest in the second and third quarters due to higher home improvement, maintenance and construction activity during the spring and summer months in the U.S., Canada and Europe. The Latin America paint season is strongest in the fourth quarter. These higher activity levels result in higher outstanding receivables that are collected in the fourth quarter generating higher fourth quarter cash flow.





Employee Relations

The average number of persons employed worldwide by PPG during 2014 was about44,400. The Company has numerous collective bargaining agreements throughout the world. We observe local customs, legislation and practice in labor relations when negotiating collective bargaining agreements.  There were no significant work stoppages in 2014. While we have experienced occasional work stoppages as a result of the collective bargaining process and may experience some work stoppages in the future, we believe we will be able to negotiate all labor agreements on satisfactory terms.  To date, these work stoppages have not had a significant impact on PPG’s operating results. Overall, the Company believes it has good relationships with its employees.



Environmental Matters

PPG is subject to existing and evolving standards relating to protection of the environment. PPG is negotiating with various government agencies concerning 126 current and former manufacturing sites and offsite waste disposal locations, including 24 sites on the National Priority List. While PPG is not generally a major contributor of wastes to these offsite waste disposal locations, each potentially responsible party may face governmental agency assertions of joint and several liability. Generally, however, a final allocation of costs is made based on relative contributions of wastes to the site. There is a wide range of cost estimates for cleanup of these sites, due largely to uncertainties as to the nature and extent of their condition and the methods that may have to be employed for their remediation. The Company has established reserves for onsite and offsite remediation of those sites where it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated.

The Company’s experience to date regarding environmental matters leads it to believe that it will have continuing expenditures for compliance with provisions regulating the protection of the environment and for present and future remediation efforts at waste and plant sites. Management anticipates that such expenditures will occur over an extended period of time.

In addition to the $317 million currently reserved for environmental remediation efforts, we may be subject to loss contingencies related to environmental matters estimated to be approximately $75 million to $200 million. These reasonably possible unreserved losses relate to environmental matters at a number of sites. The loss contingencies related to these sites include significant unresolved issues such as the nature and extent of contamination at these sites and the methods that may have to be employed to remediate them.

Capital expenditures for environmental control projects were $14 million, $22 million and $12 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. It is expected that expenditures for such projects in 2015 will be in the range of $30 million to $40 million. Although future capital expenditures are difficult to estimate accurately because of constantly changing regulatory standards and policies, it can be





122014 PPG ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 10-K






anticipated that environmental control standards will become increasingly stringent and the cost of compliance will increase.

In management’s opinion, the Company operates in an environmentally sound manner, is well positioned, relative to environmental matters, within the industries in which it operates and the outcome of these environmental contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on PPG’s financial position or liquidity; however, any such outcome may be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs, if any, are recognized. See Note 13, “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities,” under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information related to environmental matters and our accrued liability for estimated environmental remediation costs.

Public and governmental concerns related to climate change continue to grow, leading to efforts to limit the greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions believed to be responsible.  While PPG has operations in many countries, a substantial portion of PPG’s GHG emissions are generated by locations in the U.S., where considerable legislative and regulatory activity has been taking place. PPG has, and will continue to, annually report our global GHG emissions to the voluntary Carbon Disclosure project.

Energy prices and availability of supply continue to be a concern for major energy users. Since PPG’s GHG emissions arise principally from combustion of fossil fuels, PPG has for some time recognized the desirability of reducing energy consumption and GHG generation. From 2012 to 2013, energy consumption was reduced by 36% and GHG emission generation was reduced by 33%.  PPG's total annual energy consumption and GHG emissions were significantly reduced as a result of the separation of its commodity chemicals business in January 2013.  From 2013 to 2014, energy consumption was reduced by 8% and GHG emission generation was reduced by 10%.

PPG participates in both the U.S. Department of Energy

(“DOE”), BETTER BUILDINGS®, BETTER PLANTS®

program, formerly the Saving Energy Now Leadership program,  and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Energy Star Industrial Partnership program, both reinforcing the company’s voluntary efforts to significantly reduce its industrial energy intensity.  These programs include developing and implementing energy management processes and setting energy savings targets while providing a suite of educational, training, and technical resources to help meet those targets. Recognizing the continuing importance of this matter, PPG has a senior management group with a mandate to guide the Company’s progress in this area.
