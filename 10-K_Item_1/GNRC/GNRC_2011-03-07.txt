History





CCMP transactions



In November 2006, affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC, or CCMP, together with affiliates of Unitas Capital Ltd., or Unitas, and members of our management, purchased an aggregate of $689 million of our equity capital. In addition, on November 10, 2006, Generac Power Systems borrowed an aggregate of $1,380 million, consisting of an initial drawdown of $950 million under a $1.1 billion first lien secured credit facility and $430 million under a $430 million second lien secured credit facility. With the proceeds from these equity and debt financings, together with cash on hand at Generac Power Systems, we (1) acquired all of the capital stock of Generac Power Systems and repaid certain pre-transaction indebtedness of Generac Power Systems for $2.0 billion, (2) paid $66 million in transaction costs related to the transaction and (3) retained $3.0 million for general corporate purposes.



We refer to the foregoing transactions collectively as the “CCMP Transactions.”



Initial public offering and corporate reorganization



On February 17, 2010, we completed our initial public offering (IPO) of 18,750,000 shares of our common stock at a price of $13.00 per share. In addition, on March 18, 2010, the underwriters exercised their option and purchased an additional 1,950,500 shares of our common stock from us. We received approximately $224.1 million in net proceeds at the initial closing, and approximately $23.8 million in net proceeds from the underwriters’ option exercise, after deducting the underwriting discount and total expenses related to the offering. The proceeds from the initial closing of the IPO were used entirely to pay down our 2ndlien credit facility in full and to repay a portion of our 1stlien credit facility.  Proceeds from the option exercise were used for general corporate purposes, including additional pre-payment of the 1stlien credit facility.



Our capitalization prior to the IPO consisted of Series A Preferred Stock, Class B Common Stock and Class A Common Stock.  In connection with the IPO, we effected a corporate reorganization in which, after giving effect to a 3.294 for one reverse Class A Common Stock split, our Class B Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock was converted into Class A Common Stock and our Class A Common Stock was then reclassified as common stock. Following the IPO, we have only one class of common stock outstanding. We refer to these transactions, as the “Corporate Reorganization.” For more information regarding our Corporate Reorganization, see “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Corporate reorganization.”





Our products



We design, engineer and manufacture generators with an output of between 800W and 9mW. In the manufacturing process for our generators, we design, manufacture, source and modifyengines, alternators, transfer switches and other components necessary to production. We classify our products into three classes based on similar range of power output and similar primary customer usage: residential power products; industrial and commercial power products; and other products. The following summary outlines our portfolio of products, including their key attributes and customer applications.



Residential power products



Our automatic residential standby generators range in output from 6kW to 60kW, with manufacturer's suggested retail prices, or MSRPs, from approximately $1,800 to $15,000. They operate on either natural gas or liquid propane and are permanently installed with an automatic transfer switch, which we also manufacture. Our residential standby generators powered by air-cooled engines range in outputs from 6kW to 20kW and are available in steel and aluminum enclosures. Our generators powered by liquid-cooled engines range in outputs from 22kW to 60kW, including the Guardian® Series and the premium Quietsource® Series, with a quiet, low-speed engine and a standard aluminum enclosure.



We provide portable generators fueled by gasoline that range in size from 800W to 17,500W. Following the expiration of a non-compete agreement in 2007, we expanded our portable product offering to introduce portable generators below 12,500W. We currently have four portable product lines: the GP series, targeted at homeowners, ranging from 1,850W to 17,500W; the XG series, targeted at the premium homeowner markets, ranging from 4,000 to 10,000W; the XP series, targeted at the professional contractor market, ranging from 4,000 to 8,000W; and the iX series, targeted at the recreational market, ranging from 800W to 2,000W.



Residential power products comprised 57.9%, 63.0% and 62.9%, respectively, of total net sales in 2008, 2009 and 2010.



Industrial and commercial power products



Our light-commercial standby generators include a full range of affordable generators from 22kW to 150kW and related transfer switches, providing three-phase power that is sufficient for most small and mid-sized businesses including grocery stores, convenience stores, restaurants, gas stations, pharmacies, retail banks and small health care facilities. Our light-commercial generators run on natural gas or liquid propane thereby eliminating the fuel spillages, spoilage, environmental or odor concerns that are common with traditional diesel units.



We manufacture a broad line of standard and configured standby generators and related transfer switches for industrial applications. Our single-engine industrial generators range in output from 10kW to 600kW with our Modular Power System (MPS) technology extending our product range up to 9mW. We offer four fuel options including diesel, natural gas, liquid propane or Bi-Fuel™. Bi-Fuel™ generators operate on a combination of both diesel and natural gas to allow our customers the advantage of multiple fuel sources and extended run times.



Our MPS technology combines the power of several smaller generators to produce the output of a larger generator, providing our customers with redundancy and scalability in a cost-effective manner. For larger industrial applications, our MPS products offer customers an efficient, affordable way to scale their standby power needs. By offering a series of smaller Generac generators integrated with Generac's proprietary PowerManager control system, we provide a lower costalternative to traditional large, single-engine generators. The MPS product line also offers superior functionality due to the redundancy and scalability of the generator systems.



We provide the telecommunications market our full range of generator systems, ranging from 20kW air-cooled generators to 3mW MPS.



Industrial and commercial power products comprised 36.2%, 31.9% and 31.0%, respectively, of total net sales in 2008, 2009 and 2010.





Other power products



Our RV generators range in size from 3.4kW to 8.5kW and are available in gasoline, liquid propane or diesel fuel models. These generators are sold directly to original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, as well as aftermarket dealers. We also sell our proprietary air-cooled engines to third-party equipment OEMs and sell after-market generator service parts to our dealers.



Other power products comprise 5.9%, 5.1% and 6.1%, respectively, of total net sales in 2008, 2009 and 2010.



Distribution channels and customers



We distribute our product through several channels to increase awareness of our product categories and the Generac® brand, and to ensure our products reach a broad customer base. This distribution network includes independent residential and industrial dealers, electrical wholesalers, national accounts, private label arrangements, retailers, catalogs and e-commerce merchants. We believe our distribution network is a competitive advantage that we have strengthened over the last decade by expanding our network from our base of industrial dealers to include other channels of distribution as we have increased our product offerings. Our network is well balanced with no single sales channel providing more than 25% of our sales and no customer providing more than 6% of our sales in 2010.



Our dealer network, which is located principally in the United States and Canada, is the industry's largest network of independent generator contractors.



Our residential dealer network sells, installs and services our residential and light-commercial products to end users. We have developed a number of proprietary dealer management programs to evaluate, manage and incentivize our dealers, which we believe has an important impact on the high level of customer service we provide to end customers. These programs include both technical and sales training, under which we train new and existing dealers about our products, service and installation. We regularly perform market analyses to determine if a given market is either under-served or has poor residential dealer representation. Within these locations, we selectively add distribution or invest resources in existing dealer support and training to improve dealer performance.



Our industrial dealer network provides industrial and commercial end-users with on-going, local and nationwide product support. Our industrial dealers maintain the local relationships with commercial electrical contractors, specifying engineers and national account regional buying offices. Our sales group works in conjunction with our industrial dealers to ensure that national accounts receive engineering support, competitive pricing and nationwide service. We promote our industrial generators through the use of product demonstrations, specifying engineer education events, dealer forums and training. In recent years, we have been particularly focused on expanding our industrial dealer network in Canada and Latin America in order to expand our international sales opportunities.



Our wholesaler network consists of selling branches of both national and local distribution houses for electrical and HVAC products. Our wholesalers distribute our residential and light-commercial generators and are a key introduction to the standby generator category for electrical and HVAC contractors who may not be Generac dealers.



On a selective basis, we have established arrangements with private label partners to provide residential, light-commercial and industrial generators. The partners include leading home equipment, electrical equipment and construction machinery companies, each of which provides access to incremental channels of distribution for our products. We have agreements in place with these partners having terms of between three and four years and further establishing additional terms and conditions of these arrangements.



Our retail distribution network includes thousands of locations and includes regional and national home improvement chains, retailers, clubs, buying groups and farm supply stores. These physical retail locations are supplemented by a number of catalogue and e-commerce retailers. This network primarily sells our residential standby, portable and light-commercial generators. In some cases, we have worked with our retail partners to create installation programs using our residential dealers to support the sale and installation of standby generator products sold at retail. We also use a combination of display units and advertising through our retail accounts to promote awareness for our products.



Additionally, we sell some generators and air-cooled engines directly to OEM manufacturers and after-market dealers for use in the RV and lawn and garden industries.





Manufacturing



Our excellence in manufacturing reflects our philosophy of high standards, continuous improvement and commitment to quality. Our facilities showcase our advanced manufacturing techniques and demonstrate the effectiveness of lean manufacturing.



We continually seek to reduce manufacturing costs while improving product quality. We deliver an affordable product to our customers through our value engineering philosophy, our strategic foreign sourcing, our scale, and adherence to lean manufacturing principles. We believe we have sufficient capacity to achieve our business goals for the near term without the need for significant expansion.



Our product quality is essential to maintaining a leading market position. Incoming shipments from our suppliers are tested to ensure engineering specifications are met. Purchased components are tested for quality at the supplier’s factory and prior to entering production lines and are continuously tested throughout the manufacturing process. Internal product and production audits are performed to ensure a quality product and process. We test finished products under a variety of simulated conditions at each of our manufacturing facilities.



Research and development and intellectual property



Our primary focus on generators drives technological innovation, specialized engineering and manufacturing competencies. Research and development is a core competency and includes a staff of close to 120 engineers working on numerous active projects. Our sponsored research and development expense was $9.9 million, $10.8 million and $14.7 million for the years ended December 2008, 2009 and 2010.Research and development is conducted at each of our manufacturing facilities and additionally at our technical center in Suzhou, China with dedicated teams for each product line. Research and development is focused on developing new technologies and product enhancements as well as maintaining product competitiveness by improving manufacturing costs, safety characteristics, reliability and performance while ensuring compliance with governmental standards. We have had over 30 years of experience using natural gas engines and have developed specific expertise with fuel systems and emissions technology. In the residential market we have developed proprietary engines, cooling packages, controls, fuel systems and emissions systems. We believe that our expertise in engine powered equipment gives us the capability to develop new products that will allow us to diversify our end markets.



We rely on a combination of patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Our commitment to research and development has resulted in a portfolio of approximately 50 U.S. and international patents and patent applications. Our patents expire between January 2017 and September 2027 and protect certain features and technologies we have developed for use in our products including fuel systems, air flow, electronics and controls, noise reduction and air-cooled engines. U.S. trademark registrations generally have a perpetual duration if they are properly maintained and renewed. New U.S. patents that are issued generally have a life of 20 years from the date the patent application is initially filed. We believe the existence of these patents and trademarks, along with our ongoing processes to register additional patents and trademarks, protect our intellectual property rights and enhance our competitive position. We also use proprietary manufacturing processes that require customized equipment.



Suppliers of raw materials



Our primary raw material inputs are steel, copper and aluminum, all of which are purchased from third parties and, in many cases, as part of machined or manufactured components. We have developed an extensive network of reliable, low-cost suppliers in the United States and abroad. We continuously evaluate the cost structure of our products and source components accordingly based on this evaluation. In 2010, we sourced more than half of our components from outside the United States.



Competition



The market for onsite standby generators is competitive. We face competition from a variety of large diversified industrial companies as well as smaller generator manufacturers abroad. However, most of the traditional participants in the standby generator market compete on a more specialized basis, focused on specific applications within their larger diversified product mix. We are the only significant market participant focused predominantly on standby and portable generators with broad capabilities across the residential, industrial and light-commercial generator markets. We believe that our engineering capabilities and core focus on generators provide us with manufacturing flexibility and enable us to maintain a first-mover advantage over our competition for product innovation.





Our competitors include Briggs & Stratton, Caterpillar, Cummins, Honda, Kohler, MTU (Katolight division), and Techtronics International (TTI). In the market for standby industrial and commercial generators, our primary competitors are Caterpillar, Cummins, Kohler and MTU, most of which focus on the market for diesel generators as they are also diesel engine manufacturers. In the market for residential standby generators, our primary competitors include Briggs & Stratton, Cummins (Onan division) and Kohler, which also have broad operations in other manufacturing businesses. In the portable generator market, our primary competitors include Briggs & Stratton, Honda and Techtronics International (TTI), along with a number of smaller domestic and foreign competitors.



There are a number of other standby generator manufacturers located outside North America, but most supply their products mainly to their respective regional markets. In a continuously evolving sector, we believe our size and broad capabilities make us well positioned to remain competitive.



We compete primarily on the basis of brand reputation, quality, reliability, pricing, innovative features, breadth of product and product availability.



Employees



As of December 31, 2010, we had 1,444 employees (1,282 full time and 162 part-time and temporary employees). Of those, 818 employees were directly involved in manufacturing at our manufacturing facilities.



We have had an “open shop” bargaining agreement for the past 45 years. Our current agreement is with the Communication Workers of America, Local 5503. The current agreement, which expires October 14, 2011, covers our Waukesha and Eagle facilities. Currently, less than 2% of our workforce is a member of a labor union. Our facility in Whitewater, Wisconsin is not unionized.
