BUSINESS STRATEGIES



The following is a discussion of the Company’s business strategies in regards to real estate investment and management.



Business Strategies



Research Driven Approach to Investments–The Company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge. The Company continually assesses markets where the Company operates, as well as markets where the Company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating the following:



•Focus on markets in major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million;

•Constraints on new supply driven by: (i) low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built; (ii) political growth barriers, such as protected land, urban growth boundaries, and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes; and (iii) natural limitations to development, such as mountains or waterways;

•Rental demand is enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of for-sale housing; and

•Housing demand that is based on job growth, proximity to jobs, high median incomes and the quality of life including related commuting factors.



Recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic, and local market research, and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly. The Company seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to









have declining economic conditions. Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields.



Property Operations– The Company manages its communities by focusing on activities that may generate above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and long-term asset appreciation.  The Company intends to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below:



•Property Management–Oversee delivery of and quality of the housing provided to our residents and manage the properties financial performance.

•Capital Preservation –Asset Management is responsible for the planning, budgeting and completion of major capital improvement projects at the Company’s communities.

•Business Planning and Control –Comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with significant investment decisions. These plans include benchmarks for future financial performance, based on collaborative discussions between on-site managers and senior management.

•Development and Redevelopment –The Company focuses on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply constrained markets, and redeveloping its existing communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of the Company’s communities.

Dispositions of Real Estate



As part of its strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets, the Company continually evaluates all the communities and sells those which no longer meet its strategic criteria. The Company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higher-return communities or other real estate investments, or repay debts. The Company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on its future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect its ongoing operations. Generally, the Company seeks to have any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions offset by the positive impact of its acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities.



In January 2016, the Company sold its former headquarters office building, located in Palo Alto, CA, for gross proceeds of $18.0 million, resulting in total gains of $9.6 million.



During2016, the Company sold three apartment communities, Harvest Park, Tuscana, and Candlewood North, for a total of  $80.8 million, resulting in total gains of $14.0 million, net of $4.4 million deferred tax gain on sale of real estate.



During 2016, the Company sold two joint venture apartment communities, The Heights and Canyon Creek, for total proceeds of $147.3 million. The Company's share of the gain on the sales was $13.0 million.



In November 2016, the Company contributed four apartment communities, Bridgeport, The Carlyle, Hillsborough Park, and Meadowood to a new entity, BEX II, then a wholly-owned subsidiary of EPLP and in December 2016 sold a 49.9%









membership interest in BEX II for a total of $153.2 million, resulting in total gains of $126.6 million. Subsequent to this sale, the Company accounts for BEX II under the equity method.



Development Pipeline



The Company defines development projects as new communities that are being constructed or are newly constructed and are in a phase of lease-up and have not yet reached stabilized operations. As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company had two consolidated development projects and four joint venture development projects comprised of2,223apartment homes for an estimated cost of$1.3 billion, of which$0.7 billionremains to be expended, and$0.5 billionis the Company's share.



The Company defines predevelopment projects as proposed communities in negotiation or in the entitlement process with an expected high likelihood of becoming entitled development projects. As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company had various consolidated predevelopment projects. The Company may also acquire land for future development purposes or sale.

Redevelopment Pipeline



The Company defines the redevelopment pipeline as existing properties owned or recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment by the Company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement.  During redevelopment, apartment homes may not be available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company had ownership interests in six major redevelopment communities aggregating1,869apartment homes with estimated redevelopment costs of$170.2 million, of which approximately$65.5 millionremains to be expended.











Long Term Debt



During2016, the Company made regularly scheduled principal payments and loan payoffs of$177.0 millionof its secured mortgage notes payable at an average interest rate of5.0%.



In April 2016, the Company issued $450 million of 3.375% senior unsecured notes that mature in April 2026. The interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15thand October 15thof each year, commencing October 15, 2016, until the maturity date in April 2026. The Company used the net proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness under its unecured lines of credit and for other general corporate purposes.



Bank Debt



As ofDecember 31, 2016, Fitch Ratings ("Fitch"), Moody’s Investor Service, and Standard and Poor's (“S&P”) credit agencies rated Essex Property Trust, Inc. and Essex Portfolio, L.P. BBB+/Stable, Baa1/Stable, and BBB+/Stable, respectively.



At December 31, 2016, the Company had two lines of unsecured credit aggregating $1.03 billion. The Company's $1.0 billion credit facility had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.90%, which is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's credit ratings. In January 2017, the Company's $1.0 billion credit facility's maturity date was extended to December 2020 with one 18-month extension, exercisable at the Company's option. The Company's $25.0 million working capital unsecured line of credit had an interest rate of LIBOR plus 0.90%, which is based on a tiered rate structure tied to the Company's credit ratings. The $25.0 million credit facility matures in January 2018.



Equity Transactions



During2016, ESS did not issue any shares of common stock under its equity distribution program. Furthermore, during the first quarter of2017throughFebruary 21, 2017, ESS has not issued any shares under its equity distribution program.



Co-investments



The Company has entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures or partnerships (including limited liability companies) through which we own an indirect economic interest in less than 100% of the community or land owned directly by the joint venture or partnership. For each joint venture the Company holds a 50% to 55% non-controlling interest in the venture and will earn customary management fees and may earn development, asset property management fees and may also earn a promote interest.



The Company has also made, and may continue in the future to make, preferred equity investments in various multi-family development projects. The Company earns a preferred rate of return on these investments.



OFFICES AND EMPLOYEES



The Company is headquartered in San Mateo, California, and has regional offices in Woodland Hills, California; San Jose, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California and Bellevue, Washington. As ofDecember 31, 2016, the Company had1,799employees.



INSURANCE



The Company purchases general liability and property insurance coverage, including loss of rent, for each of its communities. The Company also purchases limited earthquake, terrorism, environmental and flood insurance. There are certain types of losses which may not be covered or could exceed coverage limits. The insurance programs are subject to deductibles and self-insured retentions in varying amounts. The Company utilizes a wholly owned insurance subsidiary, Pacific Western Insurance LLC ("PWI") to self-insure certain earthquake and property losses. As ofDecember 31, 2016, PWI has cash and marketable securities of approximately$69.9 million, and is consolidated in the Company's financial statements.



All of the Company's communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity. The Company evaluates its financial loss exposure to seismic events by using actuarial loss models developed by the insurance industry and property vulnerability based on structural evaluations of seismic consultants. The Company manages this exposure, where considered appropriate, desirable, and cost-effective, by upgrading properties to increase their resistance to forces caused by seismic events, by considering available funds and coverages provided by PWI and/or by purchasing seismic insurance. The Company also purchases limited earthquake insurance for certain properties owned by the Company's co-investments.









In addition, the Company carries other types of insurance coverage related to a variety of risks and exposures.

Based on market conditions, the Company may change or potentially eliminate insurance coverages, or increase levels of self-insurance. Further, the Company may incur losses, which could be material, due to uninsured risks, deductibles and self-insured retentions, and/or losses in excess of coverage limits.

COMPETITION



There are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the Company’s communities in attracting residents. These include other apartment communities, condominiums and single-family homes. If the demand for the Company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing housing, rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.



The Company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities. Some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company. This competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the Company acquires and or develops.



WORKING CAPITAL



The Company believes that cash flows generated by its operations, existing cash and marketable securities balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during2017.



The timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates, stock price, and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect the Company’s plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities.



ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS



See the discussion under the caption, “Risks Related to Real Estate Investments and Our Operations -The Company’s Portfolio may have environmental liabilities” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on its operations, which discussion under the caption “The Company’s Portfolio may have environmental liabilities” is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.



OTHER MATTERS



Certain Policies of the Company



The Company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its common stock, (ii) fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and (iii) offer shares of common stock and/or units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate.



The Company invests primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the Seattle metropolitan area. The Company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions.  However, these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management.
