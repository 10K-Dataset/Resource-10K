BUSINESS STRATEGIES



The following is a discussion of the Company’s business strategies in regards to real estate investment and management.



Business Strategies



Research Driven Approach to Investments–The Company believes that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge.  The Company continually assesses markets where the Company operates, as well as markets where the Company considers future investment opportunities by evaluating the following:



·Focus on markets in major metropolitan areas that have regional population in excess of one million;

·Constraints on new supply driven by: (i) low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be economically built; (ii) political growth barriers, such as protected land, urban growth boundaries, and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes; and (iii) natural limitations to development, such as mountains or waterways;

·Rental demand is enhanced by affordability of rents relative to costs of for-sale housing; and

·Housing demand that is based on proximity to jobs, high median incomes, the quality of life and related commuting factors, as well as potential job growth.





Recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical, the Company regularly evaluates the results of its regional economic, and its local market research, and adjusts the geographic focus of its portfolio accordingly.  The Company seeks to increase its Portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions.  Likewise, the Company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields.



Property Operations– The Company manages its communities by focusing on activities that generate above-average rental growth, tenant retention/satisfaction and long-term asset appreciation.  The Company intends to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below:



·Property Management–Oversee delivery of and quality of the housing provided to our residents and are responsible for the properties financial performance.

·Capital Preservation –Asset Management is responsible for the planning, budgeting and completion of major capital improvement projects at the Company’s communities.

·Business Planning and Control –Comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with every investment decision.  These plans include benchmarks for future financial performance, based on collaborative discussions between on-site managers and senior management.

·Development and Redevelopment –The Company focuses on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply constrained markets, and redeveloping its existing communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of the Company’s communities.

Dispositions of Real Estate



As part of its strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply-constrained markets, the Company continually evaluates all the communities and sells those which no longer meet its strategic criteria.  The Company may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higher-return communities or other real estate investments, or repay debts.  The Company believes that the sale of these communities will not have a material impact on its future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect its ongoing operations.  Generally, the Company seeks to have any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions offset by the positive impact of its acquisitions, development and redevelopment activities.



During 2012, the Company sold two apartment communities, for a total of $28.3 million resulting in a gain of $10.9 million.  Also, Essex Apartment Value Fund II sold seven communities for a total of $413.0 million.  The total gain on the transaction was $106 million, of which the Company’s pro-rata share was $29.1 million.



Development Pipeline



The Company defines development projects as new communities that are in various stages of active development, or the community is in lease-up and phases of the project are not completed.  As of December 31, 2012, the Company had two consolidated development projects and seven joint venture development projects comprised of 2,495 units for an estimated cost of $928.4 million, of which $463.9 million remains to be expended.



The Company defines the predevelopment projects as proposed communities in negotiation or in the entitlement process with a high likelihood of becoming entitled development projects.  As of December 31, 2012, the Company had two consolidated predevelopment projects and one unconsolidated joint venture predevelopment project aggregating 449 units.  The Company may also acquire land for future development purposes or sale.

Redevelopment Pipeline



The Company defines redevelopment pipeline as existing properties owned or recently acquired, which have been targeted for additional investment by the Company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement.  During redevelopment, apartment units may not be available for rent and, as a result, may have less than stabilized operations.

Long Term Debt



During 2012, the Company paid off $237.7 million in secured debt including secured mortgage debt totaling $202.6 million at an average interest rate of 5.5% and $35.1 million of tax-exempt bonds.  Also, the Essex Skyline secured loan was repaid for $80.0 million.

This facility matures in December 2015 with two one-year extension options.  In November, Fitch Ratings upgraded the Company’s credit rating to BBB+ with a stable outlook from BBB with a positive outlook.  As a result, the pricing on the Company’s unsecured credit facility was reduced from LIBOR + 120 basis points to LIBOR + 107.5 basis points, and the pricing for the Company’s $350.0 term loan was reduced from LIBOR + 130 basis points to LIBOR + 120 basis points.



During 2012, the Company increased the size of the unsecured term loan from $200 million to $350 million.  The Company entered into interest rate swap contracts for a term of five years with a notional amount totaling $300 million, which effectively converted the interest rate on $300 million of the term loan to a fixed rate.

OFFICES AND EMPLOYEES



The Company is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, and has regional offices in Woodland Hills, California; Irvine, California; San Diego, California and Bellevue, Washington.  As of December 31, 2012, the Company had 1,144 employees.



INSURANCE



The Company carries comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the communities.  Under comprehensive liability claims, the Company has insurance to cover claims in excess of $100,000 per incident.  Under property casualty claims, the Company reinsures the primary carrier for losses up to $5.0 million deductible per incident. There are, however, certain types of extraordinary losses, such as, losses from terrorism and earthquakes, for which the Company does not have insurance.  Substantially all of the communities are located in areas that are subject to earthquakes.



The Company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses.  The Company utilizes third-party seismic consultants for its acquisitions and may perform seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake.  The Company utilizes third-party loss models to help to determine its exposure.  The majority of the communities are lower density garden-style apartments which may be less susceptible to material earthquake damage.  The Company will continue to monitor third-party earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining third-party coverage if it deems it cost effective.



Although the Company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its communities, employees, residents, and compliance with applicable laws, it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks, deductibles, co-payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material.



COMPETITION



There are numerous housing alternatives that compete with the Company’s communities in attracting residents.  These include other apartment communities, and single-family homes.  The communities also compete for residents with new and existing condominiums.  If the demand for the Company’s communities is reduced or if competitors develop and/or acquire competing housing, rental rates and occupancy may drop which may have a material adverse affect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.



The Company faces competition from other real estate investment trusts, businesses and other entities in the acquisition, development and operation of apartment communities.  Some competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than the Company.  This competition may result in increased costs of apartment communities the Company acquires and or develops.





WORKING CAPITAL



The Company believes that cash flows generated by its operations, existing cash and marketable securities balances, availability under existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of its reasonably anticipated cash needs during 2013.  The timing, source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment, which can affect its plans for acquisitions, dispositions, development and redevelopment activities.



ENVIRONMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS



See the discussion under the caption, “The Company’s Portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities” in Item 1A, Risk Factors, for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on its operations, which discussion under the caption “The Company’s Portfolio may have unknown environmental liabilities” is incorporated by reference into this Item 1.



OTHER MATTERS



Certain Policies of the Company



The Company intends to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject it to regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Company has in the past five years and may in the future (i) issue securities senior to its common stock, (ii) fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and (iii) offer shares of common stock and/or units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions. The Company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the Company, when such entities’ underlying assets are real estate.

The Company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions.  However, these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management.
