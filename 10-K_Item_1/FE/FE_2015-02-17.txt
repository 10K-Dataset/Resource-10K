Utility Regulation



State Regulation



Each of the Utilities' retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and other matters are subject to regulation in the states in which it operates - in Maryland by the MDPSC, in Ohio by the PUCO, in New Jersey by the NJBPU, in Pennsylvania by the PPUC, in West Virginia by the WVPSC and in New York by the NYPSC.The transmission operations of PE in Virginia are subject to certain regulations of the VSCC. In addition, under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate rates of a public utility, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the utility.



As competitive retail electric suppliers serving retail customers primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Maryland, FES and AE Supply are subject to state laws applicable to competitive electric suppliers in those states, including affiliate codes of conduct that apply to FES, AE Supply and their public utility affiliates.In addition, if any of the FirstEnergy affiliates were to engage in the construction of significant new transmission or generation facilities, depending on the state, they may be required to obtain state regulatory authorization to site, construct and operate the new transmission or generation facility.



Federal Regulation



With respect to their wholesale services and rates, the Utilities, AE Supply, ATSI, AGC, FES, FG, NG, PATH and TrAIL are subject to regulation by FERC. Under the FPA, FERC regulates rates for interstate wholesale sales, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. FERC regulations require ATSI, JCP&L, ME, MP, PE, PN, WP and TrAIL to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, terms and conditions. Transmission facilities of ATSI, JCP&L, ME, MP, PE, PN, WP and TrAIL are subject to functional control by PJM and transmission service using their transmission facilities is provided by PJM under the PJM Tariff. See FERC Matters below.



FERC regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce in part by granting authority to public utilities to sell wholesale power at market-based rates upon showing that the seller cannot exert market power in generation or transmission or erect barriers to entry into markets. The Utilities, AE Supply, FES, FG, NG, FirstEnergy Generation Mansfield Unit 1 Corp., Buchanan Generation, LLC, and Green Valley Hydro, LLC each have been authorized by FERC to sell wholesale power in interstate commerce and have a market-based rate tariff on file with FERC; although major wholesale purchases remain subject to regulation by the relevant state commissions. As a condition to selling electricity on a wholesale basis at market-based rates, the Utilities, AE Supply, FES, FG, NG, FirstEnergy Generation Mansfield Unit 1 Corp., Buchanan Generation, LLC, and Green Valley Hydro, LLC, like other entities granted market-based rate authority, must file electronic quarterly reports with FERC listing their sales transactions for the prior










quarter. However, consistent with its historical practice, FERC has granted AE Supply, FES, FG, NG, FirstEnergy Generation Mansfield Unit 1 Corp., Buchanan Generation, LLC, and Green Valley Hydro, LLC a waiver from certain reporting, record-keeping and accounting requirements that typically apply to traditional public utilities. Along with market-based rate authority, FERC also granted AE Supply, FES, FG, NG, FirstEnergy Generation Mansfield Unit 1 Corp., Buchanan Generation, LLC, and Green Valley Hydro, LLC blanket authority to issue securities and assume liabilities under Section 204 of the FPA.



The nuclear generating facilities owned and leased by NG, OE and TE, and operated by FENOC, are subject to extensive regulation by the NRC. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the licenses. FENOC is the licensee for the operating nuclear plants and has direct compliance responsibility for NRC matters. FES controls the economic dispatch of NG’s plants. See Nuclear Regulation below.



Federally-enforceable mandatory reliability standards apply to the bulk electric system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting requirements on the Utilities, FES, AE Supply, FG, FENOC, NG, ATSI and TrAIL.NERC is the ERO designated by FERC to establish and enforce these reliability standards, although NERC has delegated day-to-day implementation and enforcement of these reliability standards toeightregional entities, including RFC.All of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within the RFC region.FirstEnergy actively participates in the NERC and RFC stakeholder processes, and otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability standards implemented and enforced by RFC.



FirstEnergy believes that it is in compliance with all currently-effective and enforceable reliability standards.Nevertheless, in the course of operating its extensive electric utility systems and facilities, FirstEnergy occasionally learns of isolated facts or circumstances that could be interpreted as excursions from the reliability standards.If and when such occurrences are found, FirstEnergy develops information about the occurrence and develops a remedial response to the specific circumstances, including in appropriate cases “self-reporting” an occurrence to RFC.Moreover, it is clear that NERC, RFC and FERC will continue to refine existing reliability standards as well as to develop and adopt new reliability standards.Any inability on FirstEnergy's part to comply with the reliability standards for its bulk electric system could result in the imposition of financial penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Regulatory Accounting



The Utilities, AGC, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL recognize, as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, costs which FERC and the various state utility commissions, as applicable, have authorized for recovery/return from/to customers in future periods or for which authorization is probable. Without the probability of such authorization, costs currently recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would have been charged to income as incurred. All regulatory assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered/returned from/to customers. Based on current ratemaking procedures, the Utilities, AGC, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL continue to collect cost-based rates for their transmission and distribution services and, in the case of PATH, for its abandoned plant, which remains regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Utilities, AGC, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL continue the application of regulatory accounting to those operations.



FirstEnergy accounts for the effects of regulation through the application of regulatory accounting to the Utilities, AGC, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL since their rates are established by a third-party regulator with the authority to set rates that bind customers, are cost-based and can be charged to and collected from customers.



An enterprise meeting all of these criteria capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged to expense (regulatory assets) if the rate actions of its regulator make it probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue. Regulatory accounting is applied only to the parts of the business that meet the above criteria. If a portion of the business applying regulatory accounting no longer meets those requirements, previously recorded net regulatory assets or liabilities are removed from the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP.



Maryland Regulatory Matters



PE provides SOS pursuant to a combination of settlement agreements, MDPSC orders and regulations, and statutory provisions.SOS supply is competitively procured in the form of rolling contracts of varying lengths through periodic auctions that are overseen by the MDPSC and a third party monitor.Although settlements with respect to residential SOS for PE customers expired on December 31, 2012, by statute, service continues in the same manner unless changed by order of the MDPSC.The settlement provisions relating to non-residential SOS have also expired; however, by MDPSC order, the terms of service remain in place unless PE requests or the MDPSC orders a change.PE recovers its costs plus a return for providing SOS.



The Maryland legislature adopted a statute in 2008 codifying the EmPOWER Maryland goals to reduce electric consumption by10%and reduce electricity demand by15%, in each case by 2015.PE's initial plan submitted in compliance with the statute was approved in 2009, at which time expenditures were estimated to be approximately$101 millionfor the PE programs for the entire period of 2009-2015.PE's third plan, covering the three-year period 2015-2017, was approved by the MDPSC on December 23, 2014.The projected costs of the 2015-2017 plan are approximately$64 millionfor that three year period.PE continues to recover










program costs subject to afive-year amortization.Maryland law only allows for the utility to recover lost distribution revenue attributable to energy efficiency or demand reduction programs through a base rate case proceeding, and to date such recovery has not been sought or obtained by PE.



The MDPSC adopted rules, effective May 28, 2012, that set utility-specific SAIDI and SAIFI targets for 2012-2015; prescribed detailed tree-trimming requirements, outage restoration and downed wire response deadlines; imposed other reliability and customer satisfaction requirements; and established annual reporting requirements.The MDPSC is required to assess each utility's compliance with the new rules, and may assess penalties of up to$25,000per day, per violation.The MDPSC issued orders accepting PE's reports on compliance under the new rules on September 3, 2013 and August 27, 2014.



On February 27, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order (the February 27 Order) requiring the Maryland electric utilities to submit analyses, relating to the costs and benefits of making further system and staffing enhancements in order to attempt to reduce storm outage durations.



The order further required the Staff of the MDPSC to report on possible performance-based rate structures and to propose additional rules relating to feeder performance standards, outage communication and reporting, and sharing of special needs customer information.



PE's final filing on September 3, 2013, discussed the steps needed to harden the utility's system in order to attempt to achieve various levels of storm response speed described in the February 27 Order, and projected that it would require approximately



$2.7 billion



in infrastructure investments over






years to attempt to achieve the quickest level of response for the largest storm projected in the February 27 Order.



On July 1, 2014, the Staff of the MDPSC issued a set of reports that recommended the imposition of extensive additional requirements in the areas of storm response, feeder performance, estimates of restoration times, and regulatory reporting.



The Staff also recommended the imposition of penalties, including customer rebates, for a utility's failure or inability to comply with the escalating standards of storm restoration speed proposed by the Staff.

I

n addition, the Staff proposed that the utilities be required to develop and implement system hardening plans, up to a rate impact cap on cost. The MDPSC conducted a hearing September 15-18, 2014, to consider certain of these matters, and has not yet scheduled further proceedings on any of the matters.



New Jersey Regulatory Matters



JCP&L currently provides BGS for retail customers who do not choose a third party EGS and for customers of third party EGSs that fail to provide the contracted service.The supply for BGS, which is comprised oftwocomponents, is provided through contracts procured through separate, annually held descending clock auctions, the results of which are approved by the NJBPU.OneBGS component and auction, reflecting hourly real time energy prices, is available for larger commercial and industrial customers.The other BGS component and auction, providing a fixed price service, is intended for smaller commercial and residential customers.All New Jersey EDCs participate in this competitive BGS procurement process and recover BGS costs directly from customers as a charge separate from base rates.



In an order issued July 31, 2012, the NJBPU ordered JCP&L to file a base rate case using a historical 2011 test year.The rate case petition was filed on November 30, 2012 by JCP&L requesting approval to increase revenues by approximately$31 million, which included the recovery of 2011 storm restoration costs but excluded approximately$603 millionof costs incurred in 2012 associated with the impact of Hurricane Sandy.In the initial briefs of the parties, the Division of Rate Counsel recommended that base rate revenues be reduced by $214.9 million while the NJBPU Staff recommended a $207.4 million reduction (such amounts do not address the revenue requirements associated with the major storm events of 2011 and 2012).On May 5, 2014, JCP&L submitted updated schedules to reflect the result of the generic storm cost proceeding, discussed below, to revise the debt rate to5.93%, and to request that base rate revenues be increased by$9.1 million, including the recovery of 2011 storm costs.The record in the case was closed as of June 30, 2014.The ALJ provided his initial Decision on January 8, 2015, which recommended an annual revenue reduction of $107.5 million and did not include the recovery of 2012 storm costs or any CTA.On February 11, 2015, the NJBPU approved a 45-day extension to render a final decision.



On January 23, 2013, the NJBPU opened a generic proceeding to review its policies with respect to the use of a CTA in base rate cases.



The NJBPU and its Staff solicited, and were provided, input from interested stakeholders, including utilities and the Division of Rate Counsel.



On June 18, 2014, the NJBPU Staff proposed to amend current CTA policy by:



1) calculating savings using a 5 year look back from the beginning of the test year;



2) allocating savings with 75% retained by the company and 25% allocated to rate payers;



and 3) excluding transmission assets of electric distribution companies in the savings calculation.



JCP&L and other stakeholders filed written comments on the Staff proposal.



In its Order issued October 22, 2014, the NJBPU stated it would continue to apply its current CTA policy in base rate cases, subject to incorporating the staff proposed modifications (as discussed above).



For pending base rate cases in which the record had closed, such as JCP&L’s, the NJBPU would, following an initial decision of the ALJ, reopen the record for the limited purpose of adding a CTA calculation reflecting the modified policy and allow parties the opportunity to comment.



FirstEnergy expects the application of the modified policy in the pending JCP&L base rate case to reduce annual revenues by approximately $5 million.



On November 5, 2014, the Division of Rate Counsel appealed the NJBPU Order to the New Jersey Superior Court.



JCP&L has filed to participate as a respondent in that proceeding.



On March 20, 2013, the NJBPU ordered that a generic proceeding be established to investigate the prudence of costs incurred by all New Jersey utilities for service restoration efforts associated with the major storm events of 2011 and 2012.The Order provided that if any utility had already filed a proceeding for recovery of such storm costs, to the extent the amount of approved recovery had not yet been determined, the prudence of such costs would be reviewed in the generic proceeding.On May 31, 2013, the NJBPU clarified its earlier order to indicate that the 2011 major storm costs would be reviewed expeditiously in the generic proceeding,










with the goal of maintaining the base rate case schedule established by the ALJ where recovery of such costs would be addressed.The NJBPU further indicated that it would review the 2012 major storm costs in the generic proceeding and the recovery of such costs would be considered through a Phase II in the existing base rate case or through another appropriate method to be determined at the conclusion of the generic proceeding.On June 21, 2013, JCP&L filed a detailed report in support of recovery of major storm costs with the NJBPU.On February 24, 2014, a Stipulation was filed with the NJBPU by JCP&L, the Division of Rate Counsel and NJBPU Staff which will allow recovery of $736 million of JCP&L’s $744 million of costs related to the significant weather events of 2011 and 2012. As a result, FirstEnergy recorded a regulatory asset impairment charge of approximately $8 million (pre-tax) as of December 31, 2013.By its Order of March 19, 2014, the NJBPU approved the Stipulation of Settlement. Although the settlement permits recovery of 2011 and 2012 storm costs, the recovery of the 2011 costs will be addressed in the pending base rate case; whereas the manner and timing of recovery of the 2012 storm costs totaling $580 million will be determined by the NJBPU.



Ohio Regulatory Matters



The Ohio Companies primarily operate under their ESP 3 plan which expires on May 31, 2016. The material terms of ESP 3 include:

•Continuing the current base distribution rate freeze through May 31, 2016;

•Continues collection of lost distribution revenues associated with energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs;

•Continuing to provide economic development and assistance to low-income customers for thetwo-year plan period at levels established in the prior ESP;

•A6%generation rate discount to certain low income customers provided by the Ohio Companies through a bilateral wholesale contract with FES (FES is one of the wholesale suppliers to the Ohio Companies);

•Continuing to provide power to non-shopping customers at a market-based price set through an auction process;

•Continuing Rider DCR that allows continued investment in the distribution system for the benefit of customers;

•Continuing commitment not to recover from retail customers certain costs related to transmission cost allocations for the longer of the five-year period from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2016 or when the amount of costs avoided by customers for certain types of products totals $360 million, subject to the outcome of certain FERC proceedings;

•Securing generation supply for a longer period of time by conducting an auction for athree-year period rather than aone-year period, in each of October 2012 and January 2013, to mitigate any potential price spikes for the Ohio Companies' utility customers who do not switch to a competitive generation supplier; and

•Extending the recovery period for costs associated with purchasing RECs mandated by SB221, Ohio's renewable energy and energy efficiency standard, through the end of the new ESP 3 period. This is expected to initially reduce the monthly renewable energy charge for all non-shopping utility customers of the Ohio Companies by spreading out the costs over the entire ESP period.



Notices of appeal of the Ohio Companies' ESP 3 plan to the Supreme Court of Ohio were filed by the Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council and the ELPC. The matter has not yet been scheduled for oral argument.



The Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO on August 4, 2014 seeking approval of their ESP IV entitledPowering Ohio's Progress.The Ohio Companies have requested a decision by the PUCO by April 8, 2015.The Ohio Companies filed a partial Stipulation and Recommendation on December 22, 2014. The evidentiary hearing on the ESP IV is scheduled to commence on April 13, 2015.The material terms of the proposed plan include:

•Continuing a base distribution rate freeze through May 31, 2019;

•Continuing collection of lost distribution revenues associated with energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs;

•Providing economic development and assistance to low-income customers for the three-year plan period;

•An Economic Stability Program providing for a retail rate stability rider to flow through charges or credits representing the net result of the costs paid to FES through a proposed 15-year purchase power agreement for the output of Sammis, Davis-Besse and FES’ share of OVEC against the revenues received from selling the output into the PJM markets over the same period;

•Continuing to provide power to non-shopping customers at a market-based price set through an auction process;

•Continuing Rider DCR with increased revenue caps of approximately $30 million per year that allows continued investment supporting the distribution system for the benefit of customers;

•A commitment not to recover from retail customers certain costs related to transmission cost allocations for the longer of the five-year period from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2016 or when the amount of such costs avoided by customers for certain types of products totals $360 million, including appropriately such costs from MISO along with such costs from PJM, subject to the outcome of certain FERC proceedings; and

•General updates to electric service regulations and tariffs to reflect regulatory orders, administrative rule changes, and current practices.



Under Ohio's energy efficiency standards (SB221 and SB310), and the Ohio Companies' filing of amended energy efficiency plans, the Ohio Companies are required to implement energy efficiency programs that achieve a total annual energy savings equivalent of approximately2,237GWHs in 2014, 2015 and 2016.The Ohio Companies are also required to reduce peak demand in 2009 by1%, with an additional0.75%reduction each year thereafter through 2014, and retain the 2014 level for 2015 and 2016, and then increase the benchmark by an additional 0.75% thereafter through 2020.



On March 20, 2013, the PUCO approved the three-year energy efficiency portfolio plans for 2013-2015, estimated to cost the Ohio Companies approximately$250 millionover the three-year period, which is expected to be recovered in rates.Applications for










rehearing were filed by the Ohio Companies and several other parties.On July 17, 2013, the PUCO denied the Ohio Companies' application for rehearing, in part, but authorized the Ohio Companies to receive20%of any revenues obtained from offering energy efficiency and DR reserves into the PJM auction.The PUCO also confirmed that the Ohio Companies can recover PJM costs and applicable penalties associated with PJM auctions, including the costs of purchasing replacement capacity from PJM incremental auctions, to the extent that such costs or penalties are prudently incurred.On August 16, 2013, ELPC and OCC filed applications for rehearing, which were granted for the sole purpose of further consideration of the issue.On September 24, 2014, the Ohio Companies filed an amendment to their portfolio plan as contemplated by SB310, seeking to suspend certain programs for the 2015-2016 period in order to better align the plan with the new benchmarks under SB310.On November 20, 2014, the PUCO approved the Ohio Companies' amended portfolio plan.Several applications for rehearing were filed, and the PUCO granted those applications for further consideration of the matters specified in those applications.



On September 16, 2013, the Ohio Companies filed with the Supreme Court of Ohio a notice of appeal of the PUCO's July 17, 2013 Entry on Rehearing related to energy efficiency, alternative energy, and long-term forecast rules stating that the rules issued by the PUCO are inconsistent with, and are not supported by, statutory authority.On October 23, 2013, the PUCO filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, which is still pending.The matter has not been scheduled for oral argument.



Ohio law requires electric utilities and electric service companies in Ohio to serve part of their load from renewable energy resources measured by an annually increasing percentage amount through 2024, except 2015 and 2016 that remain at the 2014 level.



The Ohio Companies conducted RFPs in 2009, 2010 and 2011 to secure RECs to help meet these renewable energy requirements.



In September 2011, the PUCO opened a docket to review the Ohio Companies' alternative energy recovery rider through which the Ohio Companies recover the costs of acquiring these RECs.



The PUCO issued an Opinion and Order on August 7, 2013 approving the Ohio Companies' acquisition process and their purchases of RECs to meet statutory mandates in all instances except for part of the purchases arising from one auction and directing the Ohio Companies to credit non-shopping customers in the amount of



$43.4 million

, plus interest,



on the basis that the Ohio Companies did not prove such purchases were prudent.



Based on the PUCO ruling, a regulatory charge of approximately $51 million, including interest, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013.



On December 24, 2013, following the denial of their application for rehearing, the Ohio Companies filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of the PUCO's order with the Supreme Court of Ohio, which was granted.



On February 18, 2014, the OCC and the ELPC also filed appeals of the PUCO's order.



The Ohio Companies filed their merit brief with the Supreme Court of Ohio on March 6, 2014 and the briefing process concluded on December 24, 2014.



The matter is not yet scheduled for oral argument.



On April 9, 2014, the PUCO initiated a generic investigation of marketing practices in the competitive retail electric service market, with a focus on the marketing of fixed-price or guaranteed percent-off SSO rate contracts where there is a provision that permits the pass-through of new or additional charges.



Pennsylvania Regulatory Matters



The Pennsylvania Companies currently operate under DSPs that expire on May 31, 2015, and provide for the competitive procurement of generation supply for customers that do not choose an alternative EGS or for customers of alternative EGSs that fail to provide the contracted service.The default service supply is currently provided by wholesale suppliers through a mix of long-term and short-term contracts procured through descending clock auctions, competitive requests for proposals and spot market purchases.On July 24, 2014, the PPUC unanimously approved a settlement of the Pennsylvania Companies' DSPs for the period of June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2017, that provides for quarterly descending clock auctions to procure 3, 12 and 24-month energy contracts, as well as one RFP seeking 2-year contracts to secure SRECs for ME, PN and Penn.



The PPUC entered an Order on March 3, 2010 that denied the recovery of marginal transmission losses through the TSC rider for the period of June 1, 2007 through March 31, 2008, and directed ME and PN to submit a new tariff or tariff supplement reflecting the removal of marginal transmission losses from the TSC.



Pursuant to a plan approved by the PPUC, ME and PN refunded those amounts to customers over




-months concluding in the second quarter of 2013.



On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the PPUC's Order to the extent that it holds that line loss costs are not transmission costs and, therefore, the approximately



$254 million



in marginal transmission losses and associated carrying charges for the period prior to January 1, 2011, are not recoverable under ME's and PN's TSC riders.



The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied ME's and PN's Petition for Allowance of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the United States denied ME's and PN's Petition for Writ of Certiorari.



The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania granted the PPUC's motion to dismiss the complaint filed by ME and PN to obtain an order that would enjoin enforcement of the PPUC and Pennsylvania court orders under a theory of federal preemption on the question of retail rate recovery of the marginal transmission loss charges.



As a result of the U.S. District Court's decision, FirstEnergy recorded a regulatory asset impairment charge of approximately



$254 million



(pre-tax) in the quarter ended September 30, 2013.



On appeal, on September 16, 2014, in a split decision, two judges of a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the U.S. District Court's dismissal of the complaint, agreeing that ME and PN had litigated the issue in the state proceedings and thus were precluded from subsequent litigation in federal court.



On September 30, 2014, ME and PN filed for rehearing and rehearing en banc before the Third Circuit and, on October 15, 2014, the Third Circuit rejected that rehearing request. ME and PN filed a Petition for Certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court on February 12, 2015.





Pursuant to Pennsylvania's EE&C legislation (Act 129 of 2008), the PPUC was charged with reviewing the cost effectiveness of energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs.The PPUC found the energy efficiency programs to be cost effective and directed all of the electric utilities in Pennsylvania to submit by November 15, 2012, a Phase II EE&C Plan that would be in effect










for the period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016.The PPUC deferred ruling on the need to create peak demand reduction targets and did not include a peak demand reduction requirement in the Phase II plans.On March 14, 2013, the PPUC adopted a settlement among the Pennsylvania Companies and interested parties and approved the Pennsylvania Companies' Phase II EE&C Plans for the period 2013-2016.Total costs of these plans are expected to be approximately$234 millionand recoverable through the Pennsylvania Companies' reconcilable EE&C riders.



On August 4, 2014, the Pennsylvania Companies each filed tariffs with the PPUC proposing general rate increases associated with their distribution operations.The filings request approval to increase operating revenues by approximately$151.9 millionat ME,$119.8 millionat PN,$28.5 millionat Penn, and$115.5 millionat WP based upon fully projected future test years for the twelve months ending April 30, 2016 at each of the Pennsylvania Companies.On February 3, 2015, each of the Pennsylvania Companies filed a Joint Petition for Settlement seeking PPUC approval of the agreements reached in each proceeding which included, among other things: 1) increases in current distribution revenues of $89.3 million for ME, $90.8 million for PN, $15.9 million for Penn and $96.8 million for WP; 2) a Universal Services Charge Rider to be established for WP; 3) storm reserve accounts for future storm recovery to be established for each of the Pennsylvania Companies; and 4) certain  other operational and customer service-related provisions. The sole issue reserved for briefing was with respect to the scope and pricing of the Companies' proposed LED offerings.Orders on the proposed increases are expected in May 2015.



West Virginia Regulatory Matters



On April 30, 2014, MP and PE filed a rate case, as amended on June 13, 2014, requesting a base rate increase of approximately$104 million, or9.9%, based on an historic 2013 test year.The filing also included a request for an additional$48 millionto recover by surcharge costs for new and existing vegetation management programs.On November 3, 2014, a Joint Stipulation was submitted by all parties which settled all issues in the proceeding. The settlement includes, among other things: a$15 millionincrease in base rate revenues effective February 25, 2015; the implementation of a Vegetation Management Surcharge effective February 25, 2015 to recover all costs related to both new and existing vegetation maintenance programs; authority to establish a regulatory asset for MATS investments placed into service in 2016 and 2017; authority to defer, amortize and recover over a 5-year period approximately$46 millionof storm restoration costs; and elimination of the Temporary Transaction Surcharge for costs associated with MP's acquisition of the Harrison plant in October 2013 and movement of those costs into base rates effective February 25, 2015.On February 3, 2015, the WVPSC approved the settlement in full and without modification. MP and PE's new rates will go into effect February 25, 2015.



On August 29, 2014, MP and PE filed their annual ENEC case proposing an approximate$65.8 millionannual increase in ENEC rates, which is a5.7%overall increase to existing rates.The increase is comprised of an actual$51.6 millionunder-recovered balance as of June 30, 2014, and a projected$14.2 millionin under-recovery for the 2015 rate effective period.A settlement was reached by all the parties, which was filed with the WVPSC on December 2, 2014.The parties agreed to defer $16.8 million of the energy portion of the under-recovery balance for medium and large customers for one year at a carrying cost of 4% in order to mitigate the proposed rate impact to those customers.The settlement permits MP and PE to recover all of their costs incurred during the two year review period and closes the review period except for two coal issues for further review in next year’s ENEC case.On January 29, 2015, the WVPSC approved the settlement in full without modification and new ENEC rates will go into effect February 25, 2015.



FERC Matters



PJM Transmission Rates



PJM and its stakeholders have been debating the proper method to allocate costs for new transmission facilities.While FirstEnergy and other parties advocate for a traditional "beneficiary pays" (or usage based) approach, others advocate for “socializing” the costs on a load-ratio share basis, where each customer in the zone would pay based on its total usage of energy within PJM.This question has been the subject of extensive litigation before FERC and the appellate courts, including most recently before the Seventh Circuit.On June 25, 2014, a divided three-judge panel of the Seventh Circuit ruled that FERC had not quantified the benefits that western PJM utilities would derive from certain new500kV or higher lines and thus had not adequately supported its decision to socialize the costs of these lines.The majority found that eastern PJM utilities are the primary beneficiaries of the lines, while western PJM utilities are only incidental beneficiaries, and that, while incidental beneficiaries should pay some share of the costs of the lines, that share should be proportionate to the benefit they derive from the lines, and not on load-ratio share in PJM as a whole.The court remanded the case to FERC, which issued an order setting the issue of cost allocation for hearing and settlement proceedings.Settlement discussions under a FERC-appointed settlement judge are ongoing.



Order No. 1000, issued by FERC on July 21, 2011, announced new policies regarding transmission planning and transmission cost allocation, requiring the submission of a compliance filing by PJM and the PJM transmission owners demonstrating that the cost allocation methodology for new transmission projects directed by the PJM Board of Managers satisfied the principles set forth in the order.On August 15, 2014 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit affirmed Order No. 1000, including its termination of certain "right of first refusal" privileges discussed in more detail below.The court subsequently denied a request for rehearing of its decision.












In series of orders, including certain of the orders related to the Order No. 1000 proceedings, FERC has asserted that the PJM transmission owners do not hold an incumbent “right of first refusal” to construct, own and operate transmission projects within their respective footprints that are approved as part of PJM’s RTEP process.FirstEnergy and other PJM transmission owners have appealed these rulings, and those appeals are pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.



To demonstrate compliance with the regional cost allocation principles of Order No. 1000, the PJM transmission owners, including FirstEnergy, proposed a hybrid allocation of50%beneficiary pays and50%socialized to be effective for RTEP projects approved by the PJM Board of Managers on, and after, the requested February 1, 2013 effective date of the compliance filing.FERC has accepted that approach.



Separately, the PJM transmission owners, including FirstEnergy, submitted filings to FERC setting forth the cost allocation method for projects that cross the borders between the PJM Region and: (1) the NYISO region; (2) the MISO region; and (3) the FERC-jurisdictional members of the SERTP region.These filings propose to allocate the cost of these interregional transmission projects based on the costs of projects that otherwise would have been constructed separately in each region, or, in the case of MISO, indicate that the cost allocation provisions for interregional transmission projects provided in the Joint Operating Agreement between PJM and MISO comply with the requirements of Order No. 1000.FERC accepted the PJM/MISO and PJM/SERTP filing, subject to refund and further compliance requirements.The PJM/NYISO cross-border project cost allocation filing remains pending before FERC.



The outcome of these proceedings and their impact, if any, on FirstEnergy cannot be predicted at this time.



RTO Realignment



On June 1, 2011, ATSI and the ATSI zone transferred from MISO to PJM.While many of the matters involved with the move have been resolved,FERC denied recovery under ATSI's transmission rate for certain charges that collectively can be described as "exit fees" and certain other transmission cost allocation charges totaling approximately$78.8 millionuntil such time as ATSI submits a cost/benefit analysis demonstrating net benefits to customers from the move.FERC rejected a proposed settlement agreement to resolve the exit fee and transmission cost allocation issues, stating that its action is without prejudice to ATSI submitting a cost/benefit analysis demonstrating that the benefits of the RTO realignment decisions outweigh the exit fee and transmission cost allocation charges.FirstEnergy's request for rehearing of FERC's order remains pending.



Separately, the question of ATSI's responsibility for certain costs for the “Michigan Thumb” transmission project continues to be disputed. Potential responsibility arises under the MISO MVP tariff, which has been litigated in complex proceedings before FERC and certain U.S. appellate courts. In the event of a final non-appealable order that rules that ATSI must pay these charges, ATSI will seek recovery of these charges through its formula rate.On a related issue, FirstEnergy joined certain other PJM transmission owners in a protest of MISO's proposal to allocate MVP costs to energy transactions that cross MISO's borders into the PJM Region.On January 22, 2015, FERC issued an order establishing a paper hearing on remand from the Seventh Circuit of the issue of whether any limitation on "export pricing" for sales of energy from MISO into PJM is justified in light of applicable FERC precedent.Initial comments on the MISO/PJM MVP issue are due March 9, 2015, and reply comments are due April 8, 2015.



In addition, in a May 31, 2011 order, FERC ruled that the costs for certain "legacy RTEP" transmission projects in PJM approved before ATSI joined PJM could be charged to transmission customers in the ATSI zone.The amount to be paid, and the question of derived benefits, is pending before FERC as a result of the Seventh Circuit's June 25, 2014 order described above under PJM Transmission Rates.



The outcome of those proceedings that address the remaining open issues related to ATSI's move into PJM cannot be predicted at this time.



2014 ATSI Formula Rate Filing



On October 31, 2014, ATSI filed a proposal with FERC to change the structure of its formula rate.The proposed change requested to move from an “historical looking” approach, where transmission rates reflect actual costs for the prior year, to a “forward looking” approach, where transmission rates would be based on the estimated costs for the coming year, with an annual true up.Several parties protested ATSI's filing.On December 31, 2014, FERC issued an order accepting ATSI's filing effective January 1, 2015, as requested, subject to refund and the outcome of hearing and settlement proceedings.Settlement discussions under a FERC-appointed settlement judge are ongoing.FERC also initiated an inquiry pursuant to Section 206 of the FPA into ATSI's ROE and certain other matters, with a refund effective date of January 12, 2015, for any refund resulting from the inquiry.A procedural schedule for the Section 206 inquiry has not yet been established.



California Claims Matters



In October 2006, several California governmental and utility parties presented AE Supply with a settlement proposal to resolve alleged overcharges for power sales by AE Supply to the California Energy Resource Scheduling division of the CDWR during 2001.The settlement proposal claims that CDWR is owed approximately$190 millionfor these alleged overcharges.This proposal was made in the context of mediation efforts by FERC and the Ninth Circuit in several pending proceedings to resolve all outstanding










refund and other claims, including claims of alleged price manipulation in the California energy markets during 2000 and 2001.The Ninth Circuit had previously remandedoneof those proceedings to FERC, which dismissed the claims of the California Parties in May 2011.The California Parties appealed FERC's decision back to the Ninth Circuit, where the appeal remains pending.AE Supply joined with other intervenors in the case and filed a brief in support of FERC's dismissal of the case.Oral argument was held on February 11, 2015. The matter is now before the Ninth Circuit for decision.



In another proceeding, in June 2009, the California Attorney General, on behalf of certain California parties, filed a complaint with FERC against various sellers, including AE Supply, again seeking refunds for transactions in the California energy markets during 2000 and 2001.The above-noted transactions with CDWR are the basis for including AE Supply in this complaint.AE Supply filed a motion to dismiss, which FERC granted.The California Attorney General appealed FERC's dismissal of its complaint to the Ninth Circuit, which has consolidated the case with other pending appeals related to California refund claims, and stayed the proceedings pending further order.



FirstEnergy cannot predict the outcome of either of the above matters or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



PATH Transmission Project



On August 24, 2012, the PJM Board of Managers canceled the PATH project, a proposed transmission line from West Virginia through Virginia and into Maryland which PJM had previously suspended in February 2011.As a result of PJM canceling the project, approximately$62 millionand approximately$59 millionin costs incurred by PATH-Allegheny and PATH-WV (an equity method investment for FE), respectively, were reclassified from net property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset for future recovery.PATH-Allegheny and PATH-WV requested authorization from FERC to recover the costs with a proposed ROE of10.9%(10.4%base plus0.5%for RTO membership) from PJM customers overfiveyears.FERC issued an order denying the0.5%ROE adder for RTO membership and allowing the tariff changes enabling recovery of these costs to become effective on December 1, 2012, subject to settlement judge proceedings and hearing if the parties do not agree to a settlement.On March 24, 2014, the FERC Chief ALJ terminated settlement judge procedures and appointed an ALJ to preside over the hearing phase of the case.The FERC Chief ALJ later extended the procedural schedule to allow time for the parties to address the applicability of FERC's Opinion No. 531 to the PATH proceedings.FERC's Opinion No. 531, as discussed below, revises FERC's methodology for calculating ROE.The hearing is scheduled to commence in March 2015.



MISO Capacity Portability



On June 11, 2012, in response to certain arguments advanced by MISO, FERC issued a Notice of Request for Comments regarding whether existing rules on transfer capability act as barriers to the delivery of capacity between MISO and PJM.FirstEnergy and other parties have submitted filings arguing that MISO's concerns largely are without foundation and suggested that FERC address the remaining concerns in the existing stakeholder process that is described in the PJM/MISO Joint Operating Agreement.FERC has not mandated a solution, and the RTOs and affected parties are working to address the MISO's proposal in stakeholder proceedings.In January 2015, the RTOs and affected parties indicated to FERC that discussions on the various issues are continuing. Changes to the criteria and qualifications for participation in the PJM RPM capacity auctions could have a significant impact on the outcome of those auctions, including a negative impact on the prices at which those auctions would clear.



FTR Underfunding Complaint



In PJM, FTRs are a mechanism to hedge congestion and operate as a financial replacement for physical firm transmission service.FTRs are financially-settled instruments that entitle the holder to a stream of revenues based on the hourly congestion price differences across a specific transmission path in the PJM Day-ahead Energy Market.FE also performs bilateral transactions for the purpose of hedging the price differences between the location of supply resources and retail load obligations.Due to certain language in the PJM Tariff, the funds that are set aside to pay FTRs can be diverted to other uses, resulting in “underfunding” of FTR payments.Since June 2010, FES and AE Supply have lost more than$94 millionin revenues that they otherwise would have received as FTR holders to hedge congestion costs.FES and AE Supply expect to continue to experience significant underfunding.



On February 15, 2013, FES and AE Supply filed a renewed complaint with FERC for the purpose of changing the PJM Tariff to eliminate FTR underfunding.On June 5, 2013, FERC issued its order denying the new complaint. Requests for rehearing, and all subsequent filings in the docket, are pending before FERC.The PJM stakeholders continue to discuss FTR underfunding.



A recent and related issue is the effect that certain financial trades have on congestion.On August 29, 2014, FERC instituted an investigation to address the question of whether the current rules regarding “Up-to Congestion” transactions are just and reasonable.FESC, on behalf of FES and the Utilities, filed comments supporting the investigation, arguing that PJM Tariff changes would decrease the incidence of Up-to Congestion transactions, and funding for FTRs likely would increase.FERC convened a technical conference on January 7, 2015 to discuss application of certain FTR-related rules to Up-to Congestion and virtual transactions and whether PJM’s current uplift allocation for Up-to Congestion and virtual transactions is just and reasonable. FERC action following the technical conference is pending.












PJM Market Reform: 2014 PJM RPM Tariff Amendments



In late 2013 and early 2014, PJM submitted a series of amendments to the PJM Tariff to ensure that resources that clear in the RPM auctions are available as physical resources in the delivery year and that the rules implement comparable obligations for different types of resources. PJM's filings can be grouped into four categories: (i) DR; (ii) imports; (iii) modeling of transmission upgrades in calculating geographic clearing prices; and (iv) arbitrage/capacity replacement. In each of the relevant dockets, FirstEnergy and other parties submitted comments largely supporting PJM's proposed amendments. FERC largely approved the PJM Tariff amendments as proposed by PJM regarding DR, imports, and transmission upgrade modeling. Compliance filings pursuant to and requests for rehearing of certain of these orders are pending before FERC.However, FERC rejected the arbitrage/capacity replacement amendments, directing instead that a technical conference be convened to further examine the issues.The technical conference has yet to be scheduled.



PJM Market Reform: PJM Capacity Performance Proposal and 2015/2016 Reliability Filings



On December 12, 2014, PJM submitted two filings to implement its proposed “Capacity Performance” reform of the RPM capacity market.PJM proposes to revise the PJM Tariff to, among other things:(i) adopt a modified version of the FERC-approved ISO New England Inc. capacity performance payment structure;(ii) allow no excuses for nonperformance except under certain defined circumstances;(iii) maintain DR as a supply-side resource; and(iv) impose a Capacity Performance Resource must-offer requirement (units that can perform as a Capacity Performance Resource must offer into the capacity market, except certain defined resources, including DR).PJM also proposes, among other things, to revise the PJM Operating Agreement to provide limits in energy market offers based on specific physical characteristics and to ensure that capacity resources are available when the PJM Region needs them to perform. PJM requested an effective date of April 1, 2015 for these proposed reforms.Numerous parties filed comments on and protests to PJM’s Capacity Performance filings.FESC, on behalf of its affected affiliates, and, as part of a coalition of certain other PJM utilities, filed comments and protests on the proposed reforms.PJM's filings and all related pleadings are pending before FERC.



In addition, on December 24, 2014, PJM submitted two filings seeking to ensure enough capacity is available during the 2015/2016 Delivery Year.First, PJM proposed to revise the PJM Tariff to allow PJM to procure an undetermined amount of additional capacity for the 2015/2016 Delivery Year to address reliability concerns. PJM requested an effective date of February 23, 2015 for this revision.Second, PJM requested a one-time PJM Tariff waiver that would permit PJM to keep approximately 2,000 MW of committed capacity that should be released for the third incremental auction for the 2015/2016 Delivery Year.Without the waiver, PJM would be required under the PJM Tariff to release this capacity.PJM requests an effective date of February 23, 2015 for the waiver.Numerous parties filed comments on and protests to these PJM filings.FESC, on behalf of its affected affiliates, and, as part of a coalition of certain other PJM utilities, filed comments in support of both PJM filings and seeking additional information from PJM about the scope of any capacity shortfall.PJM's filings and all related pleadings are pending before FERC.



PJM Market Reform: PJM RPM Auctions - Calculation of Unit-Specific Offer Caps



The PJM Tariff describes the rules for calculating the “offer cap” for each unit that offers into the RPM auctions.FES disagreed with the PJM Market Monitor's approach for calculating the offer caps and in 2014, FES asked FERC to determine which PJM Tariff interpretation, FES's or the PJM Market Monitor's, was correct.On August 25, 2014, FERC issued a declaratory order agreeing with the FES interpretation of the PJM Tariff language.FERC went on, however, to initiate a new proceeding to examine whether the existing PJM Tariff language is just and reasonable.PJM filed its brief explaining why the existing PJM Tariff language is just and reasonable.Other parties, including FES, submitted responsive briefs.The briefs and related pleadings are pending before FERC.



PJM Market Reform: FERC Order No. 745 - DR



On May 23, 2014, a divided three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion vacating FERC Order No. 745, which required that, under certain parameters, DR participating in organized wholesale energy markets be compensated at LMP.The majority concluded that DR is a retail service, and therefore falls under state, and not federal, jurisdiction, and that FERC, therefore, lacks jurisdiction to regulate DR.The majority also found that even if FERC had jurisdiction over DR, Order No. 745 would be arbitrary and capricious because, under its requirements, DR was inappropriately receiving a double payment (LMP plus the savings of foregone energy purchases).On January 15, 2015, FERC and a coalition of DR providers and industrial end-user groups filed separate petitions for U.S. Supreme Court review of the May 23, 2014 decision.Responses to those petitions are due March 19, 2015.The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit will withhold issuance of the mandate pending the United States Supreme Court's disposition of those petitions.



On May 23, 2014, FESC, on behalf of its affiliates with market-based rate authorization, filed a complaint asking FERC to issue an order requiring the removal of all portions of the PJM Tariff allowing or requiring DR to be included in the PJM capacity market, with a refund effective date of May 23, 2014.FESC also requested that the results of the May 2014 PJM BRA be considered void and legally invalid to the extent that DR cleared that auction because the participation of DR in that auction was unlawful in light of the May 23, 2014 U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decision discussed above.FESC, on behalf of FES, subsequently filed an amended complaint renewing its request that DR be removed from the May 2014 BRA. Specifically, FESC requested that FERC direct PJM to recalculate the results of the May 2014 BRA by:(i) removing DR from the PJM capacity supply pool;(ii) leaving the










offers of actual capacity suppliers unchanged; and then(iii) determining which capacity suppliers clear the auction on the basis of the offers they submitted consistent with the existing PJM Tariff once the unlawful DR resources have been removed.The complaint remains pending before FERC.The timing of FERC action and the outcome of this proceeding cannot be predicted at this time.



On January 14, 2015, PJM filed proposed amendments to the PJM Tariff for the purpose of addressing the uncertainty of DR.The amendments, which will become effective only in certain defined conditions, purport to be in response to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit's May 23, 2014 decision regarding FERC's jurisdiction to regulate DR, as discussed above.If implemented, the amendments will move DR from the supply side to the load side for purposes of PJM's RPM capacity markets, and will permit loads to bid load reductions into the RPM auctions occurring after April 1, 2015. On February 13, 2015, FirstEnergy, as part of a coalition, filed a protest against PJM's proposed amendments. FirstEnergy expects further filings before FERC rules on this matter.



PJM Market Reform: PJM 2014 Triennial RPM Review



The PJM Tariff obligates PJM to perform a thorough review of its RPM program every three years.On September 25, 2014, PJM filed proposed changes to the PJM Tariff as part of the latest review cycle.Among other adjustments, the filing included: (i) shifting the VRR curve one percentage point to the right, which would increase the amount of capacity supply that is procured in the RPM auctions and the clearing price; and(ii) a change to the index used for calculating the generation plant construction costs of the Net CONE formula for the future years between triennial reviews.On November 28, 2014, FERC accepted the PJM Tariff amendments as proposed, subject to a minor compliance requirement.PJM subsequently submitted the required compliance filing.On December 23, 2014, a coalition including FESC, on behalf of its affected affiliates, requested rehearing of FERC's order.PJM's compliance filing, and the coalition's and others' requests for rehearing, remain pending before FERC.



Market-Based Rate Authority, Triennial Update



The Utilities, AE Supply, FES, FG, NG, FirstEnergy Generation Mansfield Unit 1 Corp., Buchanan Generation, LLC, and Green Valley Hydro, LLC each hold authority from FERC to sell electricity at market-based rates.One condition for retaining this authority is that every three years each entity must file an update with the FERC that demonstrates that each entity continues to meet FERC’s requirements for holding market-based rate authority.On December 20, 2013, FESC, on behalf of its affiliates with market-based rate authority, submitted to FERC the most recent triennial market power analysis filing for each market-based rate holder for the current cycle of this filing requirement.On August 13, 2014, FERC accepted the triennial filing as submitted.



FERC Opinion No. 531



On June 19, 2014, FERC issued Opinion No. 531, in which FERC revised its approach for calculating the discounted cash flow element of FERC’s ROE methodology, and announced a qualitative adjustment to the ROE methodology results.Under the old methodology, FERC used a five-year forecast for the dividend growth variable, whereas going forward the growth variable will consist of two parts: (a) a five-year forecast for dividend growth (2/3 weight); and (b) a long-term dividend growth based on a forecast for the U.S. economy (1/3 weight).Regarding the qualitative adjustment, FERC formerly pegged ROE at the mid-point of the “zone of reasonableness” that came out of the ROE formula, whereas going forward, FERC may rely on record evidence to make qualitative adjustments to the outcome of the ROE methodology in order to reach a level sufficient to attract future investment.Requests for rehearing of Opinion No. 531 are currently pending before FERC.On October 16, 2014, FERC issued its Opinion No. 531-A, applying the revised ROE methodology to certain ISO New England Inc. transmission owners.FirstEnergy is evaluating the potential impact of Opinion No. 531 on the authorized ROE of our FERC-regulated transmission utilities and the cost-of-service wholesale power generation transactions of MP.



Capital Requirements

Our capital spending for2015is expected to be approximately$2.9 billion, which includes approximately$970 millionfor Regulated Transmission. Planned capital initiatives are intended to promote reliability, improve operations, and support current environmental and energy efficiency directives.



Actual capital expenditures for2014and anticipated expenditures for2015are shown in the following table. Such costs include expenditures for the improvement of existing facilities and for the construction of transmission lines, distribution lines and substations, and other assets.

(2)Excludes the capital component for pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustments, which cannot be estimated.

(3)At the Bruce Mansfield Power Station, while the plant continues to operate, if market reforms prove unsatisfactory and market conditions remain unfavorable, FirstEnergy may continue to minimize certain capital expenditures at the plant, including the delay of the new water treatment upgrades necessary for the continued operation of the plant after the LBR CCR Impoundment closes on December 31, 2016, which would reduce planned capital expenditures at FES.

FirstEnergy expects its existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its anticipated obligations and those of its subsidiaries. FirstEnergy’s business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and interest and dividend payments. FE's primary source of cash for continuing operations as a holding company is cash from the operations of its subsidiaries. During 2014, FirstEnergy received $735 million of cash dividends and capital returned from its subsidiaries and paid $604 million in cash dividends to common shareholders. In addition to internal sources to fund liquidity and capital requirements for2015and beyond, FirstEnergy expects to rely on external sources of funds. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided from operations are generally satisfied through short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs may be met through the issuance of long-term debt and/or equity. FirstEnergy expects that borrowing capacity under credit facilities will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements along with continued access to long-term capital markets.In the future, FirstEnergy may consider additional equity to fund capital investments in the Regulated Transmission business.



FE and certain of its subsidiaries participate in three five-year syndicated revolving credit facilities with aggregate commitments of $6.0 billion (Facilities), which are available until March 31, 2019. FirstEnergy had$1,799 millionand$3,404 millionof short-term borrowings under the Facilities as ofDecember 31, 2014and2013,respectively.FirstEnergy’s available liquidity under the Facilities as ofJanuary 31, 2015was$3,962 million.



In January 2015, FirstEnergy’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share of outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable March 1, 2015, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 6, 2015. This dividend equates to an indicated annual dividend of $1.44 per share and is consistent with the dividends declared in 2014.












Nuclear Operating Licenses



In August 2010, FENOC submitted an application to the NRC for renewal of the Davis-Besse operating license for an additional twenty years, until 2037.An NRC ASLB granted an opportunity for a hearing on the Davis-Besse license renewal application to a group of Intervenors, subject to admissible contentions.On September 29, 2014, the Intervenors filed a petition, accompanied by a request to admit a new contention, to suspend the final licensing decision on Davis-Besse license renewal.These filings argue that the NRC's Continued Storage Rule failed to make necessary safety findings regarding the technical feasibility of spent fuel disposal and the adequacy of future repository capacity required by the Atomic Energy Act.On October 31, 2014, FENOC and the NRC Staff filed their opposition to these requests.



The following table summarizes the current operating license expiration dates for FES' nuclear facilities in service.

Nuclear Regulation



Under NRC regulations, FirstEnergy must ensure that adequate funds will be available to decommission its nuclear facilities.As ofDecember 31, 2014, FirstEnergy had approximately$2.3 billioninvested in external trusts to be used for the decommissioning and environmental remediation of Davis-Besse, Beaver Valley, Perry and TMI-2.The values of FirstEnergy's NDTs fluctuate based on market conditions.If the value of the trusts decline by a material amount, FirstEnergy's obligation to fund the trusts may increase.Disruptions in the capital markets and their effects on particular businesses and the economy could also affect the values of the NDTs.By a letter dated July 2, 2014, FENOC submitted a$155 millionFES parental guaranty relating to a shortfall in nuclear decommissioning funding for Beaver Valley Unit 1 and Perry to the NRC for approval.FE and FES have also entered into a total of$23 millionin parental guaranties in support of the decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facilities located at the nuclear facilities.As required by the NRC, FirstEnergy annually recalculates and adjusts the amount of its parental guaranties, as appropriate.



As part of routine inspections of the concrete shield building at Davis-Besse in 2013, FENOC identified changes to the subsurface laminar cracking condition originally discovered in 2011.These inspections revealed that the cracking condition had propagated a small amount in select areas.FENOC's analysis confirms that the building continues to maintain its structural integrity, and its ability to safely perform all of its functions.On September 2, 2014, the Intervenors in the Davis-Besse license renewal proceeding requested that the ASLB introduce issues based on FENOC's plans to manage the subsurface laminar cracking in the Davis-Besse shield building.On January 15, 2015, the ASLB denied this request.The NRC continues to evaluate FENOC's analysis of the shield building.



On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued orders requiring safety enhancements at U.S. reactors based on recommendations from the lessons learned Task Force review of the accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.These orders require additional mitigation strategies for beyond-design-basis external events, and enhanced equipment for monitoring water levels in spent fuel pools.The NRC also requested that licensees including FENOC: re-analyze earthquake and flooding risks using the latest information available; conduct earthquake and flooding hazard walkdowns at their nuclear plants; assess the ability of current communications systems and equipment to perform under a prolonged loss of onsite and offsite electrical power; and assess plant staffing levels needed to fill emergency positions.These and other NRC requirements adopted as a result of the accident at Fukushima Daiichi are likely to result in additional material costs from plant modifications and upgrades at FENOC's nuclear facilities.



Nuclear Insurance



The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with respect to a nuclear power plant to$13.6 billion(assuming104units licensed to operate) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by: (i) private insurance amounting to$375 million; and (ii)$13.2 billionprovided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by the NRC pursuant thereto.Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess of private insurance, up to$127 million(but not more than$19 millionper unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising out of the incident.Based on their present nuclear ownership and leasehold interests, FirstEnergy’s maximum potential assessment under these provisions would be$509 million(NG-$501 million) per incident but not more than$76 million(NG-$75 million) in any one year for each incident.



In addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, FirstEnergy has also obtained insurance coverage in limited amounts for economic loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents.FirstEnergy is a member of NEIL, which provides coverage (NEIL I) for the extra expense of replacement power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units.Under NEIL I, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries have policies, renewable annually, corresponding to their respective










nuclear interests, which provide an aggregate indemnity of up to approximately$1.96 billion(NG-$1.93 billion) for replacement power costs incurred during an outage after an initial 20-week waiting period.Members of NEIL I pay annual premiums and are subject to assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer.FirstEnergy’s present maximum aggregate assessment for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy year would be approximately$14 million(NG-$13 million).



FirstEnergy is insured as to its respective nuclear interests under property damage insurance provided by NEIL to the operating company for each plant.Under these arrangements, up to$2.75 billionof coverage for decontamination costs, decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property is provided.FirstEnergy pays annual premiums for this coverage and is liable for retrospective assessments of up to approximately$74 million(NG-$72 million).



FirstEnergy intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long as it is available.To the extent that replacement power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of FirstEnergy’s plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by FirstEnergy’s insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the future, FirstEnergy would remain at risk for such costs.



The NRC requires nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum property insurance coverage of$1.06 billionor the amount generally available from private sources, whichever is less.The proceeds of this insurance are required to be used first to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and stable condition and can be maintained in that condition so as to prevent any significant risk to the public health and safety.Within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is required to prepare and submit to the NRC a cleanup plan for approval.The plan is required to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence decommissioning.Any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those decontamination operations that are ordered by the NRC.FirstEnergy is unable to predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of insurance proceeds.



Environmental Matters



Various federal, state and local authorities regulate FirstEnergy with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters.Compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent that FirstEnergy competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and, therefore, do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply, with such regulations.



Clean Air Act



FirstEnergy complies with SO




and NOx emission reduction requirements under the CAA and SIP(s) by burning lower-sulfur fuel, utilizing combustion controls and post-combustion controls, generating more electricity from lower or non-emitting plants and/or using emission allowances.



CAIR requires reductions of NOx and SO




emissions in



two



phases (2009/2010 and 2015), ultimately capping SO




emissions in affected states to



2.5 million



tons annually and NOx emissions to



1.3 million



tons annually.



In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decided that CAIR violated the CAA but allowed CAIR to remain in effect to “temporarily preserve its environmental values” until the EPA replaced CAIR with a new rule consistent with the Court's decision.



In July 2011, the EPA finalized CSAPR, to replace CAIR, requiring reductions of NOx and SO




emissions in



two

phases (2012 and 2014), ultimately capping SO


emissions in affected states to

2.4 million



tons annually and NOx emissions to



1.2 million



tons annually.



CSAPR allows trading of NOx and SO




emission allowances between power plants located in the same state and interstate trading of NOx and SO




emission allowances with some restrictions.



On December 30, 2011, CSAPR was stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and was ultimately vacated by the Court on August 21, 2012.



The Court subsequently ordered the EPA to continue administration of CAIR until it finalized a valid replacement for CAIR.



On April 29, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decision vacating CSAPR and generally upheld the EPA's authority under the CAA to establish the regulatory structure underpinning CSAPR.



On October 23, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lifted its stay of CSAPR allowing its Phase 1 reductions of NOx and SO




emissions to begin in 2015, a three year delay from EPA's original rule.



CSAPR Phase 2 will also be delayed by three years to 2017.



Depending on the outcome of further proceedings in this matter and how the EPA and the states implement the final rules, the future cost of compliance may be substantial and changes to FirstEnergy's and FES' operations may result.



MATS imposes emission limits for mercury, PM, and HCL for all existing and new coal-fired electric generating units effective in April 2015 with averaging of emissions from multiple units located at a single plant.Under the CAA, state permitting authorities can grant an additional compliance year through April 2016, as needed, including instances when necessary to maintain reliability where electric generating units are being closed.On December 28, 2012, the WVDEP granted a conditional extension through April 16, 2016 for MATS compliance at the Fort Martin, Harrison and Pleasants stations.On March 20, 2013, the PA DEP granted an extension through April 16, 2016 for MATS compliance at the Hatfield's Ferry and Bruce Mansfield stations.In December 2014, FG requested an extension through April 16, 2016 for MATS compliance at the Bay Shore and Sammis stations and await a decision from OEPA.In addition, an EPA enforcement policy document contemplates up to an additional year to achieve compliance, through April 2017, under certain circumstances for reliability critical units.MATS was challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by various entities, including FirstEnergy's challenge of the PM emission limit imposed on petroleum coke boilers, such as Bay Shore Unit 1. On April 15, 2014, MATS was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, however, the Court refused to decide










FirstEnergy's challenge of the PM emission limit imposed on petroleum coke boilers due to a January 2013 petition for reconsideration still pending but not addressed by EPA.On November 25, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review MATS, specifically, to determine if EPA should have evaluated the cost of MATS prior to regulating.Depending on the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court review and how the MATS are ultimately implemented, FirstEnergy's total capital cost for compliance (over the 2012 to 2018 time period) is currently expected to be approximately$370 million(CES segment of$178 millionand Regulated Distribution segment of$192 million), of which $133 million has been spent through 2014 ($56 million at CES and $77 million at Regulated Distribution).



As of September 1, 2012, Albright, Armstrong, Bay Shore Units 2-4, Eastlake Units 4-5, R. Paul Smith, Rivesville and Willow Island were deactivated.FG entered into RMR arrangements with PJM for Eastlake Units 1-3, Ashtabula Unit 5 and Lake Shore Unit 18 through the spring of 2015, when they are scheduled to be deactivated.In February 2014, PJM notified FG that Eastlake Units 1-3 and Lake Shore Unit 18 will be released from RMR status as of September 15, 2014.FG intends to operate the plants through April 2015, subject to market conditions.As of October 9, 2013, the Hatfield's Ferry and Mitchell stations were also deactivated.



FirstEnergy and FES have various long-term coal supply and transportation agreements, some of which run through 2025 and certain of which are related to the plants described above.



FE and FES have asserted force majeure defenses for delivery shortfalls under certain agreements, and are in discussion with the applicable counterparties.



As to coal transportation agreements, FE and FES have agreed to pay liquidated damages for delivery shortfalls for 2014 in the estimated amount of $70 million.



If FE and FES fail to reach a resolution with the applicable counterparties for the agreements associated with the deactivated plants or unresolved aspects of the agreements and it were ultimately determined that, contrary to their belief, the force majeure provisions or other defenses, do not excuse or otherwise mitigate the delivery shortfalls, the results of operations and financial condition of both FirstEnergy and FES could be materially adversely impacted.



If that were to occur, FE and FES are unable to estimate the loss or range of loss.



Additionally, on July 1, 2014, FES terminated a long-term fuel supply agreement.



In connection with this termination, FES recognized a pre-tax charge of $67 million in the second quarter of 2014. In one coal supply agreement, AE Supply has asserted termination rights effective in 2015. In response to the notification of the termination, the coal supplier has commenced litigation alleging AE Supply does not have sufficient justification to terminate the agreement. There are 6 million tons remaining under the contract for delivery. At this time, FirstEnergy cannot estimate the loss or range of loss regarding the on-going litigation with respect to this agreement.



In June 2005, the PA DEP and the Attorneys General of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland filed suit against AE, AE Supply, MP, PE and WP in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania alleging, among other things, that AE performed major modifications in violation of the NSR provisions of the CAA and the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act at the coal-fired Hatfield's Ferry, Armstrong and Mitchell Plants in Pennsylvania.On February 6, 2014, the Court entered judgment for AE, AE Supply, MP, PE and WP finding they had not violated the CAA or the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act. New York, Connecticut, and Maryland withdrew their appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on December 15, 2014, concluding this litigation.This decision does not change the status of these plants which remain deactivated.



In September 2007, AE received an NOV from the EPA alleging NSR and PSD violations under the CAA, as well as Pennsylvania and West Virginia state laws at the coal-fired Hatfield's Ferry and Armstrong plants in Pennsylvania and the coal-fired Fort Martin and Willow Island plants in West Virginia.The EPA's NOV alleges equipment replacements during maintenance outages triggered the pre-construction permitting requirements under the NSR and PSD programs.On June 29, 2012, January 31, 2013, and March 27, 2013, EPA issued CAA section 114 requests for the Harrison coal-fired plant seeking information and documentation relevant to its operation and maintenance, including capital projects undertaken since 2007.On December 12, 2014, EPA issued a CAA section 114 request for the Fort Martin coal-fired plant seeking information and documentation relevant to its operation and maintenance, including capital projects undertaken since 2009.FirstEnergy intends to comply with the CAA but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



In July 2008,threecomplaints representing multiple plaintiffs were filed against FG in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking damages based on air emissions from the coal-fired Bruce Mansfield Plant.Twoof these complaints also seek to enjoin the Bruce Mansfield Plant from operating except in a “safe, responsible, prudent and proper manner.”One complaint was filed on behalf oftwenty-oneindividuals and the other is a class action complaint seeking certification as a class with theeightnamed plaintiffs as the class representatives.FG believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations made in these complaints, but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



Climate Change



There are a number of initiatives to reduce GHG emissions at the state, federal and international level.Certain northeastern states are participating in the RGGI and western states led by California, have implemented programs, primarily cap and trade mechanisms, to control emissions of certain GHGs.Additional policies reducing GHG emissions, such as demand reduction programs, renewable portfolio standards and renewable subsidies have been implemented across the nation.A June 2013, Presidential Climate Action Plan outlined goals to: (1) cut carbon pollution in America by17%by 2020 (from 2005 levels); (2) prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change; and (3) lead international efforts to combat global climate change and prepare for its impacts.GHG emissions have already been reduced by 10% between 2005 and 2012 according to an April, 2014 EPA Report.In a joint announcement on November 12, 2014, President Obama stated a U.S. target of reducing GHG emissions by 26 to 28% by 2025 from 2005 emission levels and China's President stated its GHG emissions will "peak", around 2030 with approximately 20% of its










energy generated by non-fossil fuels by that same year.Due to plant deactivations and increased efficiencies, FirstEnergy anticipates its CO2emissions will be reduced 25% below 2005 levels by 2015, exceeding the President’s Climate Action Plan goals both in terms of timing and reduction levels.



EPA released its final “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under the Clean Air Act” in December 2009, concluding that concentrations of several key GHGs constitutes an "endangerment" and may be regulated as "air pollutants" under the CAA and mandated measurement and reporting of GHG emissions from certain sources, including electric generating plants.



EPA proposed a new source performance standard in September 2013, which would not apply to any existing, modified, or reconstructed fossil fuel generating units, of 1,000 lbs. CO


/MWH for large natural gas fired units (> 850 mmBTU/hr), and 1,100 lbs. CO


/MWH for other natural gas fired units (≤ 850 mmBTU/hr), and 1,100 lbs. CO


/MWH for fossil fuel fired units which would require partial carbon capture and storage.



EPA proposed regulations in June 2014, to reduce CO




emissions from existing fossil fuel electric generating units that would require each state to develop state implementation plans by June 30, 2016, to meet EPA's state specific CO




emission rate goals.



EPA's proposal allows states to request a 1-year extension for single-SIPs (June 30, 2017) or a 2-year extension for multi-state SIPs (June 30, 2018).



EPA also proposed separate regulations imposing additional CO




emission limits on modified and reconstructed fossil fuel electric generating units.



On January 7, 2015, EPA announced it would complete all of these so-called "Carbon Pollution Standards" by "midsummer" 2015.



On June 23, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court decided that CO




or other GHG emissions alone cannot trigger permitting requirements under the CAA, but that air emission sources that need PSD permits due to other regulated air pollutants can be required by EPA to install GHG control technologies.



On November 13, 2014, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit scheduled expedited briefing to consider challenges to prevent EPA from regulating CO




emissions from existing fossil fuel electric generating units.



Depending on the outcome of appeals and how any final rules are ultimately implemented, the future cost of compliance may be substantial.



At the international level, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change resulted in the Kyoto Protocol requiring participating countries, which does not include the U.S., to reduce GHGs commencing in 2008 and has been extended through 2020.FirstEnergy cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies, although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting CO2emissions, or litigation alleging damages from GHG emissions, could require significant capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations.The CO2emissions per KWH of electricity generated by FirstEnergy is lower than many of its regional competitors due to its diversified generation sources, which include low or non-CO2emitting gas-fired and nuclear generators.



Clean Water Act



Various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal CWA and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy's plants.In addition, the states in which FirstEnergy operates have water quality standards applicable to FirstEnergy's operations.



The EPA finalized CWA Section 316(b) regulations in May 2014, requiring cooling water intake structures with an intake velocity greater than 0.5 feet per second to reduce fish impingement when aquatic organisms are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling water intake system to a12%annual average and requiring cooling water intake structures exceeding 125 million gallons per day to conduct studies to determine site-specific controls, if any, to reduce entrainment, which occurs when aquatic life is drawn into a facility's cooling water system.FirstEnergy is studying various control options and their costs and effectiveness, including pilot testing of reverse louvers in a portion of the Bay Shore power plant's cooling water intake channel to divert fish away from the plant's cooling water intake system.Depending on the results of such studies and any final action taken by the states based on those studies, the future costs of compliance with these standards may require material capital expenditures.



The EPA proposed updates to the waste water effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating category (40 CFR Part 423) in April 2013.The EPA proposedeighttreatment options for waste water discharges from electric power plants, of which four are "preferred" by the agency.The preferred options range from more stringent chemical and biological treatment requirements to zero discharge requirements.The EPA is required to finalize this rulemaking by September 30, 2015, under a consent decree entered by a U.S. District Court and the treatment obligations are proposed to phase-in as permits are renewed on a5-year cycle from 2017 to 2022.Depending on the content of the EPA's final rule and any final action taken by the states, the future costs of compliance with these standards may require material capital expenditures.



In October 2009, the WVDEP issued an NPDES water discharge permit for the Fort Martin Plant, which imposes TDS, sulfate concentrations and other effluent limitations for heavy metals, as well as temperature limitations.Concurrent with the issuance of the Fort Martin NPDES permit, WVDEP also issued an administrative order setting deadlines for MP to meet certain of the effluent limits that were effective immediately under the terms of the NPDES permit.MP appealed, and a stay of certain conditions of the NPDES permit and order have been granted pending a final decision on the appeal and subject to WVDEP moving to dissolve the stay.The Fort Martin NPDES permit could require an initial capital investment ranging from$150 millionto$300 millionin order to install technology to meet the TDS and sulfate limits, which technology may also meet certain of the other effluent limits.Additional technology may be needed to meet certain other limits in the Fort Martin NPDES permit.MP intends to vigorously pursue these issues but cannot predict the outcome of these appeals or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



In December 2010, PA DEP recommended a sulfate impairment designation for an approximately68mile stretch of the Monongahela River north of the West Virginia border which EPA approved in May of 2011.PA DEP subsequently recommended that the sulfate










impairment designation for the Monongahela River be removed in its bi-annual water report.The EPA approved the removal of the sulfate impairment designation for the Monongahela River on December 19, 2014.



FirstEnergy intends to vigorously defend against the CWA matters described above but, except as indicated above, cannot predict their outcomes or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



Regulation of Waste Disposal



Federal and state hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated as a result of the RCRA, as amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act.Certain coal combustion residuals, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future regulation.



In December 2014, the EPA finalized regulations for the disposal of CCRs (non-hazardous), establishing national standards regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring and protection procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to assure the safe disposal of CCRs from electric generating plants.Depending on how the final rules are ultimately implemented, the future costs of compliance with such CCR regulations may require material capital expenditures.



The PA DEP filed a 2012 complaint against FG in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania with claims under the RCRA and Pennsylvania's Solid Waste Management Act regarding the LBR CCR Impoundment and simultaneously proposed a consent decree between PA DEP and FG to resolve those claims.



On December 14, 2012, a modified consent decree was entered by the court, requiring FG to conduct monitoring studies and submit a closure plan to the PA DEP, no later than March 31, 2013, and discontinue disposal to LBR as currently permitted by December 31, 2016.



The modified consent decree also required payment of civil penalties of



$800,000



to resolve claims under the Solid Waste Management Act.



PA DEP issued a 2014 permit requiring FE to provide bonding for 45 years of closure and post-closure activities and to complete closure within a 12-year period, but authorizing FE to seek a permit modification based on "unexpected site conditions that have or will slow closure progress."



The permit does not require active dewatering of the CCRs, but does require a groundwater assessment for arsenic and abatement if certain conditions in the permit are met.



The Bruce Mansfield Plant is pursuing several options for its CCRs following December 31, 2016.



A 2013 complaint filed by Citizens Coal Counsel and other NGOs in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, against the owner and operator of a reclamation mine in LaBelle, Pennsylvania that is one possible alternative, alleged the LaBelle site is in violation of RCRA and state laws.



On July 14, 2014, Citizens Coal Council served FE, FG and NRG with a citizen suit notice alleging violations of RCRA due to beneficial reuse of "coal ash" at the LaBelle Site.



On October 10, 2013 approximately61individuals filed a complaint against FG in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia seeking damages for alleged property damage, bodily injury and emotional distress related to the LBR CCR Impoundment.The complaints state claims for private nuisance, negligence, negligence per se, reckless conduct and trespass related to alleged groundwater contamination and odors emanating from the Impoundment.FG believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations made in the complaints, but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of the above matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.A similar complaint involving approximately 26 individuals filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania has been resolved and was closed on February 9, 2015, pending the filing of a stipulation for dismissal.



FirstEnergy and certain of its subsidiaries have been named as potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites, which may require cleanup under the CERCLA.Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides that all potentially responsible parties for a particular site may be liable on a joint and several basis.Environmental liabilities that are considered probable have been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as ofDecember 31, 2014based on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, FE's and its subsidiaries' proportionate responsibility for such costs and the financial ability of other unaffiliated entities to pay.Total liabilities of approximately$125 millionhave been accrued throughDecember 31, 2014.Included in the total are accrued liabilities of approximately$85 millionfor environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants and gas holder facilities in New Jersey, which are being recovered by JCP&L through a non-bypassable SBC.FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries could be found potentially responsible for additional amounts or additional sites, but the possible losses or range of losses cannot be determined or reasonably estimated at this time.



Fuel Supply



FirstEnergy currently has long-term coal contracts with various terms to acquire approximately25.4 milliontons of coal for the year2015which is approximately100%of its estimated2015coal requirements. This contract coal is produced primarily from mines located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Montana and Wyoming. The contracts expire at various times throughDecember 31, 2030. See Environmental Matters for factors pertaining to meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired generating units.



FirstEnergy has contracts for all uranium requirements through2018and a portion of uranium material requirements through2024. Conversion services contracts fully cover requirements through2018and partially fill requirements through2024. Enrichment services are contracted for essentially all of the enrichment requirements for nuclear fuel through2020. A portion of enrichment requirements is also contracted for through2024. Fabrication services for fuel assemblies are contracted for both Beaver Valley units through2020and Davis-Besse through2025and through the current operating license period for Perry. In addition to the










existing commitments, FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for the supply of uranium and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal services.



On-site spent fuel storage facilities are currently adequate for all FENOC operating units. An on-site dry cask storage facility has been constructed at Beaver Valley sufficient to extend spent fuel storage capacity through the end of current operating licenses at Beaver Valley Unit 1 (2036) and Beaver Valley Unity 2 (2047). Davis-Besse is planning to resume dry cask storage operations in2017which will extend on-site spent fuel storage capacity through2037(end of current operating license plus a 20-year operating license extension). Perry completed plant modification for dry cask storage in2012, loaded spent fuel into dry cask storage in 2012 and 2014 (referred to as a loading campaign), and has planned to conduct additional dry cask storage loading campaigns that will provide for sufficient spent fuel storage capacity through2046(end of current operating license plus a 20-year operating license extension).



The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provided for the construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric utilities. NG has contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry. Yucca Mountain was approved in 2002 as a repository for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs. The DOE submitted the license application for Yucca Mountain to the NRC on June 3, 2008. The current Administration has stated the Yucca Mountain repository will not be completed and a Federal review of potential alternative strategies has been performed.



In light of this uncertainty, FirstEnergy has made arrangements for storage capacity as a contingency for the continuing delays of the DOE acceptance of spent fuel for disposal.



In November, 2013, the DOE was ordered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to move forward to end the fee of 1 mill per KWH utilities pay for nuclear waste disposal because the government has no defined solution as an alternative to the canceled Yucca Mountain repository. This ruling was issued due to the DOE's failure to establish a court ordered assessment to validate the appropriateness of the fee in the wake of the cancellation of the Yucca Mountain repository. Collection of the fee was suspended in May 2014.



Fuel oil and natural gas are used primarily to fuel peaking units and/or to ignite the burners prior to burning coal when a coal-fired plant is restarted. Fuel oil requirements have historically been low and are forecasted to remain so. Requirements are expected to average approximately5 milliongallons per year over the next five years. Natural gas demand at the combined cycle and peaking units is forecasted at approximately27 millioncubic feet in2015.

Supply Plan



Regulated Commodity Sourcing



Certain of the Utilities have default service obligations to provide power to non-shopping customers who have elected to continue to receive service under regulated retail tariffs. The volume of these sales can vary depending on the level of shopping that occurs. Supply plans vary by state and by service territory. JCP&L’s default service or BGS supply is secured through a statewide competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. Default service for the Ohio Companies, Pennsylvania Companies and PE's Maryland jurisdiction are provided through a competitive procurement process approved by the PUCO (under the ESP), PPUC (under the DSP) and MDPSC (under the SOS), respectively. If any supplier fails to deliver power to any one of those Utilities’ service areas, the Utility serving that area may need to procure the required power in the market in their role as a LSE. West Virginia electric generation continues to be regulated by the WVPSC.



Unregulated Commodity Sourcing



The CES segment, through FES and AE Supply, primarily provides energy and energy related services, including the generation and sale of electricity and energy planning and procurement through retail and wholesale competitive supply arrangements. FES and AE Supply provide the power requirements of their competitive load-serving obligations through a combination of subsidiary-owned generation, non-affiliated contracts and spot market transactions.



FES and AE Supply have retail and wholesale competitive load-serving obligations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey, serving both affiliated and non-affiliated companies. FES and AE Supply provide energy products and services to customers under various POLR, shopping, competitive-bid and non-affiliated contractual obligations. Geographically, most of FES’ and AE Supply's obligations are in the PJM market area where all of their respective generation facilities are located.



Regional Reliability



All of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within PJM and operate under the reliability oversight of a regional entity known as RFC. This regional entity operates under the oversight of NERC in accordance with a Delegation Agreement approved by FERC.



Competition



Within FirstEnergy’s Regulated Distribution segment, generally there is no competition for electric distribution service in the Utilities’ respective service territories in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Additionally, there has traditionally been no competition for transmission service in PJM. However, competition for non-incumbent transmission facilities in the service territory of FirstEnergy’s Regulated Transmission segment is now permitted pursuant to FERC’s Order No. 1000, subject to state and local siting and permitting approvals. This could result in additional competition to build transmission lines in the Regulated Transmission segment’s service territory while also allowing the Regulated Transmission segment the opportunity to seek to build facilities in other service territories.



FirstEnergy's CES segment participates in deregulated energy markets in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey and Illinois, through FES and AE Supply. In these markets, the CES segment competes: (1) to provide retail generation service directly to end users; (2) to provide wholesale generation service to utilities, municipalities and co-operatives, which, in turn, resell to end users; and (3) in the wholesale market.



Seasonality



The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business and weather patterns can have a material impact on FirstEnergy’s operating results. Demand for electricity in our service territories historically peaks during the summer and winter months, with market prices also generally peaking at those times. Accordingly, FirstEnergy’s annual results of operations and liquidity position may depend disproportionately on its operating performance during the summer and winter. Mild weather conditions may result in lower power sales and consequently lower earnings.



Research and Development



The Utilities, FES, FG, FENOC and ATSI participate in the funding of EPRI, which was formed for the purpose of expanding electric R&D under the voluntary sponsorship of the nation’s electric utility industry — public, private and cooperative. Its goal is to mutually benefit utilities and their customers by promoting the development of new and improved technologies to help the utility industry meet present and future electric energy needs in environmentally and economically acceptable ways. EPRI conducts research on all aspects of electric power production and use, including fuels, generation, delivery, energy management and conservation, environmental effects and energy analysis. The majority of EPRI’s R&D programs and projects are directed toward business solutions and their applications to problems facing the electric utility industry.



FirstEnergy participates in other initiatives with industry R&D consortiums and universities to address technology needs for its various business units. Participation in these consortiums helps the company address research needs in areas such as plant










operations and maintenance, major component reliability, environmental controls, advanced energy technologies, and transmission and distribution system infrastructure to improve performance, and develop new technologies for advanced energy and grid applications.
