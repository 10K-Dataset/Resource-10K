Competitive and Regulated Generation



As of February 24, 2014, FirstEnergy’s generating portfolio consists of17,848MW of diversified capacity (Competitive —14,068MW, including 885 MWs of capacity subject to RMR arrangements with PJM and Regulated —3,780MW). Of the generation asset portfolio, approximately10,113MW (56.6%), consist of coal-fired capacity;4,048MW (22.7%) consist of nuclear capacity;1,400MW (7.8%) consist of hydroelectric capacity;1,603MW (9.0%) consist of oil and natural gas units;496MW (2.8%) consist of wind and solar power arrangements; and188MW (1.1%) consist of capacity entitlements to output from generation assets owned by OVEC. All units are located within PJM and sell electric energy, capacity and other products into the wholesale markets that are operated by PJM. Within the Competitive portfolio,11,086MW consist of FES' facilities that are operated by FENOC and FG (including entitlements from OVEC, wind and solar power arrangements), except for portions of certain facilities that are subject to the sale and leaseback arrangements with non-affiliates. The corresponding output of these arrangements is available to FES through power sale agreements, and are owned directly by NG and FG, respectively. Another2,982MW of the Competitive portfolio consists of AE Supply's facilities, including713MW from AGC's Bath County, Virginia hydroelectric facility that AE Supply partially owns and67MW of AE Supply's3.01%entitlement from OVEC's generation output. FES' generating facilities are concentrated










primarily in Ohio and Pennsylvania and AE Supply's generating facilities are primarily located in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Virginia and Ohio.



Within the Regulated portfolio,200MW consist of JCP&L's50%ownership interest in the Yards Creek hydroelectric facility in New Jersey;3,580MW consist of MP's facilities, including487MW from AGC's Bath County, Virginia hydroelectric facility that MP partially owns and11MW of MP's0.49%entitlement from OVEC's generation output. MP's facilities are concentrated primarily in West Virginia.



Utility Regulation



State Regulation



Each of the Utilities' retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and other matters are subject to regulation in the states in which it operates - in Maryland by the MDPSC, in Ohio by the PUCO, in New Jersey by the NJBPU, in Pennsylvania by the PPUC, in West Virginia by the WVPSC and in New York by the NYPSC.The transmission operations of PE in Virginia are subject to certain regulations of the VSCC. In addition, under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate rates of a public utility, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the utility.



As competitive retail electric suppliers serving retail customers primarily in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey and Maryland, FES and AE Supply are subject to state laws applicable to competitive electric suppliers in those states, including affiliate codes of conduct that apply to FES, AE Supply and their public utility affiliates.In addition, if FES, AE Supply or any of their subsidiaries were to engage in the construction of significant new generation facilities in any of those states, they would also be subject to state siting authority.



Federal Regulation



With respect to their wholesale services and rates, the Utilities, AE Supply, ATSI, AGC, FES, FG, NG, PATH and TrAIL are subject to regulation by FERC. Under the FPA, FERC regulates rates for interstate sales at wholesale, transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. FERC regulations require ATSI, JCP&L, ME, MP, PE, PN, WP and TrAIL to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates, terms and conditions. Transmission facilities of ATSI, JCP&L, ME, MP, PE, PN, WP and TrAIL are subject to functional control by PJM and transmission service using their transmission facilities is provided by PJM under its open access transmission tariff. See FERC Matters below.





The nuclear generating facilities owned and leased by NG, OE and TE, and operated by FENOC, are subject to extensive regulation by the NRC. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations, maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological aspects of those stations. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the licenses. FENOC is the licensee for the operating nuclear plants and has direct compliance responsibility for NRC matters. FES controls the economic dispatch of NG’s plants. See Nuclear Regulation below.












Regulatory Accounting



The Utilities, AGC, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL recognize, as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities, costs which FERC, PUCO, PPUC, MDPSC, WVPSC and NJBPU, as applicable, have authorized for recovery/return from/to customers in future periods or for which authorization is probable. Without the probability of such authorization, costs currently recorded as regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities would have been charged to income as incurred. All regulatory assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered/returned from/to customers. Based on current ratemaking procedures, the Utilities, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL continue to collect cost-based rates for their transmission and distribution services and, in the case of PATH, for its abandoned plant, which remains regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Utilities, AGC, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL continue the application of regulatory accounting to those operations.



FirstEnergy accounts for the effects of regulation through the application of regulatory accounting to the Utilities, ATSI, PATH and TrAIL since their rates are established by a third-party regulator with the authority to set rates that bind customers, are cost-based and can be charged to and collected from customers.



An enterprise meeting all of these criteria capitalizes costs that would otherwise be charged to expense (regulatory assets) if the rate actions of its regulator make it probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue. Regulatory accounting is applied only to the parts of the business that meet the above criteria. If a portion of the business applying regulatory accounting no longer meets those requirements, previously recorded net regulatory assets are removed from the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP.



Reliability Matters



Federally-enforceable mandatory reliability standards apply to the bulk electric system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting requirements on the Utilities, FES, AE Supply, FG, FENOC, ATSI and TrAIL.NERC is the ERO designated by FERC to establish and enforce these reliability standards, although NERC has delegated day-to-day implementation and enforcement of these reliability standards toeightregional entities, including RFC.All of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within the RFC region.FirstEnergy actively participates in the NERC and RFC stakeholder processes, and otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability standards implemented and enforced by RFC.



FirstEnergy believes that it is in compliance with all currently-effective and enforceable reliability standards.Nevertheless, in the course of operating its extensive electric utility systems and facilities, FirstEnergy occasionally learns of isolated facts or circumstances that could be interpreted as excursions from the reliability standards.If and when such items are found, FirstEnergy develops information about the item and develops a remedial response to the specific circumstances, including in appropriate cases “self-reporting” an item to RFC.Moreover, it is clear that the NERC, RFC and FERC will continue to refine existing reliability standards as well as to develop and adopt new reliability standards.Any inability on FirstEnergy's part to comply with the reliability standards for its bulk power system could result in the imposition of financial penalties that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.



Maryland Regulatory Matters



PE provides SOS pursuant to a combination of settlement agreements, MDPSC orders and regulations, and statutory provisions.SOS supply is competitively procured in the form of rolling contracts of varying lengths through periodic auctions that are overseen by the MDPSC and a third party monitor.Although settlements with respect to residential SOS for PE customers expired on December 31, 2012, by statute, service continues in the same manner unless changed by order of the MDPSC.The settlement provisions relating to non-residential SOS have also expired; however, by MDPSC order, the terms of service remain in place unless PE requests or the MDPSC orders a change.PE recovers its costs plus a return for providing SOS.



The Maryland legislature in 2008 adopted a statute codifying the EmPOWER Maryland goals to reduce electric consumption by10%and reduce electricity demand by15%, in each case by 2015.PE's initial plan submitted in compliance with the statute was approved in 2009 and covered 2009-2011, the first three years of the statutory period.Expenditures were originally estimated to be approximately$101 millionfor the PE programs for the entire period of 2009-2015.Meanwhile, after extensive meetings with the MDPSC Staff and other stakeholders, on August 31, 2011, PE filed a new comprehensive plan for the second three year period, 2012-2014, that includes additional and improved programs.The 2012-2014 plan is expected to cost approximately$66 millionout of the original$101 millionestimate for the entire EmPOWER program.On December 22, 2011, the MDPSC issued an order approving PE's second plan with various modifications and follow-up assignments.PE continues to recover program costs subject to afive-year amortization.Maryland law only allows for the utility to recover lost distribution revenue attributable to energy efficiency or demand reduction programs through a base rate case proceeding, and to date such recovery has not been sought or obtained by PE.



Pursuant to a bill passed by the Maryland legislature in 2011, the MDPSC adopted rules, effective May 28, 2012, that create specific requirements related to a utility's obligation to address service interruptions, downed wire response, customer communication, vegetation management, equipment inspection, and annual reporting.The MDPSC will be required to assess each utility's compliance with the new rules, and may assess penalties of up to$25,000per day, per violation.The new rules set utility-specific










SAIDI and SAIFI targets for 2012-2015; prescribe detailed tree-trimming requirements, outage restoration and downed wire response deadlines; and impose other reliability and customer satisfaction requirements.PE has advised the MDPSC that compliance with the new rules is expected to increase costs by approximately$106 millionover the period 2012-2015.On April 1, 2013, the Maryland electric utilities, including PE, filed their first annual reports on compliance with the new rules.The MDPSC conducted a hearing on August 20, 2013 to discuss the reports, after which an order was issued on September 3, 2013, which accepted PE's filing and the operational changes proposed therein.



Following a "derecho" storm through the region on June 29, 2012, the MDPSC convened a new proceeding to consider matters relating to the electric utilities' performance in responding to the storm.



Hearings on the matter were conducted in September 2012.



Concurrently, Maryland's governor convened a special panel to examine possible ways to improve the resilience of the electric distribution system.



On October 3, 2012, that panel issued a report calling for various measures including: acceleration and expansion of some of the requirements contained in the reliability standards which had become final on May 28, 2012; selective increased investment in system hardening; creation of separate recovery mechanisms for the costs of those changes and investments; and penalties or bonuses on returns earned by the utilities based on their reliability performance.



On February 27, 2013, the MDPSC issued an order (the February 27 Order) requiring the utilities to submit several reports over a series of months, relating to the costs and benefits of making further system and staffing enhancements in order to attempt to reduce storm outage durations.



The order further requires the Staff of the MDPSC to report on possible performance-based rate structures and to propose additional rules relating to feeder performance standards, outage communication and reporting, and sharing of special needs customer information.



PE has responded to the requirements in the order consistent with the schedule set forth therein.



PE's final filing on September 3, 2013, discussed the steps needed to harden the utility's system in order to attempt to achieve various levels of storm response speed described in the February 27 Order, and projected that it would expect to make approximately



$2.7 billion



in infrastructure investments over






years to attempt to achieve the quickest level of response for the largest storm projected in the February 27 Order.



The MDPSC has ordered that certain reports of its Staff relating to these matters be provided by May 1, 2014, and otherwise has not issued a schedule for further proceedings in this matter.





New Jersey Regulatory Matters



JCP&L currently provides BGS for retail customers who do not choose a third party EGS and for customers of third party EGSs that fail to provide the contracted service.The supply for BGS, which is comprised oftwocomponents, is provided through contracts procured through separate, annually held descending clock auctions, the results of which are approved by the NJBPU.OneBGS component and auction, reflecting hourly real time energy prices, is available for larger commercial and industrial customers.The other BGS component and auction, providing a fixed price service, is intended for smaller commercial and residential customers.All New Jersey EDCs participate in this competitive BGS procurement process and recover BGS costs directly from customers as a charge separate from base rates.



On September 7, 2011, the Division of Rate Counsel filed a Petition with the NJBPU asserting that it has reason to believe that JCP&L is earning an unreasonable return on its New Jersey jurisdictional rate base.



The Division of Rate Counsel requested that the NJBPU order JCP&L to file a base rate case petition so that the NJBPU may determine whether JCP&L's current rates for electric service are just and reasonable.



In its written Order issued July 31, 2012, the NJBPU found that a base rate proceeding "will assure that JCP&L's rates are just and reasonable and that JCP&L is investing sufficiently to assure the provision of safe, adequate and proper utility service to its customers" and ordered JCP&L to file a base rate case using a historical 2011 test year.



The rate case petition was filed on November 30, 2012.



In the filing, JCP&L requested approval to increase its revenues by approximately



$31.5 million



and reserved the right to update the filing to include costs associated with the impact of Hurricane Sandy.



The NJBPU transmitted the case to the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law for further proceedings and an ALJ has been assigned.



On February 22, 2013, JCP&L updated its filing to request recovery of



$603 million



of distribution-related Hurricane Sandy restoration costs, resulting in increasing the total revenues requested to approximately



$112 million

.



On June 14, 2013, JCP&L further updated its filing to: 1) include the impact of a depreciation study which had been directed by the NJBPU; 2) remove costs associated with 2012 major storms, consistent with the NJBPU orders establishing a generic proceeding to review 2011 and 2012 major storm costs (discussed below); and 3) reflect other revisions to JCP&L's filing.



That filing represented an increase of approximately



$20.6 million



over the revenues produced by existing base rates.



Testimony has also been filed in the matter by the Division of Rate Counsel and several other intervening parties in opposition to the base rate increase JCP&L requested.



Specifically, the testimony of the Division of Rate Counsel's witnesses recommended that revenues produced by JCP&L's base rates for electric service be reduced by approximately



$202.8 million



(such amount did not address the revenue requirements associated with major storm events of 2011 and 2012, which are subject to review in the generic proceeding).



JCP&L filed rebuttal testimony in response to the testimony of other parties on August 7, 2013.



Hearings in the rate case have concluded. In the initial briefs of the parties filed on January 27, 2014, the Division of Rate Counsel recommended that base rate revenues be reduced by $214.9 million while the NJBPU Staff recommended a $207.4 million reduction (such amounts do not address the revenue requirements associated with the major storm events of 2011 and 2012). Reply briefs were filed on February 24, 2014.





On March 20, 2013, the NJBPU ordered that a generic proceeding be established to investigate the prudence of costs incurred by all New Jersey utilities for service restoration efforts associated with the major storm events of 2011 and 2012.The Order provided that if any utility had already filed a proceeding for recovery of such storm costs, to the extent the amount of approved recovery had not yet been determined, the prudence of such costs would be reviewed in the generic proceeding.On May 31, 2013, the NJBPU clarified its earlier order to indicate that the 2011 major storm costs would be reviewed expeditiously in the generic proceeding with the goal of maintaining the base rate case schedule established by the ALJ where recovery of such costs would be addressed.










The NJBPU further indicated in the May 31 clarification that it would review the 2012 major storm costs in the generic proceeding and the recovery of such costs would be considered through a Phase II in the existing base rate case or through another appropriate method to be determined at the conclusion of the generic proceeding.On June 21, 2013, consistent with NJBPU's orders, JCP&L filed the detailed report in support of recovery of major storm costs with the NJBPU.On November 15, 2013, the Division of Rate Counsel filed testimony recommending that approximately $15 million of JCP&L’s costs be disallowed for recovery.Evidentiary hearings in this proceeding were scheduled for January 2014 but were subsequently adjourned by the NJBPU before their commencement.On February 24, 2014, a Stipulation was filed with the NJBPU by JCP&L, the Division of Rate Counsel and NJBPU Staff which will allow recovery of $736 million of JCP&L’s $744 million of costs related to the significant weather events of 2011 and 2012. As a result, FirstEnergy recorded a regulatory asset impairment charge of approximately $8 million (pre-tax) as of December 31, 2013, included in Amortization of regulatory assets, net within the Consolidated Statements of Income.The agreement, upon which no other party took a position to oppose or support, is now pending before the NJBPU.Recovery of 2011 storm costs will be addressed in the pending base rate case; recovery of 2012 storm costs will be determined by the NJBPU.



Pursuant to a formal Notice issued by the NJBPU on September 14, 2011, public hearings were held in September 2011 to solicit comments regarding the state of preparedness and responsiveness of New Jersey's EDCs prior to, during, and after Hurricane Irene, with additional hearings held in October 2011.



Additionally, the NJBPU accepted written comments through October 28, 2011 related to this inquiry.



On December 14, 2011, the NJBPU Staff filed a report of its preliminary findings and recommendations with respect to the electric utility companies' planning and response to Hurricane Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm.



The NJBPU selected a consultant to further review and evaluate the New Jersey EDCs' preparation and restoration efforts with respect to Hurricane Irene and the October 2011 snowstorm, and the consultant's report was submitted to and subsequently accepted by the NJBPU on September 12, 2012.



JCP&L submitted written comments on the report.



On January 24, 2013, based upon recommendations in its consultant's report, the NJBPU ordered the New Jersey EDCs to take a number of specific actions to improve their preparedness and responses to major storms.



The order includes specific deadlines for implementation of measures with respect to preparedness efforts, communications, restoration and response, post event and underlying infrastructure issues.



On May 31, 2013, the NJBPU ordered that the New Jersey EDCs implement a series of new communications enhancements intended to develop more effective communications among EDCs, municipal officials, customers and the NJBPU during extreme weather events and other expected periods of extended service interruptions.



The new requirements include making information regarding estimated times of restoration available on the EDC's web sites and through other technological expedients.



JCP&L is implementing the required measures consistent with the schedule set out in the above NJBPU's orders.





Ohio Regulatory Matters



The Ohio Companies primarily operate under an ESP, which expires on May 31, 2014. The material terms of the ESP include:

•Generation supplied through a CBP;

•A load cap of no less than80%, so that no single supplier is awarded more than80%of the tranches, which also applies to tranches assigned post-auction;

•A6%generation discount to certain low income customers provided by the Ohio Companies through a bilateral wholesale contract with FES (FES is one of the wholesale suppliers to the Ohio Companies);

•No increase in base distribution rates through May 31, 2014; and

•A new distribution rider, Rider DCR, to recover a return of, and on, capital investments in the delivery system.



The Ohio Companies also agreed not to recover from retail customers certain costs related to transmission cost allocations by PJM as a result of ATSI's integration into PJM for the longer of thefive-year period from June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2016 or when the amount of costs avoided by customers for certain types of products totals$360 million, subject to the outcome of certain PJM proceedings.The Ohio Companies also agreed to establish a$12 millionfund to assist low income customers over the term of the ESP and agreed to additional matters related to energy efficiency and alternative energy requirements.



On April 13, 2012, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO to essentially extend the terms of their ESP fortwoyears.The ESP 3 Application was approved by the PUCO on July 18, 2012.Several parties timely filed applications for rehearing.The PUCO issued an Entry on Rehearing on January 30, 2013 denying all applications for rehearing.Notices of appeal to the Supreme Court of Ohio were filed bytwoparties in the case, Northeast Ohio Public Energy Council and the ELPC.While briefing has been completed, the matter has not yet been scheduled for oral argument.



As approved, the ESP 3 plan continues certain provisions from the current ESP including:

•Continuing the current base distribution rate freeze through May 31, 2016;

•Continuing to provide economic development and assistance to low-income customers for thetwo-year plan period at levels established in the existing ESP;

•A6%generation rate discount to certain low income customers provided by the Ohio Companies through a bilateral wholesale contract with FES (FES is one of the wholesale suppliers to the Ohio Companies);

•Continuing to provide power to non-shopping customers at a market-based price set through an auction process; and

•Continuing Rider DCR that allows continued investment in the distribution system for the benefit of customers.












As approved, the ESP 3 plan provides additional provisions, including:

•Securing generation supply for a longer period of time by conducting an auction for athree-year period rather than aone-year period, in each of October 2012 and January 2013, to mitigate any potential price spikes for the Ohio Companies' utility customers who do not switch to a competitive generation supplier; and

•Extending the recovery period for costs associated with purchasing RECs mandated by SB221 through the end of the new ESP 3 period. This is expected to initially reduce the monthly renewable energy charge for all non-shopping utility customers of the Ohio Companies by spreading out the costs over the entire ESP period.



Under SB221, the Ohio Companies are required to implement energy efficiency programs that achieve a total annual energy savings equivalent of approximately1,211GWHs in 2012 (an increase of416,000MWHs over 2011 levels),1,726GWHs in 2013,2,306GWHs in 2014 and2,903GWHs for each year thereafter through 2025.The Ohio Companies were also required to reduce peak demand in 2009 by1%, with an additional0.75%reduction each year thereafter through 2018.On May 15, 2013, the Ohio Companies filed their 2012 Status Update Report in which they indicated compliance with 2012 statutory energy efficiency and peak demand reduction benchmarks.



In accordance with PUCO Rules and a PUCO directive, on July 31, 2012 the Ohio Companies filed their three-year portfolio plan for the period January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015.



Estimated costs for the



three



Ohio Companies' plans total approximately



$250 million



over the three-year period, which is expected to be recovered in rates to the extent approved by the PUCO.



Hearings were held with the PUCO in October 2012.



On March 20, 2013, the PUCO approved the three-year portfolio plan for 2013-2015.



Applications for rehearing were filed by the Ohio Companies and several other parties on April 19, 2013.



The Ohio Companies filed their request for rehearing primarily to challenge the PUCO's decision to mandate that they offer planned energy efficiency resources into PJM's base residual auction.



On May 15, 2013, the PUCO granted the applications for rehearing for the sole purpose of further consideration of the matter.



On July 17, 2013, the PUCO denied the Ohio Companies' application for rehearing, in part, but authorized the Ohio Companies to receive



20%



of any revenues obtained from bidding energy efficiency and demand response reserves into the PJM auction.



The PUCO also confirmed that the Ohio Companies can recover PJM costs and applicable penalties associated with PJM auctions, including the costs of purchasing replacement capacity from PJM incremental auctions, to the extent that such costs or penalties are prudently incurred.



On August 16, 2013, ELPC and OCC filed applications for rehearing under the basis that the PUCO's authorization for the Ohio Companies to share in the PJM revenues was unlawful.



The PUCO granted rehearing on September 11, 2013 for the sole purpose of further consideration of the issue.





On September 16, 2013, the Ohio Companies filed with the Supreme Court of Ohio a notice of appeal of the PUCO's July 17, 2013 Entry on Rehearing related to energy efficiency, alternative energy, and long-term forecast rules stating that the rules issued by the PUCO are inconsistent with and are not supported by statutory authority.On October 23, 2013, the PUCO filed a motion to dismiss the appeal.The Ohio Companies' response was filed on November 4, 2013.The motion is still pending and additional briefing has followed. The Ohio Companies filed their merit brief with the Supreme Court of Ohio on February 24, 2014.



SB221 requires electric utilities and electric service companies in Ohio to serve part of their load from renewable energy resources measured by an annually increasing percentage amount through 2024.



The Ohio Companies conducted RFPs in 2009, 2010 and 2011 to secure RECs to help meet the renewable energy requirements established under SB221.



In September 2011, the PUCO opened a docket to review the Ohio Companies' alternative energy recovery rider through which the Ohio Companies recover the costs of acquiring these RECs and selected auditors to perform a financial and management audit.



Final audit reports filed with the PUCO generally supported the Ohio Companies' approach to procurement of RECs, but also recommended the PUCO examine, for possible disallowance, certain costs associated with the procurement of in-state renewable obligations that the auditor characterized as excessive.



Following the hearing, the PUCO issued an Opinion and Order on August 7, 2013 approving the Ohio Companies' acquisition process and their purchases of RECs to meet statutory mandates in all instances except for part of the purchases arising from one auction and directing the Ohio Companies to credit non-shopping customers in the amount of



$43.3 million

, plus interest, and to file tariff schedules reflecting the refund and interest costs within






days following the issuance of a final appealable order on the basis that the Ohio Companies did not prove such purchases were prudent.



The Ohio Companies, along with other parties, timely filed applications for rehearing on September 6, 2013.



On December 18, 2013, the PUCO denied all of the applications for rehearing. Based on the PUCO ruling, a regulatory charge of approximately $51 million, including interest, was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 included in Amortization of regulatory assets, net within the Consolidated Statement of Income.



On December 24, 2013, the Ohio Companies filed a notice of appeal and a motion for stay of the PUCO's order with the Supreme Court of Ohio.



On February 10, 2014, the Supreme Court of Ohio granted the Ohio Companies' motion for stay, which went into effect on February 14, 2014. On February 18, 2014, the Office of Consumers' Counsel and the Environmental Law and Policy Center also filed appeals of the PUCO's order.



In March 2012, the Ohio Companies conducted an RFP process to obtain SRECs to help meet the statutory benchmarks for 2012 and beyond.With the successful completion of this RFP, the Ohio Companies achieved their in-state solar compliance requirements for 2012.The Ohio Companies also held a short-term RFP process to obtain all state SRECs and both in-state and all state non-solar RECs to help meet the statutory benchmarks for 2012.The Ohio Companies recently reported that they met all of their annual renewable energy resource requirements for reporting year 2012.The Ohio Companies conducted an RFP in 2013 to cover their all-state SREC and their in-state and all-state REC compliance obligations.



The PUCO instituted a statewide investigation on December 12, 2012 to evaluate the vitality of the competitive retail electric service market in Ohio.The PUCO provided interested stakeholders the opportunity to comment ontwenty-twoquestions.The questions










posed are categorized as market design and corporate separation.The Ohio Companies timely filed their comments on March 1, 2013, and filed reply comments on April 5, 2013.On June 5, 2013, the PUCO requested additional comments and reply comments on the topics of market design and corporate separation, which the Ohio Companies timely filed on July 8, 2013 and July 22, 2013, respectively. The PUCO held a series of workshops throughout 2013, which included an en banc workshop on December 11, 2013.The PUCO Staff filed a report on January 16, 2014, which contained a limited discussion of the workshops and the PUCO Staff’s recommendations. The Ohio Companies submitted comments on February 6, 2014 and Reply Comments on February 20, 2014.



Pennsylvania Regulatory Matters



The Pennsylvania Companies currently operate under DSPs that expire on May 31, 2015, and provide for the competitive procurement of generation supply for customers that do not choose an alternative EGS or for customers of alternative EGSs that fail to provide the contracted service.The default service supply is currently provided by wholesale suppliers through a mix of long-term and short-term contracts procured through descending clock auctions, competitive requests for proposals and spot market purchases.On November 4, 2013, the Pennsylvania Companies filed a DSP that will provide the method by which they will procure the supply for their default service obligations for the period of June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2017.The Pennsylvania Companies proposed programs call for quarterly descending clock auctions to procure 3, 12, 24, and 48-month energy contracts, as well as, one RFP seeking 2-year contracts to secure SRECs for ME, PN, and Penn.Hearings on the plans are scheduled to be held March 4-7, 2014.The Pennsylvania Companies expect a decision from the PPUC by August 4, 2014.



The PPUC entered an Order on March 3, 2010 that denied the recovery of marginal transmission losses through the TSC rider for the period of June 1, 2007 through March 31, 2008, and directed ME and PN to submit a new tariff or tariff supplement reflecting the removal of marginal transmission losses from the TSC.



Pursuant to a plan approved by the PPUC, ME and PN refunded those amounts to customers over a




-month period that began in January of 2011.



On appeal, the Commonwealth Court affirmed the PPUC's Order to the extent that it holds that line loss costs are not transmission costs and, therefore, the approximately



$254 million



in marginal transmission losses and associated carrying charges for the period prior to January 1, 2011, are not recoverable under ME's and PN's TSC riders.



The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied ME's and PN's Petition for Allowance of Appeal and the Supreme Court of the United States denied ME's and PN's Petition for Writ of Certiorari.



ME and PN also filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to obtain an order that would enjoin enforcement of the PPUC and Pennsylvania court orders under a theory of federal preemption on the question of retail rate recovery of the marginal transmission loss charges.



On September 30, 2013, the U.S. District Court granted the PPUC’s motion to dismiss.



As a result of the U.S. District Court's September 30, 2013 decision, FirstEnergy recorded a regulatory asset impairment charge of approximately



$254 million



(pre-tax) in the quarter ended September 30, 2013 included in Amortization of regulatory assets, net within the Consolidated Statement of Income. The balance of marginal transmission losses was fully refunded to customers by the second quarter of 2013.



On October 29, 2013, ME and PN filed a Notice of Appeal of the U.S. District Court’s decision to dismiss the complaint with the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. On December 30, 2013, ME and PN filed a brief with the Third Circuit that explained why it was legal error for the U.S. District Court to dismiss the complaint. The PPUC filed its brief on February 3, 2014, and ME and PN filed a reply brief on February 21, 2014. Oral argument has been scheduled for April 9, 2014.





Pennsylvania adopted Act 129 in 2008 to address issues such as: energy efficiency and peak load reduction; generation procurement; time-of-use rates; smart meters; and alternative energy.Among other things, Act 129 required utilities to file with the PPUC an energy efficiency and peak load reduction plan (EE&C Plan) by July 1, 2009, setting forth the utilities' plans to reduce energy consumption by a minimum of1%and3%by May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2013, respectively, and to reduce peak demand by a minimum of4.5%by May 31, 2013.Act 129 provides for potentially significant financial penalties to be assessed on utilities that fail to achieve the required reductions in consumption and peak demand.The Pennsylvania Companies submitted a report on November 15, 2011, in which they reported on their compliance with statutory May 31, 2011, energy efficiency benchmarks.ME, PN and Penn achieved the 2011 benchmarks; however WP did not.WP could be subject to a statutory penalty of between $1 and$20 million.On July 15, 2013, the Pennsylvania Companies filed their preliminary energy efficiency and demand reduction results for the period ending May 31, 2013, indicating that all Pennsylvania Companies are expected to meet their statutory obligations.On November 15, 2013, the Pennsylvania Companies submitted their energy efficiency and peak demand reduction report for the period ending May 31, 2013, in which they indicated that all of the Pennsylvania Companies met their statutory requirements.



Pursuant to Act 129, the PPUC was charged with reviewing the cost effectiveness of energy efficiency and peak demand reduction programs.



The PPUC found the energy efficiency programs to be cost effective and in an Order entered on August 3, 2012, the PPUC directed all of the electric utilities in Pennsylvania to submit by November 15, 2012, a Phase II EE&C Plan that would be in effect for the period June 1, 2013 through May 31, 2016.



The PPUC has deferred ruling on the need to create peak demand reduction targets until it receives more information from the EE&C statewide evaluator.



Based upon information received, the PPUC has not included a peak demand reduction requirement in the Phase II plans.



The Pennsylvania Companies filed their Phase II plans and supporting testimony in November 2012.



On January 16, 2013, the Pennsylvania Companies reached a settlement with all but one party on all but one issue.



The settlement provides for the Pennsylvania Companies to meet with interested parties to discuss ways to expand upon the EE&C programs and incorporate any such enhancements after the plans are approved, provided that these enhancements will not jeopardize the Pennsylvania Companies' compliance with their required targets or exceed the statutory spending caps.



On February 6, 2013, the Pennsylvania Companies filed revised Phase II EE&C Plans to conform the plans to the terms of the settlement.



Total costs of these plans are expected to be approximately



$234 million

.



All such costs are expected to be recoverable through the Pennsylvania Companies reconcilable Phase II EE&C Plan C riders.



The remaining issue, raised by a natural gas company, involved the recommendation that the Pennsylvania Companies include in their plans incentives for natural












gas space and water heating appliances.On March 14, 2013, the PPUC approved the 2013-2016 EE&C plans of the Pennsylvania Companies, adopting the settlement, and rejecting the natural gas companies recommendations.



In addition, Act 129 required utilities to file a SMIP with the PPUC.



On December 31, 2012, the Pennsylvania Companies filed their Smart Meter Deployment Plan.



The Deployment Plan requests deployment of approximately



98.5%



of the smart meters to be installed over the period 2013 to 2019, and the remaining meters in difficult to reach locations to be installed by 2022, with an estimated life cycle cost of about



$1.25 billion

.



Such costs are expected to be recovered through the Pennsylvania Companies' PPUC-approved Riders SMT-C.



Evidentiary hearings were held and briefs were submitted by the Pennsylvania Companies and the Office of Consumer Advocate.



On November 8, 2013, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision recommending that the Pennsylvania Companies' Deployment Plan be adopted with certain modifications, including, among other things, that the Pennsylvania Companies perform further benchmarking analyses on their costs and hire an independent consultant to perform further analyses on potential savings.



On December 2, 2013, the Pennsylvania Companies submitted exceptions in which they challenged, among other things, certain recommendations in the ALJ’s decision, and requested approval of a modification to the deployment schedule so as to allow the entire Penn smart meter system (170,000 meters) to be built by the end of 2015, instead of the original proposed installation of 60,000 meters by the end of 2016. The Office of Consumer Advocate took exception to one issue and both parties filed replies to exceptions on December 12, 2013. The case is now before the PPUC for consideration.

A decision is expected during the first quarter of 2014.



In the PPUC Order approving the FirstEnergy and Allegheny merger, the PPUC announced that a separate statewide investigation into Pennsylvania's retail electricity market would be conducted with the goal of making recommendations for improvements to ensure that a properly functioning and workable competitive retail electricity market exists in the state.On April 29, 2011, the PPUC entered an Order initiating the investigation and requesting comments from interested parties onelevendirected questions concerning retail markets in Pennsylvania to investigate both intermediate and long term plans that could be adopted to further foster the competitive markets, and to explore the future of default service in Pennsylvania following the expiration of the upcoming DSPs on May 31, 2015.A final order was issued on February 15, 2013, providing recommendations on the entities to provide default service, the products to be offered, billing options, customer education, and licensing fees and assessments, among other items.Subsequently, the PPUC establishedfiveworkgroups andonecomment proceeding in order to seek resolution of certain matters and to clarify certain obligations that arose from that order.



The PPUC issued a Proposed Rulemaking Order on August 25, 2011, which proposed a number of substantial modifications to the current Code of Conduct regulations that were promulgated to provide competitive safeguards to the competitive retail electricity market in Pennsylvania.



The proposed changes include, but are not limited to: an EGS may not have the same or substantially similar name as the EDC or its corporate parent; EDCs and EGSs would not be permitted to share office space and would need to occupy different buildings; EDCs and affiliated EGSs could not share employees or services, except certain corporate support, emergency, or tariff services (the definition of "corporate support services" excludes items such as information systems, electronic data interchange, strategic management and planning, regulatory services, legal services, or commodities that have been included in regulated rates at less than market value); and an EGS must enter into a trademark agreement with the EDC before using its trademark or service mark.



The Proposed Rulemaking Order was published on February 11, 2012, and comments were filed by the Pennsylvania Companies and FES on March 27, 2012.



If implemented these rules could require a significant change in the ways FES and the Pennsylvania Companies do business in Pennsylvania, and could possibly have an adverse impact on their results of operations and financial condition.



Pennsylvania's Independent Regulatory Review Commission subsequently issued comments on the proposed rulemaking on April 26, 2012, which called for the PPUC to further justify the need for the proposed revisions by citing a lack of evidence demonstrating a need for them.



The House Consumer Affairs Committee of the Pennsylvania General Assembly also sent a letter to the Independent Regulatory Review Commission on July 12, 2012, noting its opposition to the proposed regulations as modified.





West Virginia Regulatory Matters



MP and PE currently operate under a Joint Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement reached with the other parties and approved by the WVPSC in June 2010 that provided for:



•$40 millionannualized base rate increases effective June 29, 2010;

•Deferral of February 2010 storm restoration expenses over a maximumfive-year period;

•Additional$20 millionannualized base rate increase effective in January 2011;

•Decrease of$20 millionin ENEC rates effective January 2011, providing for deferral of related costs for later recovery in 2012; and

•Moratorium on filing for further increases in base rates before December 1, 2011, except under specified circumstances.



The WVPSC opened a general investigation into the June 29, 2012, derecho windstorm with data requests for all utilities.A public meeting for presentations on utility responses and restoration efforts was held on October 22, 2012 and two public input hearings have been held.The WVPSC issued an Order in this matter on January 23, 2013 closing the proceeding and directing electric utilities to file a vegetation management plan withinsix monthsand to propose a cost recovery mechanism.This Order also requires MP and PE to file a status report regarding improvements to their storm response procedures by the same date.On July 23, 2013, MP and PE filed their vegetation management plans, which provided for recovery of costs through a surcharge mechanism.A hearing was held on December 3, 2013, and briefing followed but the WVPSC has not yet issued an opinion in this matter.












MP and PE filed their Resource Plan with the WVPSC in August 2012 detailing both supply and demand forecasts and noting a substantial capacity deficiency.



MP and PE filed a Petition for approval of a Generation Resource Transaction with the WVPSC in November 2012 that proposed a net ownership transfer of



1,476



MW of coal-fired generation capacity to MP.



The proposed transfer involved MP's acquisition of the remaining ownership of the Harrison Power Station from AE Supply and the sale of MP's minority interest in the Pleasants Power Station to AE Supply.



FERC authorized the transfers on April 23, 2013 and the financing on May 13, 2013.



A Joint Settlement Agreement was filed by the majority of parties on August 21, 2013.



On October 7, 2013, the WVPSC authorized the transaction, with certain conditions, and on October 9, 2013, the transaction closed resulting in MP recording a pre-tax impairment charge of approximately



$322 million



in the fourth quarter of 2013 to reduce the net book value of the Harrison Power Station to the amount that was permitted to be included in jurisdictional rate base.



The charge is included in Impairment of long lived assets within the Consolidated Statement of Income.



Concurrently, MP recognized a regulatory liability of approximately



$23 million



representing refunds to customers associated with the excess purchase price received by MP above the net book value of MP's minority interest in the Pleasants Power Station.



The transaction resulted in AE Supply receiving net consideration of



$1.1 billion



and MP's assumption of a



$73.5 million



pollution control note.



The



$1.1 billion



net consideration was originally financed by MP through an equity infusion from FE of approximately



$527 million



and a note payable to AE Supply of approximately



$573 million

.



The note payable to AE Supply was paid in the fourth quarter of 2013.



In accordance with the settlement, MP and PE will file a base rate case by April 30, 2014.



On November 6, 2013, the WVCAG petitioned for appeal with the West Virginia Supreme Court.



MP and PE filed their response to the WVCAG petition on December 27, 2013 and WVCAG filed its reply on January 16, 2014. Oral argument before the Supreme Court is scheduled for March 5, 2014.





FERC Matters



PJM Transmission Rates



PJM and its stakeholders have been debating the proper method to allocate costs for new transmission facilities.



While FirstEnergy and other parties advocated for a traditional "beneficiary pays" (or usage based) approach, others advocate for “socializing” the costs on a load-ratio share basis - each customer in the zone would pay based on its total usage of energy within PJM.



On August 6, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit found that FERC had not supported a prior FERC decision to allocate costs for new






kV and higher voltage facilities on a load ratio share basis and, based on that finding, remanded the rate design issue to FERC.



In an order dated January 21, 2010, FERC set this matter for a “paper hearing” and requested parties to submit written comments.



FERC identified



nine



separate issues for comment and directed PJM to file the first round of comments.



PJM filed certain studies with FERC on April 13, 2010, which demonstrated that allocation of the cost of high voltage transmission facilities on a beneficiary pays basis results in certain LSEs in PJM bearing the majority of the costs.



FirstEnergy and a number of other utilities, industrial customers and state utility commissions supported the use of the beneficiary pays approach for cost allocation for high voltage transmission facilities.



Other utilities and state utility commissions supported continued socialization of these costs on a load ratio share basis.



On March 30, 2012, FERC issued an order on remand reaffirming its prior decision that costs for new transmission facilities that are rated at






kV or higher are to be collected from all transmission zones throughout the PJM footprint by means of a postage-stamp (or socialized) rate based on the amount of load served in a transmission zone and concluding that such methodology is just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory or preferential.



On April 30, 2012, FirstEnergy requested rehearing of FERC's March 30, 2012 order and on March 22, 2013, FERC denied rehearing.



On March 29, 2013, FirstEnergy filed its Petition for Review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, and the case subsequently was consolidated for briefing and disposition before that court.



Briefing is complete, and the case will be scheduled for oral argument, with a decision currently expected in 2014.





Order No. 1000, issued by FERC on July 21, 2011, required the submission of a compliance filing by PJM or the PJM transmission owners demonstrating that the cost allocation methodology for new transmission projects directed by the PJM Board of Managers satisfied the principles set forth in the order.



To demonstrate compliance with the regional cost allocation principles of the order, the PJM transmission owners, including FirstEnergy, submitted a filing to FERC on October 11, 2012, proposing a hybrid method of



50%



beneficiary pays and



50%



postage stamp to be effective for RTEP projects approved by the PJM Board of Managers on, and after, the effective date of the compliance filing.



On January 31, 2013, FERC conditionally accepted the hybrid method to be effective on February 1, 2013, subject to refund and to a future order on PJM's separate Order No. 1000 compliance filing.



On March 22, 2013, FERC granted final acceptance of the hybrid method.



Certain parties have sought rehearing of parts of FERC's March 22, 2013 order.



These requests for rehearing are pending before FERC.



On July 10, 2013, the PJM transmission owners, including FirstEnergy, submitted filings to FERC setting forth the cost allocation method for projects that cross the borders between: (1) the PJM region and the NYISO region and; (2) the PJM region and the FERC-jurisdictional members of the SERTP region.



These filings propose to allocate the cost of these interregional transmission projects based on the costs of projects that otherwise would have been constructed separately in each region.



On the same date, also in response to Order No. 1000, the PJM transmission owners, including FirstEnergy, also submitted to FERC a filing stating that the cost allocation provisions for interregional transmission projects provided in the Joint Operating Agreement between PJM and MISO comply with the requirements of Order No. 1000.



On December 30, 2013, FERC conditionally accepted the PJM/SERTP cross-border project cost allocation filing, subject to refund and future orders in PJM's and SERTP's related Order No. 1000 interregional compliance proceedings. The PJM/NYISO and PJM/MISO cross-border project cost allocation filings remain pending before FERC. On January 16, 2014, FERC issued an order regarding the effective date of PJM's separate Order No. 1000 compliance filing, noting that it would address the merits of the comments on and protests to that filing and related compliance filings in a future order.














Numerous parties, including ATSI, FES, TrAIL, OE, CEI, TE, Penn, JCP&L, ME, MP, PN, WP and PE, have sought judicial review of Order No. 1000 before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.Briefing was completed in December 2013 and oral argument is scheduled for March 20, 2014.



The outcome of these proceedings and their impact, if any, on FirstEnergy cannot be predicted at this time.



RTO Realignment



On June 1, 2011, ATSI and the ATSI zone transferred from MISO to PJM.The move was performed as planned with no known operational or reliability issues for ATSI or for the wholesale transmission customers in the ATSI zone.While many of the matters involved with the move have been resolved,FERC denied recovery by means of ATSI's transmission rate for certain charges that collectively can be described as "exit fees" and certain other transmission cost allocation charges totaling approximately$78.8 millionuntil such time as ATSI submits a cost/benefit analysis that demonstrates net benefits to customers from the move.On December 21, 2012, ATSI and other parties filed a proposed settlement agreement with FERC to resolve the exit fee and transmission cost allocation issues.However, FERC subsequently rejected that settlement stating that its actionis without prejudice to ATSI submitting a cost/benefit analysis demonstrating that the benefits of the RTO realignment decisions outweigh the exit fee and transmission cost allocation charges.On October 21, 2013, FirstEnergy filed a request for rehearing of FERC's order.



Separately, the question of ATSI's responsibility of certain costs for the “Michigan Thumb” transmission project continues to be disputed. Potential responsibility arises under the MISO MVP tariff, which has been litigated in complex proceedings in front of FERC and certain U.S. appellate courts. The MISO and its allied parties assert that the benefits to the ATSI zone for the Michigan Thumb project are roughly commensurate with the costs that MISO desires to charge to the ATSI zone, estimated to be as much as $16 million per year. ATSI has submitted evidence that the Michigan Thumb project provides no electric benefits to the ATSI zone and, on that basis, opposes the MISO’s efforts to impose these costs to the ATSI zone loads. The MISO and its allied parties also assert that certain language in the MISO Transmission Owners Agreement requires ATSI to pay these charges. In the event of a final non-appealable order that rules that ATSI must pay these charges, ATSI will seek recovery of these charges through its formula rate. While FERC proceedings regarding whether the MISO can charge ATSI for MVP costs remain pending, on February 24, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear appeals filed by FirstEnergy and other parties of the Seventh Circuit's June 2013 decision upholding FERC's acceptance of the MISO's generic MVP cost allocation proposal.



In the May 31, 2011 order, FERC ruled that the costs for certain "legacy RTEP" transmission projects in PJM could be charged to transmission customers in the ATSI zone.ATSI sought rehearing of the question of whether the ATSI zone should pay these legacy RTEP charges and, on September 20, 2012, FERC denied ATSI's request for rehearing.ATSI subsequently filed a petition for review with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The case thereafter was briefed andoral arguments took place on December 11, 2013.A decision currently is expected in the second quarter of 2014.



The outcome of those proceedings that address the remaining open issues related to ATSI's move into PJM cannot be predicted at this time.



California Claims Matters



In October 2006, several California governmental and utility parties presented AE Supply with a settlement proposal to resolve alleged overcharges for power sales by AE Supply to the California Energy Resource Scheduling division of the CDWR during 2001.The settlement proposal claims that CDWR is owed approximately$190 millionfor these alleged overcharges.This proposal was made in the context of mediation efforts by FERC and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in several pending proceedings to resolve all outstanding refund and other claims, including claims of alleged price manipulation in the California energy markets, during 2000 and 2001.The Ninth Circuit had previously remandedoneof those proceedings to FERC, which dismissed the claims of the California Parties in May 2011, and affirmed the dismissal in June 2012.On June 20, 2012, the California Parties appealed FERC's decision back to the Ninth Circuit.Briefing was completed before the Ninth Circuit on October 23, 2013.The timing of further action by the Ninth Circuit is unknown.



In another proceeding, in June 2009, the California Attorney General, on behalf of certain California parties, filed another complaint with FERC against various sellers, including AE Supply, again seeking refunds for transactions in the California energy markets during 2000 and 2001.The above-noted transactions with CDWR are the basis for including AE Supply in this complaint.AE Supply filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted by FERC in May 2011, and affirmed by FERC in June 2012.The California Attorney General has appealed FERC's dismissal of its complaint to the Ninth Circuit, which has consolidated the case with other pending appeals related to California refund claims, and stayed the proceedings pending further order.



FirstEnergy cannot predict the outcome of either of the above matters or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



PATH Transmission Project



The PATH project was proposed to be comprised of a765kV transmission line from West Virginia through Virginia and into Maryland, modifications to an existing substation in Putnam County, West Virginia, and the construction of new substations in Hardy County, West Virginia and Frederick County, Maryland.PJM initially authorized construction of the PATH project in June 2007.On August










24, 2012, the PJM Board of Managers canceled the PATH project, which it had suspended in February 2011.As a result, approximately$62 millionand approximately$59 millionin costs incurred by PATH-Allegheny and PATH-WV, respectively, were reclassified from net property, plant and equipment to a regulatory asset for future recovery.On September 28, 2012, those companies requested authorization from FERC to recover the costs with a proposed return on equity of10.9%(10.4%base plus0.5%RTO membership) from PJM customers over the nextfiveyears.Several parties protested the request.On November 30, 2012, FERC issued an order denying the0.5%return on equity adder for RTO membership and allowing the tariff changes enabling recovery of these costs to become effective on December 1, 2012, subject to settlement judge procedures and hearing if the parties do not agree to a settlement.The issues subject to settlement include the prudence of the costs, the base return on equity and the period of recovery.PATH-Allegheny and PATH-WV are currently engaged in settlement discussions with the other parties.Depending on the outcome of a possible settlement or hearing, if settlement is not achieved, PATH-Allegheny and PATH-WV may be required to refund certain amounts that have been collected under their formula rate.



PATH-Allegheny and PATH-WV have requested rehearing of FERC's denial of the0.5%return on equity adder for RTO membership; that request for rehearing remains pending before FERC.In addition, FERC has consolidated for settlement judge procedures and hearing purposes three formal challenges to the PATH formula rate annual updates submitted to FERC in June 2010, June 2011 and June 2012, with the September 28, 2012 filing for recovery of costs associated with the cancellation of the PATH project.



Hydroelectric Asset Sale



On September 4, 2013, certain of FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries submitted filings with FERC for authorization to sellelevenhydroelectric power plant projects to subsidiaries of Harbor Hydro Holdings, LLC (Harbor Hydro), a subsidiary of LS Power Equity Partners II, LP (LS Power).Theelevenhydroelectric projects are: the Seneca Pumped Storage Project, Allegheny Lock & Dam No. 5, Allegheny Lock & Dam No. 6, the Lake Lynn Project, the Millville Hydro Project, the Dam No. 4 Project, the Dam No. 5 Project, and four additional projects located in Shenandoah, Front Royal and Luray, Virginia.Theelevenprojects have a combined generating capacity of approximately527MW.On February 12, 2014, the sale of the hydroelectric power plants to LS Power closed for approximately $395 million.See Note 20, Discontinued Operations and Assets Held for Sale for additional information regarding the assets sold.



MISO Capacity Portability



On June 11, 2012, FERC issued a Notice of Request for Comments regarding whether existing rules on transfer capability act as barriers to the delivery of capacity between MISO and PJM.



FERC is responding to suggestions from MISO and the MISO stakeholders that PJM's rules regarding the criteria and qualifications for external generation capacity resources be changed to ease participation by resources that are located in MISO in PJM's RPM capacity auctions.



FirstEnergy submitted comments and reply comments in August 2012.



In the fall of 2012, FirstEnergy participated in certain stakeholder meetings to review various proposals advanced by MISO.



Although none of MISO's proposals attracted significant stakeholder support, in January 2013, MISO filed a pleading with FERC that renewed many of the arguments advanced in prior MISO filings and asked FERC to take expedited action to address MISO's allegations.



FirstEnergy and other parties subsequently submitted filings arguing that MISO's concerns largely are without foundation and suggesting that FERC order that the remaining concerns be addressed in the existing stakeholder process that is described in the PJM/MISO Joint Operating Agreement.



On April 2, 2013, FERC issued an order directing MISO and PJM to make presentations to FERC regarding ongoing regional efforts to address whether barriers to transfer capability exist between the MISO and PJM regions and the actions the FERC should take to address any such barriers.



The RTOs presented their respective positions to FERC on June 20, 2013 and provided additional information regarding their stakeholder prioritization survey, in response to a FERC request on June 27, 2013.



On September 26, 2013, the RTOs jointly submitted an informational filing providing a description of and schedule for their Joint and Common Market initiatives.



On December 19, 2013, FERC issued an order directing that FERC staff are to attend the “joint and common market” stakeholder meetings for the purpose of monitoring progress on the initiatives described in the September 26, 2013 joint informational filing and establishing a new proceeding to reflect the broadened scope of issues contemplated by that filing and the RTOs' joint and common market initiatives.



FERC has not acted on the presentations, and the RTOs and affected parties are working to address the MISO's proposal in stakeholder proceedings.



Changes to the criteria and qualifications for participation in the PJM RPM capacity auctions could have a significant impact on the outcome of those auctions, including a negative impact on the prices at which those auctions would clear.





MOPR Reform



On December 7, 2012, PJM filed amendments to its tariff to revise the MOPR used in the RPM. PJM revised the MOPR to add two broad, categorical exemptions, eliminate an existing exemption, and to limit the applicability of the MOPR to certain capacity resources.The filing also included related and conforming changes to the RPM posting requirements and to those provisions describing the role of the Independent Market Monitor for the PJM Region.On May 2, 2013, FERC issued an order in large part accepting PJM's proposed reform of the MOPR, including the proposed exemptions and applicability but also requiring PJM to commit to future review and, if necessary, additional revisions to the MOPR to accommodate changing market conditions.On June 3, 2013, FirstEnergy submitted a request for rehearing of FERC's May 2, 2013 order.In its rehearing request, FirstEnergy referenced the results of the May 2013 PJM RPM capacity auction, and publicly-available data about the reasons for the unexpectedly low "rest-of-RTO" clearing price of $59 per MW-day, as supporting its contention that the MOPR reform depressed prices as predicted in FirstEnergy's December 28, 2012 and January 25, 2013 comments.FirstEnergy's request for rehearing is pending before FERC.












FTR Underfunding Complaint



In PJM, FTRs are a mechanism to hedge congestion and they operate as a financial replacement for physical firm transmission service.FTRs are financially-settled instruments that entitle the holder to a stream of revenues based on the hourly congestion price differences across a specific transmission path in the PJM Day-ahead Energy Market.FE also performs bilateral transactions for the purpose of hedging the price differences between the location of supply resources and retail load obligations.Due to certain language in the PJM tariff, the funds that are set aside to pay FTRs can be diverted to other uses, resulting in “underfunding” of FTR payments.Since June of 2010, FES and AE Supply have lost more than$65.5 millionin revenues that they otherwise would have received as FTR holders to hedge congestion costs.FES and AE Supply expect to continue to experience significant underfunding.



On December 28, 2011, FES and AE Supply filed a complaint with FERC for the purpose of modifying certain provisions in the PJM tariff to eliminate FTR underfunding.On March 2, 2012, FERC issued an order dismissing the complaint.In its order, FERC ruled that it was not appropriate to initiate action at that time because of the unknown root causes of FTR underfunding.FERC directed PJM to convene stakeholder proceedings for the purpose of determining the root causes of the FTR underfunding.FERC went on to note that its dismissal of the complaint was without prejudice to FES and AE Supply or any other affected entity filing a complaint if the stakeholder proceedings proved unavailing.FES and AE Supply sought rehearing of FERC's order and, on July 19, 2012, FERC denied rehearing.In April, 2012, PJM issued a report on FTR underfunding.However, the PJM stakeholder process proved unavailing as the stakeholders were not willing to change the tariff to eliminate FTR underfunding.Accordingly, on February 15, 2013, FES and AE Supply refiled their complaint with FERC for the purpose of changing the PJM tariff to eliminate FTR underfunding.Various parties filed responsive pleadings, including PJM.On June 5, 2013, FERC issued its order denying the new complaint.On July 5, 2013, FirstEnergy filed a request for rehearing of FERC's order.FES and AE Supply's request for rehearing, and all subsequent filings in the docket, are pending before FERC.



PJM RPM Tariff Amendments



In November 2013, PJM began to submit a series of amendments to its RPM capacity tariff in order to address certain problems that have been observed in recent auctions. These problems can be grouped into three categories: (i) Demand Response (DR); (ii) imports; and (iii) modeling of transmission upgrades in calculating geographic clearing prices. The purpose of PJM’s tariff amendments is to ensure that resources that clear in the RPM auctions are available and able to satisfy all obligations under the PJM tariffs. In each of the affected dockets, FirstEnergy submitted comments as part of a coalition of utilities (generally including an affiliate of AEP, Duke and Dayton). The FirstEnergy/coalition position was that all of the PJM proposals should be accepted as proposed, and that the FERC should order PJM to take additional steps that should have the effect of eliminating additional distortions and flaws in the RPM market. FERC issued deficiency letters requesting additional information from PJM regarding the imports and modeling filings, and on January 30, 2014 accepted the DR filing as proposed. On February 18 and 21, 2014, respectively, PJM filed its responses to FERC's deficiency letters regarding the modeling and imports filings. PJM's compliance filings and all other filings in the dockets are pending before FERC.



Market-Based Rate Authority, Triennial Update



OE, CEI, TE, Penn, JCP&L, ME, PN, MP, WP, PE, AE Supply, FES, FG, NG, FirstEnergy Generation Mansfield Unit 1 Corp., Buchanan Generation, LLC, and Green Valley Hydro, LLC each hold authority from FERC to sell electricity at market-based rates. One condition for retaining this authority is that every three years each entity must file an update with the FERC that demonstrates that each entity continues to meet FERC’s requirements for holding market-based rate authority. On December 20, 2013, FESC submitted to FERC the most recent triennial market power analysis filing for each market-based rate holder for the current cycle of this filing requirement. That filing is pending before FERC.



Capital Requirements

Our capital spending for2014is expected to be approximately$3.3 billion(excluding nuclear fuel), which includes spending associated with our announced transmission plan. Planned capital initiatives are intended to promote reliability, improve operations, and support current environmental and energy efficiency directives. Our capital investments for additional nuclear fuel are expected to be$238 millionin2014.



Actual capital expenditures for2013and anticipated expenditures for2014, excluding nuclear fuel, are shown in the following table. Such costs include expenditures for the improvement of existing facilities and for the construction of transmission lines, distribution lines and substations, and other assets.

FirstEnergy expects its existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its anticipated obligations and those of its subsidiaries. FirstEnergy’s business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities and interest and dividend payments. In addition to internal sources to fund liquidity and capital requirements for2014and beyond, FirstEnergy expects to rely on external sources of funds. Short-term cash requirements not met by cash provided from operations are generally satisfied through short-term borrowings. Long-term cash needs may be met through the issuance of long-term debt and/or equity. FirstEnergy expects that borrowing capacity under credit facilities will continue to be available to manage working capital requirements along with continued access to long-term capital markets.



FirstEnergy had$3,404 millionand$1,969 millionof short-term borrowings as ofDecember 31, 2013andDecember 31, 2012,respectively.FirstEnergy’s available liquidity as ofJanuary 31, 2014, was as follows:

FE and certain of its subsidiaries participate in three five-year syndicated revolving credit facilities with aggregate commitments of$6.0 billion(Facilities). The Facilities consist of a$2.5 billionaggregate FirstEnergy Facility, a$2.5 billionFES/AE Supply Facility and a$1.0 billionFET Facility, that are each available until May 2018, unless the lenders agree, at the request of the applicable borrowers, to an additional one-year extension. Generally, borrowings under each of the Facilities are available to each borrower separately and mature on the earlier of 364 days from the date of borrowing or the commitment termination date, as the same may be extended.



On May 8, 2013, FE, FES, AE Supply and FE's other borrowing subsidiaries entered into extensions and amendments to the three existing multi-year syndicated revolving credit facilities. Each facility was extended until May 2018, unless the lenders agree, at the request of the applicable borrowers, to an additional one-year extension. The FE Facility was amended to increase the lending banks' commitments under the facility by $500 million to a total of $2.5 billion and to increase the individual borrower sub-limits for FE by $500 million to a total of $2.5 billion and for JCP&L by $175 million to a total of $600 million.



On October 31, 2013, FE amended its existing $2.5 billion multi-year syndicated revolving credit facility to exclude certain after-tax, non-cash write-downs and non-cash charges of approximately $1.4 billion (primarily related to Pension and OPEB mark-to-market adjustments, impairment of long-lived assets and regulatory charges) from the debt to total capitalization ratio calculations incurred through September 30, 2013. Additionally, the amendment provides for a future allowance of approximately $1.35 billion for after-tax, non-cash write-downs and non-cash charges over the remaining life of the facility. Similarly, the FES/AE Supply $2.5 billion revolving credit facility was also amended to exclude certain similar after-tax, non-cash write-downs and non-cash charges of $785.7 million incurred through September 30, 2013 from the debt to total capitalization ratio calculations. As of December 31, 2013, the borrowers were in compliance with the applicable debt to total capitalization ratios under the respective Facilities.



The Facilities do not contain provisions that restrict the ability to borrow or accelerate payment of outstanding advances in the event of any change in credit ratings of the borrowers. Pricing is defined in “pricing grids,” whereby the cost of funds borrowed under the Facilities is related to the credit ratings of the company borrowing the funds, other than the FET Facility, which is based on its










subsidiaries' credit ratings. Additionally, borrowings under each of the Facilities are subject to the usual and customary provisions for acceleration upon the occurrence of events of default, including a cross-default for other indebtedness in excess of$100 million.

During December of 2013, FE entered into an agreement to extend and amend its$150 millionterm loan agreement with a maturity date of December 31, 2014. The maturity of the loan was extended to December 31, 2015 and the principal amount was increased to$200 million.



FE’s primary source of cash for continuing operations as a holding company is cash from the operations of its subsidiaries. During2013, FirstEnergy received$686 millionof cash dividends and capital returned from its subsidiaries and paid$920 millionin cash dividends to common shareholders.In January 2014, FirstEnergy’s Board of Directors declared a revised quarterly dividend of $0.36 per share of outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable March 1, 2014, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 7, 2014. This revised dividend equates to an indicated annual dividend of $1.44 per share, reduced from the $0.55 per share quarterly dividend ($2.20 per share annually) that FirstEnergy had paid since 2008.



Nuclear Operating Licenses



In August 2010, FENOC submitted an application to the NRC for renewal of the Davis-Besse operating license for an additional twenty years, until 2037.



An NRC ASLB granted a hearing on the Davis-Besse license renewal application to a group of petitioners.



On July 9, 2012, the petitioners' proposed a contention on the environmental impacts of spent fuel storage in the Davis-Besse license renewal proceeding.



In an order dated August 7, 2012, the NRC stated that it will not issue final licensing decisions until it has appropriately addressed the challenges to the NRC Waste Confidence Decision and Temporary Storage Rule and all pending contentions on this topic should be held in abeyance.



The ASLB has suspended further consideration of the petitioners' proposed contention on the environmental impacts of spent fuel storage at Davis-Besse.



The NRC Staff issued Waste Confidence Draft Generic Environmental Impact Statement and published a proposed rule on this subject in September of 2013.



Other contentions proposed by the petitioners in this proceeding have been rejected by the ASLB. On February 18, 2014, Beyond Nuclear and Don't Waste Michigan, two of the petitioners in the Davis-Besse license renewal proceeding, requested that the NRC institute a rulemaking on the environmental impacts of high density spent fuel storage and mitigation alternatives. On February 27, 2014, these petitioners requested a suspension of the licensing decision in the Davis-Besse license renewal proceeding to allow the NRC to complete this rulemaking.

Nuclear Regulation



Under NRC regulations, FirstEnergy must ensure that adequate funds will be available to decommission its nuclear facilities.As ofDecember 31, 2013, FirstEnergy had approximately$2.2 billioninvested in external trusts to be used for the decommissioning and environmental remediation of Davis-Besse, Beaver Valley, Perry and TMI-2.The values of FirstEnergy's NDT fluctuate based on market conditions.If the value of the trusts decline by a material amount, FirstEnergy's obligation to fund the trusts may increase.Disruptions in the capital markets and their effects on particular businesses and the economy could also affect the values of the NDT.FE maintains a$125 millionparental guaranty relating to a potential shortfall in nuclear decommissioning funding for Beaver Valley Unit 1 and Perry.FE also maintains an$11 millionparental guaranty in support of the decommissioning of the spent fuel storage facilities located at its Davis-Besse and Perry nuclear facilities.As required by the NRC, FirstEnergy annually recalculates and adjusts the amount of its parental guaranty, as appropriate.



On October 4, 2013, during a refueling outage for Beaver Valley Unit 1, FENOC conducted a planned visual examination of the interior containment liner and coatings.The containment design for Beaver Valley includes an interior steel liner that is surrounded by reinforced concrete.A penetration through the containment steel liner plate of approximately 0.4 inches by 0.28 inches was discovered.A detailed investigation was initiated, including laboratory analysis that has indicated that the degraded area was initiated by foreign material inadvertently left in the concrete during construction.An assessment has been performed which concluded that any postulated leakage through the affected area was within overall allowable limits for the containment building.The structural integrity of the containment building is not affected.Repair of the containment liner was completed and Unit 1 was returned to service on November 4, 2013.



As part of routine inspections of the concrete shield building at Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station in 2013, FENOC identified changes to the subsurface laminar cracking condition originally discovered in 2011. The shield building is a 21/2-foot thick reinforced concrete structure that provides biological shielding, protection from natural phenomena including wind and tornadoes and additional shielding in the event of an accident.FENOC then expanded its sample size to include all of the existing core bores in the shield building.These inspections, which are now complete,identified additional subsurface cracking that was determined to be pre-existing, but only now identified with the aid of improved inspection technology.These inspections also revealed that the cracking










condition has propagated a small amount in select areas.Preliminary analysis of the inspections results confirm that the building continues to maintain its structural integrity, and its ability to safely perform all of its functions.



On February 1, 2014, the Davis-Besse Nuclear Power Station entered into an outage to install two new steam generators, replace about a third of the unit’s 177 fuel assemblies and perform numerous safety inspections and preventative maintenance activities. During the preliminary stages of the outage an area of concrete that was not filled to the expected thickness within the shield building wall was discovered at the top of the temporary construction opening that was created as part of the 2011 outage. The 2011 temporary construction opening was created to install the new reactor head. FENOC has assessed the as-found condition of the concrete and has determined the shield building would have performed its design functions. This condition within the shield building wall will be repaired during this outage to conform to its original design configuration. This condition is not expected to extend the outage.



On March 12, 2012, the NRC issued orders requiring safety enhancements at U.S. reactors based on recommendations from the lessons learned Task Force review of the accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.These orders require additional mitigation strategies for beyond-design-basis external events, and enhanced equipment for monitoring water levels in spent fuel pools.The NRC also requested that licensees including FENOC: re-analyze earthquake and flooding risks using the latest information available; conduct earthquake and flooding hazard walkdowns at their nuclear plants; assess the ability of current communications systems and equipment to perform under a prolonged loss of onsite and offsite electrical power; and assess plant staffing levels needed to fill emergency positions.These and other NRC requirements adopted as a result of the accident at Fukushima Daiichi are likely to result in additional material costs from plant modifications and upgrades at FENOC's nuclear facilities.



Nuclear Insurance



The Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with respect to a nuclear power plant to$13.6 billion(assuming104units licensed to operate) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by: (i) private insurance amounting to$375 million; and (ii)$13.2 billionprovided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by the NRC pursuant thereto.Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of a nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in excess of private insurance, up to$127 million(but not more than$19 millionper unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising out of the incident.Based on their present nuclear ownership and leasehold interests, FirstEnergy’s maximum potential assessment under these provisions would be$509 million(OE-$44 million, NG-$442 million, and TE-$23 million) per incident but not more than$76 million(OE-$7 million, NG-$66 million, and TE-$3 million) in any one year for each incident.



In addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to the Price-Anderson Act, FirstEnergy has also obtained insurance coverage in limited amounts for economic loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents.FirstEnergy is a member of NEIL, which provides coverage (NEIL I) for the extra expense of replacement power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages of nuclear units.Under NEIL I, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries have policies, renewable yearly, corresponding to their respective nuclear interests, which provide an aggregate indemnity of up to approximately$2 billion(OE-$168 million, NG-$1.7 billion, TE-$90 million) for replacement power costs incurred during an outage after an initial 20-week waiting period.Members of NEIL I pay annual premiums and are subject to assessments if losses exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer.FirstEnergy’s present maximum aggregate assessment for incidents at any covered nuclear facility occurring during a policy year would be approximately$14 million(OE-$1.2 million, NG-$12 millionand TE-$0.6 million).



FirstEnergy is insured as to its respective nuclear interests under property damage insurance provided by NEIL to the operating company for each plant.Under these arrangements, up to$2.75 billionof coverage for decontamination costs, decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property is provided.FirstEnergy pays annual premiums for this coverage and is liable for retrospective assessments of up to approximately$79 million(OE-$7 million, NG-$68 million, TE-$3 millionand ME-$1 million).



FirstEnergy intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long as it is available.To the extent that replacement power, property damage, decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of FirstEnergy’s plants exceed the policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by FirstEnergy’s insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the future, FirstEnergy would remain at risk for such costs.



The NRC requires nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum property insurance coverage of$1.06 billionor the amount generally available from private sources, whichever is less.The proceeds of this insurance are required to be used first to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and stable condition and can be maintained in that condition so as to prevent any significant risk to the public health and safety.Within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is required to prepare and submit to the NRC a cleanup plan for approval.The plan is required to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the reactor sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence decommissioning.Any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those decontamination operations that are ordered by the NRC.FirstEnergy is unable to predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of insurance proceeds.












Environmental Matters



Various federal, state and local authorities regulate FirstEnergy with regard to air and water quality and other environmental matters.Compliance with environmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent that FirstEnergy competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and, therefore, do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply, with such regulations.



CAA Compliance



FirstEnergy is required to meet federally-approved SO2and NOx emissions regulations under the CAA.FirstEnergy complies with SO2and NOx reduction requirements under the CAA and SIP(s) by burning lower-sulfur fuel, utilizing combustion controls and post-combustion controls, generating more electricity from lower or non-emitting plants and/or using emission allowances.



In July 2008,threecomplaints representing multiple plaintiffs were filed against FG in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking damages based on air emissions from the coal-fired Bruce Mansfield Plant.Twoof these complaints also seek to enjoin the Bruce Mansfield Plant from operating except in a “safe, responsible, prudent and proper manner.”One complaint was filed on behalf oftwenty-oneindividuals and the other is a class action complaint seeking certification as a class with theeightnamed plaintiffs as the class representatives.FG believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations made in these complaints, but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



In January 2009, the EPA issued an NOV to GenOn Energy, Inc. alleging NSR violations at the Keystone, Portland and Shawville coal-fired plants based on “modifications” dating back to the mid-1980s.JCP&L, as the former owner of 16.67% of the Keystone Station, ME, as a former owner and operator of the Portland Station, and PN as former owner and operator of the Shawville Station, are unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



In January 2011, the U.S. DOJ filed a complaint against PN in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking injunctive relief against PN based on alleged “modifications” at the coal-fired Homer City generating plant during 1991 to 1994 without pre-construction NSR permitting in violation of the CAA's PSD and Title V permitting programs.



The complaint was also filed against the former co-owner, NYSEG, and various current owners of Homer City, including EME Homer City Generation L.P. and affiliated companies, including Edison International.



In addition, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the states of New Jersey and New York intervened and filed separate complaints regarding Homer City seeking injunctive relief and civil penalties.



In October 2011, the Court dismissed all of the claims with prejudice of the U.S. DOJ and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the states of New Jersey and New York against all of the defendants, including PN.



In December 2011, the U.S., the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the states of New Jersey and New York all filed notices appealing to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals which affirmed the dismissal on August 21, 2013 and then denied petitions for rehearing on December 12, 2013.



PN believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself against the allegations made in these complaints.



The parties dispute the scope of NYSEG's and PN's indemnity obligation to and from Edison International.



PN is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the loss or possible range of loss.





In August 2009, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation and NOV alleging violations of the CAA and Ohio regulations, including the PSD, NNSR and Title V regulations, at the Eastlake, Lakeshore, Bay Shore and Ashtabula coal-fired plants.The EPA's NOV alleges equipment replacements during maintenance outages dating back to 1990 triggered the pre-construction permitting requirements under the PSD and NNSR programs.In June 2011, EPA issued another Finding of Violation and NOV alleging violations of the CAA and Ohio regulations, specifically, opacity limitations and requirements to continuously operate opacity monitoring systems at the Eastlake, Lakeshore, Bay Shore and Ashtabula coal-fired plants.FG intends to comply with the CAA and Ohio regulations, but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



In August 2000, AE received an information request pursuant to section 114(a) of the CAA from the EPA requesting that it provide information and documentation relevant to the operation and maintenance of the followingtencoal-fired plants, which collectively include22electric generation units: Albright, Armstrong, Fort Martin, Harrison, Hatfield's Ferry, Mitchell, Pleasants, Rivesville, R. Paul Smith and Willow Island to determine compliance with the NSR provisions under the CAA, which can require the installation of additional air emission control equipment when a major modification of an existing facility results in an increase in emissions.In September 2007, AE received an NOV from the EPA alleging NSR and PSD violations under the CAA, as well as Pennsylvania and West Virginia state laws at the coal-fired Hatfield's Ferry and Armstrong plants in Pennsylvania and the coal-fired Fort Martin and Willow Island plants in West Virginia.On June 29, 2012, January 31, 2013, and March 27, 2013, EPA issued additional CAA section 114 requests for the Harrison coal-fired plant seeking information and documentation relevant to its operation and maintenance, including capital projects undertaken since 2007.AE intends to comply with the CAA but, at this time, is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



In June 2005, the PA DEP and the Attorneys General of New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland filed suit against AE, AE Supply and the Allegheny Utilities in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania alleging, among other things, that Allegheny performed major modifications in violation of the NSR provisions of the CAA and the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act at the coal-fired Hatfield's Ferry, Armstrong and Mitchell Plants in Pennsylvania.A non-jury trial on liability only was held












in September 2010.On February 6, 2014, the Court entered judgment for AE, AE Supply, and the Allegheny Utilities finding they had not violated the CAA or the Pennsylvania Air Pollution Control Act. This decision does not change the status of these plants which remain deactivated.

In 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit decided that CAIR violated the CAA but allowed CAIR to remain in effect to “temporarily preserve its environmental values” until the EPA replaces CAIR with a new rule consistent with the Court's decision.



In July 2011, the EPA finalized CSAPR, to replace CAIR, requiring reductions of NOx and SO




emissions in



two



phases (2012 and 2014), ultimately capping SO




emissions in affected states to



2.4 million



tons annually and NOx emissions to



1.2 million



tons annually.



CSAPR allows trading of NOx and SO




emission allowances between power plants located in the same state and interstate trading of NOx and SO




emission allowances with some restrictions.



On December 30, 2011, CSAPR was stayed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and was ultimately vacated by the Court on August 21, 2012.



The Court has ordered the EPA to continue administration of CAIR until it finalizes a valid replacement for CAIR.



On January 24, 2013, EPA and intervenors' petitions seeking rehearing or rehearing en banc were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.



On June 24, 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States agreed to review the decision vacating CSAPR and heard oral argument on December 10, 2013.



Depending on the outcome of these proceedings and how any final rules are ultimately implemented, the future cost of compliance may be substantial and changes to FirstEnergy's and FES' operations may result.





Hazardous Air Pollutant Emissions



On December 21, 2011, the EPA finalized the MATS imposing emission limits for mercury, PM, and HCL for all existing and new coal-fired electric generating units effective in April 2015 with averaging of emissions from multiple units located at a single plant.



Under the CAA, state permitting authorities can grant an additional compliance year through April 2016, as needed, including instances when necessary to maintain reliability where electric generating units are being closed.



On December 28, 2012, the WVDEP granted a conditional extension through April 16, 2016 for MATS compliance at the Fort Martin, Harrison and Pleasants stations.



On March 20, 2013, the PA DEP granted an extension through April 16, 2016 for MATS compliance at the Hatfield's Ferry and Bruce Mansfield stations.



In addition, an EPA enforcement policy document contemplates up to an additional year to achieve compliance, through April 2017, under certain circumstances for reliability critical units.



MATS has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit by various entities, including FirstEnergy's challenge of the PM emission limit imposed on petroleum coke boilers, such as Bay Shore Unit 1. Oral arguments were heard on December 10, 2013.



Depending on the outcome of these proceedings and how the MATS are ultimately implemented, FirstEnergy's total cost of compliance with MATS is currently estimated to be approximately



$465 million



(Competitive Energy Services segment of



$240 million



and Regulated Distribution segment of



$225 million

).





As of September 1, 2012, Albright, Armstrong, Bay Shore Units 2-4, Eastlake Units 4-5, R. Paul Smith, Rivesville and Willow Island were deactivated.FG entered into RMR arrangements with PJM for Eastlake Units 1-3, Ashtabula Unit 5 and Lake Shore Unit 18 through the spring of 2015, when they are scheduled to be deactivated. In February 2014, PJM notified FG that Eastlake Units 1-3 and Lake Shore Unit 18 will be released from RMR status as of September 15, 2014.As of October 9, 2013, the Hatfield's Ferry and Mitchell stations were also deactivated.



FirstEnergy and FES have various long-term coal transportation agreements, some of which run through 2025 and certain of which are related to the plants described above.FE and FES have asserted force majeure defenses for delivery shortfalls under certain agreements, and are in discussion with the applicable counterparties.As to two agreements, FE and FES have settled monetary claims for damages for the failure to take minimum quantities for the calendar year 2012 by the payments of approximately$70 million, and agreed to pay liquidated damages for delivery shortfalls for 2013 and 2014.FE and FES recorded $67 million in liquidated damages in the fourth quarter of 2013, associated with estimated 2013 delivery shortfalls, which were paid in the first quarter of 2014.Additionally, in January 2014, FE and FES reached an agreement in principle with Mepco Holdings LLC to terminate a contract for future coal deliveries to Hatfield for $18 million, which was approved by the United States Bankruptcy Court on February 26, 2014.If FE and FES fail to reach a resolution with applicable counterparties for coal transportation agreements associated with the deactivated plants or unresolved aspects of the transportation agreements and it were ultimately determined that, contrary to their belief, the force majeure provisions or other defenses do not excuse delivery shortfalls, the results of operations and financial condition of both FirstEnergy and FES could be materially adversely impacted.














Climate Change



There are a number of initiatives to reduce GHG emissions under consideration at the state, federal and international level.Certain northeastern states are participating in the RGGI and western states led by California, have implemented programs to control emissions of certain GHGs.In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama called for Congressional action on GHG emissions indicating his administration will take action in the event Congress fails to act.In June 2013, the President's Climate Action Plan outlined Executive action to: (1) cut carbon pollution in America, including the EPA carbon pollution standards for both new and existing power plants by17%by 2020 (from 2005 levels); (2) prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change; and (3) lead international efforts to combat global climate change and prepare for its impacts.



In September 2009, the EPA finalized a national GHG emissions collection and reporting rule that required the measurement and reporting of GHG emissions commencing in 2010.



In December 2009, the EPA released its final “Endangerment and Cause or Contribute Findings for Greenhouse Gases under the Clean Air Act.”



The EPA's finding concludes that concentrations of several key GHGs increase the threat of climate change and may be regulated as “air pollutants” under the CAA.



In April 2010, the EPA finalized new GHG standards for model years 2012 to 2016 passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty passenger vehicles and clarified that GHG regulation under the CAA would not be triggered for electric generating plants and other stationary sources until January 2, 2011, at the earliest.



In May 2010, the EPA finalized new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when NSR pre-construction permits would be required including an emissions applicability threshold of



75,000



tons per year of CO




equivalents for existing facilities under the CAA's PSD program.



On April 13, 2012, the EPA proposed new source performance standards for GHG emissions from newly constructed fossil fuel generating units that are larger than






MW, which were ultimately withdrawn.



On June 25, 2013, a Presidential memorandum directed the EPA to complete, in a timely fashion, proposed new source performance standards for GHG emissions from newly constructed fossil fuel generating units, starting with re-proposal by September 20, 2013.



The memorandum further directed the EPA to propose by June 1, 2014 and complete by June 1, 2015, GHG emission standards for existing fossil fuel generating units.



On September 20, 2013, the EPA proposed a new source performance standard of 1,000 lbs. CO


/MWH for large natural gas fired units (> 850 mmBTU/hr), and 1,100 lbs. CO


/MWH for other natural gas fired units (≤ 850 mmBTU/hr), and 1,100 lbs. CO


/MWH for fossil fuel fired units which would require partial carbon capture and storage.



On October 15, 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review a June 2012 D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding the EPA's May 2010 regulations to decide a single narrow question: "Whether EPA permissibly determined that its regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles triggered permitting requirements under the CAA for stationary sources that emit greenhouse gases?"



Oral argument was held on February 24, 2014.



Depending on the outcome of these proceedings and how any final rules are ultimately implemented, the future cost of compliance may be substantial and changes to FirstEnergy's and FES' operations may result.





At the international level, the Kyoto Protocol, signed by the U.S. in 1998 but never submitted for ratification by the U.S. Senate, was intended to address global warming by reducing the amount of man-made GHG, including CO


, emitted by developed countries by 2012.



A December 2009 U.N. Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen did not reach a consensus on a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol, but did take note of the Copenhagen Accord, a non-binding political agreement that recognized the scientific view that the increase in global temperature should be below



two



degrees Celsius; includes a commitment by developed countries to provide funds, approaching



$30 billion



over three years with a goal of increasing to



$100 billion



by 2020; and establishes the “Green Climate Fund” to support mitigation, adaptation, and other climate-related activities in developing countries.



To the extent that they have become a party to the Copenhagen Accord, developed economies, such as the European Union, Japan, Russia and the United States, would commit to quantified economy-wide emissions targets by 2020, while developing countries, including Brazil, China and India, would agree to take mitigation actions, subject to their domestic measurement, reporting and verification.



In December 2010, the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico resulted in an acknowledgment to reduce emissions from industrialized countries by 25 to 40 percent from 1990 emissions by 2020 and support enhanced action on climate change in the developing world.



In December 2011 the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Durban, South Africa, established a negotiating process to develop a new post-2020 climate change protocol, called the “Durban Platform for Enhanced Action”.



This negotiating process contemplates developed countries, as well as developing countries such as China, India, Brazil, and South Africa, to undertake legally binding commitments post-2020.



In addition, certain countries agreed to extend the Kyoto Protocol for a second commitment period, commencing in 2013 and expiring in 2018 or 2020.



In December 2012, the U.N. Climate Change Conference in Doha, Qatar, resulted in countries agreeing to a new commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol beginning in 2020.



The new Doha Amendment to establish a second commitment period requires the ratification of three-quarters of the parties to the Kyoto Protocol before it becomes effective.





FirstEnergy cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies, although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting CO2emissions, or litigation alleging damages from GHG emissions, could require significant capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations.The CO2emissions per KWH of electricity generated by FirstEnergy is lower than many of its regional competitors due to its diversified generation sources, which include low or non-CO2emitting gas-fired and nuclear generators.



Clean Water Act



Various water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal CWA and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy's plants.In addition, the states in which FirstEnergy operates have water quality standards applicable to FirstEnergy's operations.














In 2004, the EPA established new performance standards under Section 316(b) of the CWA for reducing impacts on fish and shellfish from cooling water intake structures at certain existing electric generating plants.



The regulations call for reductions in impingement mortality (when aquatic organisms are pinned against screens or other parts of a cooling water intake system) and entrainment (which occurs when aquatic life is drawn into a facility's cooling water system).



In 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit invalidated portions of the Section 316(b) performance standards and the EPA has taken the position that until further rulemaking occurs, permitting authorities should continue the existing practice of applying their best professional judgment to minimize impacts on fish and shellfish from cooling water intake structures.



In April 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed one significant aspect of the Second Circuit's opinion and decided that Section 316(b) of the CWA authorizes the EPA to compare costs with benefits in determining the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact at cooling water intake structures.



On March 28, 2011, the EPA released a new proposed regulation under Section 316(b) of the CWA to reduce fish impingement to a



12%



annual average and determine site-specific controls, if any, to reduce entrainment of aquatic life following studies to be provided to permitting authorities.



The period for finalizing the Section 316(b) regulation was extended to April 17, 2014 under a Settlement Agreement between EPA and certain NGOs.



FirstEnergy is studying various control options and their costs and effectiveness, including pilot testing of reverse louvers in a portion of the Bay Shore power plant's water intake channel to divert fish away from the plant's water intake system.



Depending on the results of such studies and the EPA's further rulemaking and any final action taken by the states exercising best professional judgment, the future costs of compliance with these standards may require material capital expenditures.





On April 19, 2013, the EPA proposed regulatory changes to the waste water effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating category (40 CFR Part 423).The EPA proposedeighttreatment options for waste water discharges from electric power plants, of which four are "preferred" by the Agency.The preferred options range from more stringent chemical and biological treatment requirements to zero discharge requirements.The EPA is required to finalize this rulemaking by May 22, 2014, under a consent decree entered by a U.S. District Court and the treatment obligations are proposed to phase-in as waste water discharge permits are renewed on a5-year cycle from 2017 to 2022.Depending on the content of the EPA's final rule, the future costs of compliance with these standards may require material capital expenditures.



In October 2009, the WVDEP issued an NPDES water discharge permit for the Fort Martin Plant, which imposes TDS, sulfate concentrations and other effluent limitations for heavy metals, as well as temperature limitations.Concurrent with the issuance of the Fort Martin NPDES permit, WVDEP also issued an administrative order setting deadlines for MP to meet certain of the effluent limits that were effective immediately under the terms of the NPDES permit.MP appealed, and a stay of certain conditions of the NPDES permit and order have been granted pending a final decision on the appeal and subject to WVDEP moving to dissolve the stay.The Fort Martin NPDES permit could require an initial capital investment ranging from$150 millionto$300 millionin order to install technology to meet the TDS and sulfate limits, which technology may also meet certain of the other effluent limits.Additional technology may be needed to meet certain other limits in the Fort Martin NPDES permit.MP intends to vigorously pursue these issues but cannot predict the outcome of these appeals or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



In December 2010, PA DEP submitted its CWA 303(d) list to the EPA with a recommended sulfate impairment designation for an approximately68mile stretch of the Monongahela River north of the West Virginia border.In May 2011, the EPA agreed with PA DEP's recommended sulfate impairment designation which requires the development of a TMDL limit for the river, a process that will take PA DEP approximately five years.Based on the stringency of the TMDL, MP may incur significant costs to reduce sulfate discharges into the Monongahela River if the NPDES permit for the coal-fired Fort Martin plant in West Virginia is required to be modified or renewed to include more stringent effluent limitations for sulfate.However, the Hatfield's Ferry and Mitchell Plants in Pennsylvania that discharge into the Monongahela River were deactivated on October 9, 2013.



FirstEnergy intends to vigorously defend against the CWA matters described above but, except as indicated above, cannot predict their outcomes or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



Regulation of Waste Disposal



Federal and state hazardous waste regulations have been promulgated as a result of the RCRA of 1976, as amended, and the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976.Certain fossil-fuel combustion residuals, such as coal ash, were exempted from hazardous waste disposal requirements pending the EPA's evaluation of the need for future regulation.



In December 2009, in an advance notice of public rulemaking, the EPA asserted that the large volumes of coal combustion residuals produced by electric utilities pose significant financial risk to the industry.In May 2010, the EPA proposedtwooptions for additional regulation of coal combustion residuals, including the option of regulation as a special waste under the EPA's hazardous waste management program which could have a significant impact on the management, beneficial use and disposal of coal combustion residuals.On April 19, 2013, the EPA stated it would "align" its proposed coal combustion residuals regulations with revised waste water discharge effluent limitations guidelines and standards for the Steam Electric Power Generating category (40 CFR Part 423) that were proposed on that date.On July 25, 2013, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 221 that would require CCRs to be regulated under Subtitle D of RCRA, as non-hazardous.On January 29, 2014, EPA agreed to take final action by December 19, 2014 on whether or not to pursue the proposed non-hazardous waste option for regulating CCRs in a Consent Decree to be filed in pending litigation. Depending on the content of the EPA's final effluent limitations rule, the specifics of any "alignment", whether EPA chooses to pursue the non-hazardous or hazardous waste option and the enactment of legislation, the future costs of compliance with such standards may require material capital expenditures.














On July 27, 2012, the PA DEP filed a complaint against FG in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania with claims under the RCRA and Pennsylvania's Solid Waste Management Act regarding the LBR CCB Impoundment and simultaneously proposed a Consent Decree between PA DEP and FG to resolve those claims.



On December 14, 2012, a modified Consent Decree that addresses public comments received by PA DEP was entered by the court, requiring FG to conduct monitoring studies and submit a closure plan to the PA DEP, no later than March 31, 2013, and discontinue disposal to LBR as currently permitted by December 31, 2016.



The modified Consent Decree also requires payment of civil penalties of



$800,000



to resolve claims under the Solid Waste Management Act.



On February 1, 2013, FG submitted a Feasibility Study analyzing various technical issues relevant to the closure of LBR.



On March 28, 2013, FG submitted to the PA DEP a Closure Plan Major Permit Modification Application which provides for placing a final cap over LBR that would require






years to fully implement following the closure of LBR.



The estimated cost for the proposed closure plan is



$234 million

, including environmental and other post closure costs.



On October 3, 2013, the PA DEP issued a technical deficiency letter citing four main deficiencies with the Closure Plan: (1) seeking to accelerate the 15 year period proposed by FG for closure activities to complete closure in 9 years by commencing closure activities prior to 2017 as proposed by FG; (2) seeking to extend bond closure and post closure activities beyond the 45 years proposed by FG; (3) seeking active dewatering of the CCBs in areas where there are seeps impacted by the Impoundment; and (4) seeking an abatement plan for groundwater impacted by arsenic.



FG responded to the PA DEP on December 3, 2013, and as a result of the Closure Plan, FG increased its asset retirement obligation for LBR by $163 million in 2013.



The Bruce Mansfield Plant is pursuing several options for its CCBs following December 31, 2016, and on January 23, 2013, announced a plan for beneficial use of its CCBs for mine reclamation in LaBelle, Pennsylvania.



In June 2013, a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, alleges the LaBelle site is in violation of RCRA and state laws.



In addition, on December 20, 2012, the Environmental Integrity Project and others served FG with a citizen suit notice alleging CWA and PA Clean Streams Law Violations at LBR.





On October 10, 2013 and December 5, 2013, complaints were filed on behalf of approximately50individuals against FE, FG and FES in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of West Virginia and approximately 15 individuals against FG in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania seeking damages for alleged property damage, bodily injury and emotional distress related to the LBR CCB Impoundment.The complaints state claims for private nuisance, negligence, negligence per se, reckless conduct and trespass related to alleged groundwater contamination and odors emanating from the Impoundment.FE, FG and FES believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend themselves against the allegations made in the complaints, but, at this time, are unable to predict the outcome of the above matter or estimate the possible loss or range of loss.



FirstEnergy's future cost of compliance with any coal combustion residuals regulations that may be promulgated could be substantial and would depend, in part, on the regulatory action taken by the EPA and implementation by the EPA or the states.Compliance with those regulations could have an adverse impact on FirstEnergy's results of operations and financial condition.



Certain of FirstEnergy's utilities have been named as potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites, which may require cleanup under the CERCLA.Allegations of disposal of hazardous substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides that all potentially responsible parties for a particular site may be liable on a joint and several basis.Environmental liabilities that are considered probable have been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as ofDecember 31, 2013based on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, FE's and its subsidiaries' proportionate responsibility for such costs and the financial ability of other unaffiliated entities to pay.Total liabilities of approximately$128 millionhave been accrued throughDecember 31, 2013.Included in the total are accrued liabilities of approximately$82 millionfor environmental remediation of former manufactured gas plants and gas holder facilities in New Jersey, which are being recovered by JCP&L through a non-bypassable SBC.FirstEnergy or its subsidiaries could be found potentially responsible for additional amounts or additional sites, but the possible losses or range of losses cannot be determined or reasonably estimated at this time.



Fuel Supply



FirstEnergy currently has long-term coal contracts with various terms to acquire approximately27.8 milliontons of coal for the year2014which is approximately100%of its estimated2014coal requirements. This contract coal is produced primarily from mines located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Montana and Wyoming. The contracts expire at various times throughDecember 31, 2030. See “Environmental Matters" for factors pertaining to meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired generating units.



FirstEnergy has contracts for all uranium requirements through2016and a portion of uranium material requirements through2024. Conversion services contracts fully cover requirements through2015and partially fill requirements through2024. Enrichment services are contracted for essentially all of the enrichment requirements for nuclear fuel through2020. A portion of enrichment requirements is also contracted for through2024. Fabrication services for fuel assemblies are contracted for both Beaver Valley units through2020and Davis-Besse through2025and through the current operating license period for Perry. In addition to the existing commitments, FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for the supply of uranium and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal services.



On-site spent fuel storage facilities are currently adequate for all FENOC operating units. Plant modifications are underway at Beaver Valley to establish a dry cask storage facility that, once completed, will extend spent fuel storage capacity through the end of current operating licenses at Beaver Valley Unit 1 (2036) and Beaver Valley Unity 2 (2047). Davis-Besse is planning to resume dry cask storage operations in2017which will extend on-site spent fuel storage capacity through2037(end of current operating license plus a 20-year operating license extension). Perry completed plant modification for dry cask storage in2012and has planned










to conduct dry cask storage loading campaigns that will provide for sufficient spent fuel storage capacity through2046(end of current operating license plus a 20-year operating license extension).



The Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provided for the construction of facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear wastes, including spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric utilities. NG has contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley, Davis-Besse and Perry. Yucca Mountain was approved in 2002 as a repository for underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants and high level waste from U.S. defense programs. Recent administrative and federal court proceedings render the completion of Yucca Mountain uncertain. The current Administration has stated the Yucca Mountain repository will not be completed. In light of this uncertainty, FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for storage capacity as a contingency for the continuing delays of the DOE acceptance of spent fuel for disposal.



In November, 2013, the DOE was ordered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to submit a proposal to Congress to eliminate the ongoing 1 mill per KWH fee utilities pay for nuclear waste disposal. The ruling was based upon the DOE's failure to establish a court ordered assessment to validate the appropriateness of the fee in the wake of the cancellation of the Yucca Mountain repository. On January 3, 2014, DOE made the ordered submission to Congress. On that same day the government also filed a motion with the court for reconsideration en banc. If no legislative or further judicial action is taken to allow for continued collection of these fees under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, they may be terminated.



Fuel oil and natural gas are used primarily to fuel peaking units and/or to ignite the burners prior to burning coal when a coal-fired plant is restarted. Fuel oil requirements have historically been low and are forecasted to remain so. Requirements are expected to average approximately5 milliongallons per year over the next five years. Natural gas demand at the combined cycle and peaking units is forecasted at approximately27 millionmcf in2014.



System Demand

The2013maximum hourly demand for each of the Utilities was:

•OE—5,743MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•Penn—944MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•CEI—4,286MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•TE—2,168MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•JCP&L—6,353MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•ME—3,009MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•PN—3,039MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•MP—1,943MW onJuly 18, 2013;

•PE—2,820MW onJuly 18, 2013; and

•WP—3,914MW onJuly 18, 2013.



Supply Plan



Regulated Commodity Sourcing



Certain of the Utilities have default service obligations to provide power to non-shopping customers who have elected to continue to receive service under regulated retail tariffs. The volume of these sales can vary depending on the level of shopping that occurs. Supply plans vary by state and by service territory. JCP&L’s default service or BGS supply is secured through a statewide competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. Default service for the Ohio Companies, Pennsylvania Companies and PE's Maryland jurisdiction are provided through a competitive procurement process approved by the PUCO (under the ESP), PPUC (under the DSP) and MDPSC (under the SOS), respectively. If any supplier fails to deliver power to any one of those Utilities’ service areas, the Utility serving that area may need to procure the required power in the market in their role as a LSE. West Virginia electric generation continues to be regulated by the WVPSC.



Unregulated Commodity Sourcing



The Competitive Energy Services segment, through FES and AE Supply, provides energy and energy related services, including the generation and sale of electricity and energy planning and procurement through retail and wholesale competitive supply arrangements. FES and AE Supply provide the power requirements of their competitive load-serving obligations through a combination of subsidiary-owned generation, non-affiliated contracts and spot market transactions.












FES and AE Supply have retail and wholesale competitive load-serving obligations in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey, serving both affiliated and non-affiliated companies. FES and AE Supply provide energy products and services to customers under various POLR, shopping, competitive-bid and non-affiliated contractual obligations. Geographically, most of FES’ and AE Supply's obligations are in the PJM market area where all of their respective generation facilities are located.



Regional Reliability



All of FirstEnergy's facilities are located within PJM and operate under the reliability oversight of a regional entity known as RFC. This regional entity operates under the oversight of the NERC in accordance with a Delegation Agreement approved by FERC. RFC began operations under the NERC on January 1, 2006. On July 20, 2006, the NERC was certified by FERC as the ERO in the United States pursuant to Section 215 of the FPA and RFC was certified as a regional entity.



Competition



As a result of actions taken by state legislative bodies over the past several years, major changes in the electric utility business have occurred in portions of the United States, including Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland, where most of FirstEnergy utility subsidiaries operate. These changes have altered the way traditional integrated utilities conduct their business. FirstEnergy has aligned its business units to participate in the competitive electricity marketplace (see Management's Discussion and Analysis for more information regarding FirstEnergy's Competitive Energy Services segment).



FirstEnergy's Competitive Energy Services segment participates in deregulated energy markets in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey and Illinois, through FES and AE Supply. In these markets, the Competitive Energy Services segment competes: (1) to provide retail generation service directly to end users; (2) to provide wholesale generation service to utilities, municipalities and co-operatives, which, in turn, resell to end users; and (3) in the wholesale market.



Seasonality



The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business and weather patterns can have a material impact on FirstEnergy’s operating results. Demand for electricity in our service territories historically peaks during the summer and winter months, with market prices also generally peaking at those times. Accordingly, FirstEnergy’s annual results of operations and liquidity position may depend disproportionately on its operating performance during the summer and winter. Mild weather conditions may result in lower power sales and consequently lower earnings.



Research and Development



The Utilities, FES, FG, FENOC and ATSI participate in the funding of EPRI, which was formed for the purpose of expanding electric R&D under the voluntary sponsorship of the nation’s electric utility industry — public, private and cooperative. Its goal is to mutually benefit utilities and their customers by promoting the development of new and improved technologies to help the utility industry meet present and future electric energy needs in environmentally and economically acceptable ways. EPRI conducts research on all aspects of electric power production and use, including fuels, generation, delivery, energy management and conservation, environmental effects and energy analysis. The majority of EPRI’s R&D programs and projects are directed toward business solutions and their applications to problems facing the electric utility industry.



FirstEnergy participates in other initiatives with industry R&D consortiums and universities to address technology needs for its various business units. Participation in these consortiums helps the company address research needs in areas such as plant operations and maintenance, major component reliability, environmental controls, advanced energy technologies, and transmission and distribution system infrastructure to improve performance, and develop new technologies for advanced energy and grid applications.
