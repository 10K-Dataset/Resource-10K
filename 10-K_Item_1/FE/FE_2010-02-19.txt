FES was
organized under the laws of the State of Ohio in 1997. FES provides
energy-related products and services to wholesale and retail customers in the
MISO and PJM markets. FES also owns and operates, through its subsidiary, FGCO,
FirstEnergy’s fossil and hydroelectric generating facilities and owns, through
its subsidiary, NGC, FirstEnergy’s nuclear generating facilities. FENOC, a
separate subsidiary of FirstEnergy, organized under the laws of the State of
Ohio in 1998, operates and maintains NGC’s nuclear generating facilities. FES
purchases the entire output of the generation facilities owned by FGCO and NGC,
as well as the output relating to leasehold interests of the Ohio Companies in
certain of those facilities that are subject to sale and leaseback arrangements
with non-affiliates, pursuant to full output, cost-of-service PSAs.



FirstEnergy’s
generating portfolio includes 13,970 MW of diversified capacity (FES –
13,770 MW and JCP&L – 200 MW). Within FES’ portfolio, approximately
7,469 MW, or 54.2%, consists of coal-fired capacity; 3,991 MW, or 29.0%,
consists of nuclear capacity; 1,599 MW, or 11.6%, consists of oil and natural
gas peaking units; 451 MW, or 3.3%, consists of hydroelectric capacity; and 260
MW, or 1.9%, consists of capacity from FGCO’s current 11.5% entitlement to the
generation output owned by the OVEC. FirstEnergy’s nuclear and non-nuclear
facilities are operated by FENOC and FGCO, respectively, and, except for
portions of certain facilities that are subject to the sale and leaseback
arrangements with non-affiliates referred to above for which the corresponding
output is available to FES through power sale agreements, are all owned directly
by NGC and FGCO, respectively. The FES generating assets are concentrated
primarily in Ohio, plus the bordering regions of Pennsylvania and Michigan. All
FES units are dedicated to MISO except the Beaver Valley Power Station, which is

Utility
Regulation



State
Regulation



Each of
the Utilities’ retail rates, conditions of service, issuance of securities and
other matters are subject to regulation in the state in which each company
operates – in Ohio by the PUCO, in New Jersey by the NJBPU and in Pennsylvania
by the PPUC. In addition, under Ohio law, municipalities may regulate rates of a
public utility, subject to appeal to the PUCO if not acceptable to the
utility.



As a
competitive retail electric supplier serving retail customers in Ohio,
Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland, Michigan, and Illinois, FES is subject to
state laws applicable to competitive electric suppliers in those states,
including affiliate codes of conduct that apply to FES and its public utility
affiliates. In addition, if FES or any of its subsidiaries were to engage in the
construction of significant new generation facilities, they would also be
subject to state siting authority.






Federal
Regulation



With
respect to their wholesale and interstate electric operations and rates, the
Utilities, ATSI, FES, FGCO and NGC are subject to regulation by the FERC. Under
the FPA, the FERC regulates rates for interstate sales at wholesale,
transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters, including
construction and operation of hydroelectric projects. The FERC regulations
require ATSI, Met-Ed, JCP&L and Penelec to provide open access transmission
service at FERC-approved rates, terms and conditions. Transmission service over
ATSI’s facilities is provided by MISO under its open access transmission tariff,
and transmission service over Met-Ed’s, JCP&L’s and Penelec’s facilities is
provided by PJM under its open access transmission tariff. The FERC also
regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers. Additionally, see
FERC Matters for RTO Consolidation.



The FERC
regulates the sale of power for resale in interstate commerce by granting
authority to public utilities to sell wholesale power at market-based rates upon
a showing that the seller cannot exert market power in generation or
transmission. FES, FGCO and NGC have been authorized by the FERC to sell
wholesale power in interstate commerce and have a market-based tariff on file
with the FERC. By virtue of this tariff and authority to sell wholesale power,
each company is regulated as a public utility under the FPA. However, consistent
with its historical practice, the FERC has granted FES, FGCO and NGC a waiver
from most of the reporting, record-keeping and accounting requirements that
typically apply to traditional public utilities. Along with market-based rate
authority, the FERC also granted FES, FGCO and NGC blanket authority to issue
securities and assume liabilities under Section 204 of the FPA. As a condition
to selling electricity on a wholesale basis at market-based rates, FES, FGCO and
NGC, like all other entities granted market-based rate authority, must file
electronic quarterly reports with the FERC, listing its sales transactions for
the prior quarter.



The
nuclear generating facilities owned and leased by NGC are subject to extensive
regulation by the NRC. The NRC subjects nuclear generating stations to
continuing review and regulation covering, among other things, operations,
maintenance, emergency planning, security and environmental and radiological
aspects of those stations. The NRC may modify, suspend or revoke operating
licenses and impose civil penalties for failure to comply with the Atomic Energy
Act, the regulations under such Act or the terms of the licenses. FENOC is the
licensee for these plants and has direct compliance responsibility for NRC
matters. FES controls the economic dispatch of NGC’s plants. See Nuclear
Regulation below.



Regulatory
Accounting



The
Utilities and ATSI recognize, as regulatory assets, costs which the FERC, PUCO,
PPUC and NJBPU have authorized for recovery from customers in future periods or
for which authorization is probable. Without the probability of such
authorization, costs currently recorded as regulatory assets would have been
charged to income as incurred. All regulatory assets are expected to be
recovered from customers under the Utilities' respective transition and
regulatory plans. Based on those plans, the Utilities continue to bill and
collect cost-based rates for their transmission and distribution services, which
remain regulated; accordingly, it is appropriate that the Utilities continue the
application of regulatory accounting to those operations.



FirstEnergy
accounts for the effects of regulation through the application of regulatory
accounting to its operating utilities since their rates:



·are
      established by a third-party regulator with the authority to set rates
      that bind customers;



·are
      cost-based; and



·can
      be charged to and collected from
customers.



An
enterprise meeting all of these criteria capitalizes costs that would otherwise
be charged to expense (regulatory assets) if the rate actions of its regulator
make it probable that those costs will be recovered in future revenue.
Regulatory accounting is applied only to the parts of the business that meet the
above criteria. If a portion of the business applying regulatory accounting no
longer meets those requirements, previously recorded net regulatory assets are
removed from the balance sheet in accordance with GAAP.



In Ohio,
New Jersey and Pennsylvania, laws applicable to electric industry restructuring
contain similar provisions that are reflected in the Utilities' respective state
regulatory plans. These provisions include:



·restructuring
      the electric generation business and allowing the Utilities' customers to
      select a competitive electric generation supplier other than the
      Utilities;



·establishing
      or defining the PLR obligations to customers in the Utilities' service
      areas;



·providing
      the Utilities with the opportunity to recover potentially stranded
      investment (or transition costs) not otherwise recoverable in a
      competitive generation market;






·itemizing
      (unbundling) the price of electricity into its component elements –
      including generation, transmission, distribution and stranded costs
      recovery charges;



·continuing
      regulation of the Utilities' transmission and distribution systems;
      and



·requiring
      corporate separation of regulated and unregulated business
      activities.



Reliability
Initiatives



In 2005,
Congress amended the FPA to provide for federally-enforceable mandatory
reliability standards. The mandatory reliability standards apply to the bulk
power system and impose certain operating, record-keeping and reporting
requirements on the Utilities and ATSI. The NERC is charged with establishing
and enforcing these reliability standards, although it has delegated day-to-day
implementation and enforcement of its responsibilities to eight regional
entities, including ReliabilityFirst Corporation. All of FirstEnergy’s
facilities are located within the ReliabilityFirst region. FirstEnergy actively
participates in the NERC and ReliabilityFirst stakeholder processes, and
otherwise monitors and manages its companies in response to the ongoing
development, implementation and enforcement of the reliability
standards.



FirstEnergy
believes that it is in compliance with all currently-effective and enforceable
reliability standards. Nevertheless, it is clear that the NERC, ReliabilityFirst
and the FERC will continue to refine existing reliability standards as well as
to develop and adopt new reliability standards. The financial impact of
complying with new or amended standards cannot be determined at this time.
However, the 2005 amendments to the FPA provide that all prudent costs incurred
to comply with the new reliability standards be recovered in rates. Still, any
future inability on FirstEnergy’s part to comply with the reliability standards
for its bulk power system could result in the imposition of financial penalties
that could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.



In April
2007, ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit of FirstEnergy’s
bulk-power system within the Midwest ISO region and found it to be in full
compliance with all audited reliability standards. Similarly, in October 2008,
ReliabilityFirst performed a routine compliance audit of FirstEnergy’s
bulk-power system within the PJM region and found it to be in full compliance
with all audited reliability standards. Our MISO facilities are next due for the
periodic audit by ReliabilityFirstlater this
year.



On
December 9, 2008, a transformer at JCP&L’s Oceanview substation failed,
resulting in an outage on certain bulk electric system (transmission voltage)
lines out of the Oceanview and Atlantic substations, with customers in the
affected area losing power. Power was restored to most customers within a few
hours and to all customers within eleven hours. On December 16, 2008,
JCP&L provided preliminary information about the event to certain regulatory
agencies, including the NERC. On March 31, 2009, the NERC initiated a Compliance
Violation Investigation in order to determine JCP&L’s contribution to the
electrical event and to review any potential violation of NERC Reliability
Standards associated with the event. The initial phase of the investigation
required JCP&L to respond to the NERC’s request for factual data about the
outage. JCP&L submitted its written response on May 1, 2009. The NERC
conducted on site interviews with personnel involved in responding to the event
on June 16-17, 2009. On July 7, 2009, the NERC issued additional questions
regarding the event and JCP&L replied as requested on August 6, 2009.
JCP&L is not able at this time to predict what actions, if any, that the
NERC may take based on the data submittals or interview results.



On June
5, 2009, FirstEnergy self-reported to ReliabilityFirsta potential violation
of NERC Standard PRC-005 resulting from its inability to validate maintenance
records for 20 protection system relays (out of approximately 20,000 reportable
relays) in JCP&L’s and Penelec’s transmission systems. These potential
violations were discovered during a comprehensive field review of all
FirstEnergy substations to verify equipment and maintenance database accuracy.
FirstEnergy has completed all mitigation actions, including calibrations and
maintenance records for the relays. ReliabilityFirstissued an Initial
Notice of Alleged Violation on June 22, 2009. The NERC approved FirstEnergy’s
mitigation plan on August 19, 2009, and submitted it to the FERC for approval on
August 19, 2009. FirstEnergy is not able at this time to predict what actions or
penalties, if any, that ReliabilityFirstwill propose for this
self-reported violation.



Ohio
Regulatory Matters



On June
7, 2007, the Ohio Companies filed an application for an increase in electric
distribution rates with the PUCO and, on August 6, 2007, updated their
filing. On January 21, 2009, the PUCO granted the Ohio Companies’
application in part to increase electric distribution rates by
$136.6 million (OE - $68.9 million, CEI - $29.2 million and TE -
$38.5 million). These increases went into effect for OE and TE on
January 23, 2009, and for CEI on May 1, 2009. Applications for rehearing of
this order were filed by the Ohio Companies and one other party on February 20,
2009. The PUCO granted these applications for rehearing on March 18, 2009
for the purpose of further consideration. The PUCO has not yet issued a
substantive Entry on Rehearing.










The CBP
auction occurred on May 13-14, 2009, and resulted in a weighted average
wholesale price for generation and transmission of 6.15 cents per KWH. The bid
was for a single, two-year product for the service period from June 1, 2009
through May 31, 2011. FES participated in the auction, winning 51% of the
tranches (one tranche equals one percent of the load supply). Subsequent to the
signing of the wholesale contracts, four winning bidders reached separate
agreements with FES with the result that FES is now responsible for providing
77% of the Ohio Companies’ total load supply.  The results of the CBP
were accepted by the PUCO on May 14, 2009. FES has also separately
contracted with numerous communities to provide retail generation service
through governmental aggregation programs.



On July
27, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed applications with the PUCO to recover three
different categories of deferred distribution costs on an accelerated basis. In
the Ohio Companies' Amended ESP, the PUCO approved the recovery of these
deferrals, with collection originally set to begin in January 2011 and to
continue over a 5 or 25 year period. The principal amount plus carrying charges
through August 31, 2009 for these deferrals totaled $305.1 million.
The applications were approved by the PUCO on August 19, 2009. Recovery of this
amount, together with carrying charges calculated as approved in the Amended
ESP, commenced on September 1, 2009, and will be collected in the 18 non-summer
months from September 2009 through May 2011, subject to reconciliation until
fully collected, with $165 million of the above amount being recovered from
residential customers, and $140.1 million being recovered from
non-residential customers.








In
October 2009, the PUCO issued additional Entries, modifying certain of its
previous rules that set out the manner in which electric utilities, including
the Ohio Companies, will be required to comply with benchmarks contained in
SB221 related to the employment of alternative energy resources, energy
efficiency/peak demand reduction programs as well as greenhouse gas reporting
requirements and changes to long term forecast reporting requirements.
Applications for rehearing filed in mid-November 2009 were granted on December
9, 2009 for the sole purpose of further consideration of the matters raised in
those applications.  The PUCO has not yet issued a substantive Entry
on Rehearing.  The rules implementing the requirements of SB221 went
into effect on December 10, 2009. The Ohio Companies, on October 27, 2009,
submitted an application to amend their 2009 statutory energy efficiency
benchmarks to zero. On January 7, 2010, the PUCO issued an Order granting the
Companies’ request to amend the energy efficiency benchmarks.



Additionally
under SB221, electric utilities and electric service companies are required to
serve part of their load from renewable energy resources equivalent to 0.25% of
the KWH they serve in 2009.  In August and October 2009, the Ohio
Companies conducted RFPs to secure RECs. The RFPs sought renewable energy RECs,
including solar RECs and RECs generated in Ohio in order to meet the Ohio
Companies’ alternative energy requirements set forth in SB221. The RECs acquired
through these two RFPs will be used to help meet the renewable energy
requirements established under SB221 for 2009, 2010 and 2011.  On
December 7, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an application with the PUCO seeking
a force majeure determination regarding the Ohio Companies’ compliance with the
2009 solar energy resources benchmark, and seeking a reduction in the
benchmark.  The PUCO has not yet ruled on that
application.



On
October 20, 2009, the Ohio Companies filed an MRO to procure electric generation
service for the period beginning June 1, 2011. The proposed MRO would
establish a CBP to secure generation supply for customers who do not shop with
an alternative supplier and would be similar, in all material respects, to the
CBP conducted in May 2009 in that it would procure energy, capacity and certain
transmission services on a slice of system basis. Enhancements to the May 2009
CBP, the MRO would include multiple bidding sessions and multiple products with
different delivery periods for generation supply features which are designed to
reduce potential price volatility and reduce supplier risk and encourage bidder
participation. A technical conference was held on October 29, 2009. Hearings
took place in December and the matter has been fully briefed. Pursuant to SB221,
the PUCO has 90 days from the date of the application to determine whether the
MRO meets certain statutory requirements. Although the Ohio Companies requested
a PUCO determination by January 18, 2010, on February 3, 2010, the PUCO
announced that its determination would be delayed. Under a determination that
such statutory requirements are met, the Ohio Companies would be able to
implement the MRO and conduct the CBP.



Pennsylvania
Regulatory Matters



Met-Ed
and Penelec purchase a portion of their PLR and default service requirements
from FES through a fixed-price partial requirements wholesale power sales
agreement. The agreement allows Met-Ed and Penelec to sell the output of NUG
energy to the market and requires FES to provide energy at fixed prices to
replace any NUG energy sold to the extent needed for Met-Ed and Penelec to
satisfy their PLR and default service obligations.



On
February 20, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec filed with the PPUC a generation
procurement plan covering the period January 1, 2011 through May 31,
2013. The plan is designed to provide adequate and reliable service via a
prudent mix of long-term, short-term and spot market generation supply, as
required by Act 129. The plan proposed a staggered procurement schedule,
which varies by customer class, through the use of a descending clock auction.
On August 12, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec filed a settlement agreement with the
PPUC for the generation procurement plan covering the period January 1, 2011,
through May 31, 2013, reflecting the settlement on all but two issues. The
settlement plan is designed to provide adequate and reliable service as required
by Pennsylvania law through a prudent mix of long-term, short-term and
spot-market generation supply as required by Act 129. The settlement plan
proposes a staggered procurement schedule, which varies by customer class. On
September 2, 2009, the ALJ issued a Recommended Decision (RD) approving the
settlement and adopted Met-Ed and Penelec’s positions on two reserved issues. On
November 6, 2009, the PPUC entered an Order approving the settlement and finding
in favor of Met-Ed and Penelec on the two reserved issues.  Generation
procurement began in January 2010.










On May
28, 2009, the PPUC approved Met-Ed’s and Penelec’s annual updates to their TSC
rider for the period June 1, 2009 through May 31, 2010, subject to the
outcome of the proceeding related to the 2008 TSC filing described above. For
Penelec’s customers the new TSC resulted in an approximate 1% decrease in
monthly bills, reflecting projected PJM transmission costs as well as a
reconciliation for costs already incurred. The TSC for Met-Ed’s customers
increased to recover the additional PJM charges paid by Met-Ed in the previous
year and to reflect updated projected costs. In order to gradually transition
customers to the higher rate, the PPUC approved Met-Ed’s proposal to continue to
recover the prior period deferrals allowed in the PPUC’s May 2008 Order and
defer $57.5 million of projected costs to a future TSC to be fully recovered by
December 31, 2010. Under this proposal, monthly bills for Met-Ed’s
customers would increase approximately 9.4% for the period June 2009 through May
2010.



Act 129
became effective in 2008 and addresses issues such as: energy efficiency and
peak load reduction; generation procurement; time-of-use rates; smart meters;
and alternative energy. Among other things Act 129 requires each Pennsylvania
utility to file with the PPUC an energy efficiency and peak load reduction plan
by July 1, 2009, setting forth the utilities’ plans to reduce energy
consumption by a minimum of 1% and 3% by May 31, 2011 and May 31, 2013,
respectively, and to reduce peak demand by a minimum of 4.5% by May 31,
2013. On July 1, 2009, Met-Ed, Penelec, and Penn filed EE&C Plans with
the PPUC in accordance with Act 129. The Pennsylvania Companies submitted a
supplemental filing on July 31, 2009, to revise the Total Resource Cost test
items in the EE&C Plans pursuant to the PPUC’s June 23, 2009 Order.
Following an evidentiary hearing and briefing, the Pennsylvania Companies filed
revised EE&C Plans on September 21, 2009. In an October 28, 2009 Order,
the PPUC approved in part, and rejected in part, the Pennsylvania Companies'
filing. Following additional filings related to the plans, including
modifications as requested by the PPUC. The PPUC issued an order on January 28,
2010, approving, in part, and rejecting, in part the Pennsylvania Companies’
modified plans.  The Pennsylvania Companies filed final plans and
tariff revisions on February 5, 2010 consistent with the minor revisions
required by the PPUC.  The PPUC must approve or reject the plans
within 60 days.










Legislation
addressing rate mitigation and the expiration of rate caps has been introduced
in both the 2008 and 2009 legislative sessions. The final form of such
legislation and its possible impact on the Pennsylvania Companies’ business and
operations are uncertain.



On
February 26, 2009, the PPUC approved a Voluntary Prepayment Plan requested by
Met-Ed and Penelec that provides an opportunity for residential and small
commercial customers to prepay an amount on their monthly electric bills during
2009 and 2010. Customer prepayments earn interest at 7.5% and will be used to
reduce electricity charges in 2011 and 2012.



On March
31, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec submitted their 5-year NUG Statement Compliance
filing to the PPUC in accordance with their 1998 Restructuring Settlement
originally entered into with the PPUC pursuant to comprehensive electric utility
industry restructuring legislation (Customer Choice Act)  adopted in
Pennsylvania in 1996.  In the compliance filing, Met-Ed proposed to
reduce its CTC rate for the residential class with a corresponding increase in
the generation rate and the shopping credit, and Penelec proposed to reduce its
CTC rate to zero for all classes with a corresponding increase in the generation
rate and the shopping credit. While these changes would result in additional
annual generation revenue (Met-Ed - $27 million and Penelec -
$59 million), overall rates would remain unchanged. On July 30, 2009,
the PPUC entered an order approving the 5-year NUG Statement, approving the
reduction of the CTC, and directing Met-Ed and Penelec to file a tariff
supplement implementing this change. On July 31, 2009, Met-Ed and Penelec
filed tariff supplements decreasing the CTC rate in compliance with the
July 30, 2009 order, and increasing the generation rate in compliance with
the companies’ Restructuring Orders of 1998. On August 14, 2009, the PPUC
approved Met-Ed and Penelec’s compliance filings.



By
Tentative Order entered September 17, 2009, the PPUC provided for an
additional 30-day comment period on whether “the Restructuring Settlement allows
NUG over-collection for select and isolated months to be used to reduce non-NUG
stranded costs when a cumulative NUG stranded cost balance
exists.”   In response to the Tentative Order, the Office of
Small Business Advocate, Office of Consumer Advocate, York County Solid Waste
and Refuse Authority, ARIPPA, the Met-Ed Industrial Users Group and Penelec
Industrial Customer Alliance filed comments objecting to the above accounting
method utilized by Met-Ed and Penelec. Met-Ed and Penelec filed reply comments
on October 26, 2009. On November 5, 2009, the PPUC issued a Secretarial
Letter allowing parties to file reply comments to Met-Ed and Penelec’s reply
comments by November 16, 2009, and reply comments were filed by the Office of
Consumer Advocate, ARIPPA, and the Met-Ed Industrial Users Group and Penelec
Industrial Customer Alliance.  Met-Ed and Penelec are awaiting further
action by the Commission.



On
February 8, 2010, Penn filed with the PPUC a generation procurement plan
covering the period June 1, 2011 through May 31, 2013. The plan is designed
to provide adequate and reliable service through a prudent mix of long-term,
short-term and spot market generation supply, as required by Act 129. The
plan proposed a staggered procurement schedule, which varies by customer class,
through the use of a descending clock auction. The PPUC is required to issue an
order on the plan no later than November 8, 2010.

JCP&L
is permitted to defer for future collection from customers the amounts by which
its costs of supplying BGS to non-shopping customers, costs incurred under NUG
agreements, and certain other stranded costs, exceed amounts collected through
BGS and NUGC rates and market sales of NUG energy and capacity. As of December
30, 2009, the accumulated deferred cost balance totaled approximately $98
million.



In
accordance with an April 28, 2004 NJBPU order, JCP&L filed testimony on
June 7, 2004, supporting continuation of the current level and duration of
the funding of TMI-2 decommissioning costs by New Jersey customers without a
reduction, termination or capping of the funding. TMI-2 is a retired nuclear
facility owned by JCP&L. On September 30, 2004, JCP&L filed an
updated TMI-2 decommissioning study. This study resulted in an updated total
decommissioning cost estimate of $729 million (in 2003 dollars) compared to
the estimated $528 million (in 2003 dollars) from the prior 1995
decommissioning study. The DPA filed comments on February 28, 2005
requesting that decommissioning funding be suspended. On March 18, 2005,
JCP&L filed a response to those comments. JCP&L responded to additional
NJBPU staff discovery requests in May and November 2007 and also submitted
comments in the proceeding in November 2007. A schedule for further NJBPU
proceedings has not yet been set. On March 13, 2009, JCP&L filed its
annual SBC Petition with the NJBPU that includes a request for a reduction in
the level of recovery of TMI-2 decommissioning costs based on an updated TMI-2
decommissioning cost analysis dated January 2009. This matter is currently
pending before the NJBPU.



New
Jersey statutes require that the state periodically undertake a planning
process, known as the EMP, to address energy related issues including energy
security, economic growth, and environmental impact. The EMP is to be developed
with involvement of the Governor’s Office and the Governor’s Office of Economic
Growth, and is to be prepared by a Master Plan Committee, which is chaired by
the NJBPU President and includes representatives of several State departments.
The EMP was issued on October 22, 2008, establishing five major
goals:








·maximize
      energy efficiency to achieve a 20% reduction in energy consumption by
      2020;



·reduce
      peak demand for electricity by 5,700 MW by
2020;



·meet
      30% of the state’s electricity needs with renewable energy by
      2020;



·examine
      smart grid technology and develop additional cogeneration and other
      generation resources consistent with the state’s greenhouse gas targets;
      and



·invest
      in innovative clean energy technologies and businesses to stimulate the
      industry’s growth in New Jersey.



On
January 28, 2009, the NJBPU adopted an order establishing the general process
and contents of specific EMP plans that must be filed by New Jersey electric and
gas utilities in order to achieve the goals of the EMP. Such utility specific
plans are due to be filed with the NJBPU by July 1, 2010. At this time,
FirstEnergy and JCP&L cannot determine the impact, if any, the EMP may have
on their business or operations.



In
support of former New Jersey Governor Corzine's Economic Assistance and Recovery
Plan, JCP&L announced a proposal to spend approximately $98 million on
infrastructure and energy efficiency projects in 2009. Under the proposal, an
estimated $40 million would be spent on infrastructure projects, including
substation upgrades, new transformers, distribution line re-closers and
automated breaker operations. In addition, approximately $34 million would be
spent implementing new demand response programs as well as expanding on existing
programs. Another $11 million would be spent on energy efficiency, specifically
replacing transformers and capacitor control systems and installing new LED
street lights. The remaining $13 million would be spent on energy efficiency
programs that would complement those currently being offered. The project
relating to expansion of the existing demand response programs was approved by
the NJBPU on August 19, 2009, and implementation began in 2009. Approval for the
$11 million project related to energy efficiency programs intended to complement
those currently being offered was denied by the NJBPU on December 1, 2009.
Implementation of the remaining projects is dependent upon resolution of
regulatory issues between the NJBPU and JCP&L including recovery of the
costs associated with the proposal.



On
February 11, 2010, S&P downgraded the senior unsecured debt of FirstEnergy
Corp. to BB+.  As a result, pursuant to the requirements of a
pre-existing NJBPU order, JCP&L filed, on February 17, 2010, a plan
addressing the mitigation of any effect of the downgrade and provided an
assessment of present and future liquidity necessary to assure JCP&L’s
continued payment to BGS suppliers.  The order also provides that the
NJBPU should: 1) within 10 days of that filing, hold a public hearing to review
the plan and consider the available options and 2) within 30 days of that filing
issue an order with respect to the matter.  At this time, the public
hearing has not been scheduled and FirstEnergy and JCP&L cannot determine
the impact, if any, these proceedings will have on their
operations.



FERC
Matters



Transmission
Service between MISO and PJM










PJM
Transmission Rate





On May
18, 2007, certain parties filed for rehearing of the FERC’s April 19, 2007
order. On January 31, 2008, the requests for rehearing were denied. On February
11, 2008, the FERC’s April 19, 2007, and January 31, 2008, orders were appealed
to the federal Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The Illinois Commerce
Commission, the PUCO and another party have also appealed these orders to the
Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals of these parties and others were
consolidated for argument in the Seventh Circuit and the Seventh Circuit Court
of Appeals issued a decision on August 6, 2009. The court found that FERC had
not marshaled enough evidence to support its decision to allocate cost for new
500+kV facilities on a postage-stamp basis and, based on this finding, remanded
the rate design issue back to FERC. A request for rehearing and rehearing en
banc by two companies was denied by the Seventh Circuit on October 20,
2009. On October 28, 2009, the Seventh Circuit closed its case dockets and
returned the case to FERC for further action on the remand order. In an order
dated January 21, 2010, FERC set the matter for “paper hearings” – meaning that
FERC called for parties to submit comments or written testimony pursuant to the
schedule described in the order. FERC identified nine separate issues for
comments, and directed PJM to file the first round of comments on February 22,
2010, with other parties submitting responsive comments on April 8, 2010 and May
10, 2010.





RTO
Consolidation



On
August 17, 2009, FirstEnergy filed an application with the FERC requesting to
consolidate its transmission assets and operations into PJM. Currently,
FirstEnergy’s transmission assets and operations are divided between PJM and
MISO. The consolidation would make the transmission assets that are part of
ATSI, whose footprint includes the Ohio Companies and Penn, part of PJM. Most of
FirstEnergy’s transmission assets in Pennsylvania and all of the transmission
assets in New Jersey already operate as a part of PJM. Key elements of the
filing include a Fixed Resource Requirement Plan (FRR Plan) that describes the
means whereby capacity will be procured and administered as necessary to satisfy
the PJM capacity requirements for the 2011-12 and 2012-13 delivery years; and
also a request that ATSI’s transmission customers be excused from the costs for
regional transmission projects that were approved through PJM’s RTEP process
prior to ATSI’s entry into PJM (legacy RTEP costs). The integration is expected
to be complete on June 1, 2011, to coincide with delivery of power under the
next competitive generation procurement process for the Ohio Companies and Penn.
To ensure a definitive ruling at the same time the FERC rules on its request to
integrate ATSI into PJM, on October 19, 2009, FirstEnergy filed a related
complaint with the FERC on the issue of exempting the ATSI footprint from the
legacy RTEP costs.








On
September 4, 2009, the PUCO opened a case to take comments from Ohio’s
stakeholders regarding the RTO consolidation. FirstEnergy filed extensive
comments in the PUCO case on September 25, 2009, and reply comments on
October 13, 2009, and attended a public meeting on September 15, 2009
to answer questions regarding the RTO consolidation. Several parties have
intervened in the regulatory dockets at the FERC and at the PUCO. Certain
interveners have commented and protested particular elements of the proposed RTO
consolidation, including an exit fee to MISO, integration costs to PJM, and
cost-allocations of future transmission upgrades in PJM and MISO.



On
December 17, 2009, FERC issued an order approving, subject to certain future
compliance filings, ATSI’s move to PJM. FirstEnergy’s request to be exempted
from legacy RTEP costs was rejected and its complaint dismissed.



On
December 17, 2009, ATSI executed the PJM Consolidated Transmission Owners
Agreement. On December 18, 2009, the Ohio Companies and Penn executed the PJM
Operating Agreement and the PJM Reliability Assurance Agreement. Execution of
these agreements committed ATSI and the Ohio Companies and Penn’s load to moving
into PJM on the schedule described in the application and approved in the FERC
Order (June 1, 2011).



On
January 15, 2010, the Ohio Companies and Penn submitted a compliance filing
describing the process whereby ATSI-zone load serving entities (LSEs) can “opt
out” of the Ohio Companies' and Penn's FRR Plan for the 2011-12 and 2012-13
Delivery Years. On January 16, 2010, FirstEnergy filed for clarification or
rehearing of certain issues associated with implementing the  FRR
auctions on the proposed schedule. On January 19, 2010, FirstEnergy filed for
rehearing of FERC’s decision to impose the legacy RTEP costs on ATSI’s
transmission customers. Also on January 19, 2010, several parties, including the
PUCO and the OCC asked for rehearing of parts of FERC’s order. None of the
rehearing parties asked FERC to rescind authorization for ATSI to enter PJM.
Instead, parties focused on questions of cost and cost allocation or on alleged
errors in implementing the move.  On February 3, 2010, FirstEnergy
filed an answer to the January 19, 2010 rehearing request of other parties. On
February 16, 2010, FirstEnergy submitted a second compliance filing to FERC; the
filing describes communications protocols and performance deficiency penalties
for capacity suppliers that are taken in FRR auctions.



FirstEnergy
will conduct FRR auctions on March 15-19, 2010, for the 2011-12 and 2012-13
delivery years. LSE’s in the ATSI territory, including the Ohio Companies and
Penn, will participate in PJM’s next base residual auction for capacity
resources for the 2013-2014 delivery years. This auction will be conducted in
May of 2010. FirstEnergy expects to integrate into PJM effective June 1,
2011.



Changes
ordered for PJM Reliability Pricing Model (RPM) Auction



On
May 30, 2008, a group of PJM load-serving entities, state commissions,
consumer advocates, and trade associations (referred to collectively as the RPM
Buyers) filed a complaint at the FERC against PJM alleging that three of
the four transitional RPM auctions yielded prices that are unjust and
unreasonable under the Federal Power Act. On September 19, 2008, the FERC
denied the RPM Buyers’ complaint. On December 12, 2008, PJM filed proposed
tariff amendments that would adjust slightly the RPM program. PJM also requested
that the FERC conduct a settlement hearing to address changes to the RPM and
suggested that the FERC should rule on the tariff amendments only if settlement
could not be reached in January 2009. The request for settlement hearings was
granted. Settlement had not been reached by January 9, 2009 and, accordingly,
FirstEnergy and other parties submitted comments on PJM’s proposed tariff
amendments. On January 15, 2009, the Chief Judge issued an order terminating
settlement discussions. On February 9, 2009, PJM and a group of
stakeholders submitted an offer of settlement, which used the PJM
December 12, 2008 filing as its starting point, and stated that unless
otherwise specified, provisions filed by PJM on December 12, 2008
apply.



On March
26, 2009, the FERC accepted in part, and rejected in part, tariff provisions
submitted by PJM, revising certain parts of its RPM. It ordered changes included
making incremental improvements to RPM and clarification on certain aspects
of the March 26, 2009 Order. On April 27, 2009, PJM submitted a
compliance filing addressing the changes the FERC ordered in the March 26,
2009 Order; subsequently, numerous parties filed requests for rehearing of the
March 26, 2009 Order. On June 18, 2009, the FERC denied rehearing and
request for oral argument of the March 26, 2009 Order.



PJM has
reconvened the CMEC and has scheduled a CMEC Long-Term Issues Symposium to
address near-term changes directed by the March 26, 2009 Order and other
long-term issues not addressed in the February 2009 settlement. PJM made a
compliance filing on September 1, 2009, incorporating tariff changes directed by
the March 26, 2009 Order. The tariff changes were approved by the FERC in an
order issued on October 30, 2009, and are effective November 1, 2009.
The CMEC continues to work to address additional compliance items directed by
the March 26, 2009 Order. On December 1, 2009, PJM informed FERC that PJM
would file a scarcity-pricing design with the FERC on April 1,
2010.








MISO-PJM
Billing Dispute



In
September 2009, PJM reported that it had discovered a modeling error in the
market-to-market power flow calculations between PJM and the MISO under the
Joint Operating Agreement. The error, which dates back to 2005, was a result of
the incorrect modeling of certain generation resources that have an impact on
power flows across the PJM-MISO border. FERC settlement discussions on this
issue have commenced, and FirstEnergy is participating in these discussions. The
next settlement conference is set for February 25, 2010.  Although the
amount of the error is subject to dispute, PJM has estimated the magnitude of
the error to be approximately $77 million in total to all parties. Should a
payment by PJM to the MISO relating to the modeling error be required, the
method by which PJM would collect such payments from PJM participants, and how
MISO would allocate payments received to MISO participants, is uncertain at this
time.



MISO
Resource Adequacy Proposal



MISO
made a filing on December 28, 2007 that would create an enforceable planning
reserve requirement in the MISO tariff for load-serving entities such as the
Ohio Companies, Penn and FES. This requirement was proposed to become effective
for the planning year beginning June 1, 2009. The filing would permit MISO to
establish the reserve margin requirement for load-serving entities based upon a
one day loss of load in ten years standard, unless the state utility regulatory
agency establishes a different planning reserve for load-serving entities in its
state. FirstEnergy believes the proposal promotes a mechanism that will result
in commitments from both load-serving entities and resources, including both
generation and demand side resources that are necessary for reliable resource
adequacy and planning in the MISO footprint. The FERC conditionally approved
MISO’s Resource Adequacy proposal on March 26, 2008. On June 25, 2008, MISO
submitted a second compliance filing establishing the enforcement mechanism for
the reserve margin requirement which establishes deficiency payments for
load-serving entities that do not meet the resource adequacy requirements.
Numerous parties, including FirstEnergy, protested this filing.





FES
Sales to Affiliates



FES
supplied all of the power requirements for the Ohio Companies pursuant to a PSA
that ended on December 31, 2008. On January 2, 2009, FES signed an
agreement to provide 75% of the Ohio Companies’ power requirements for the
period January 5, 2009 through March 31, 2009. Subsequently, FES
signed an agreement to provide 100% of the Ohio Companies’ power requirements
for the period April 1, 2009 through May 31, 2009. On March 4,
2009, the PUCO issued an order approving these two affiliate sales agreements.
FERC authorization for these affiliate sales was by means of a December 23,
2008 waiver of restrictions on affiliate sales without prior approval of the
FERC. Rehearing was denied on July 31, 2009. On October 19, 2009, the FERC
accepted FirstEnergy’s revised tariffs.



On May
13-14, 2009, FES participated in a descending clock auction for PLR service
administered by the Ohio Companies and their consultant, CRA International. FES
won 51 tranches in the auction, and entered into a Master SSO Supply Agreement
to provide capacity, energy, ancillary services and transmission to the Ohio
Companies for a two-year period beginning June 1, 2009.  Other winning
suppliers have assigned their Master SSO Supply Agreements to FES, five of which
were effective in June, two more in July, four more in August and ten more in
September, 2009.  FES also supplies power used by Constellation to
serve an additional five tranches.  As a result of these arrangements,
FES serves 77 tranches, or 77% of the PLR load of the Ohio
Companies.








On
November 3, 2009, FES, Met-Ed, Penelec and Waverly restated their partial
requirements power purchase agreement for 2010. The Fourth Restated Partial
Requirements Agreement (PRA) continues to limit the amount of capacity resources
required to be supplied by FES to 3,544 MW, but requires FES to supply
essentially all of Met-Ed, Penelec, and Waverly’s energy requirements in 2010.
Under the Fourth Restated Partial Requirements Agreement, Met-Ed, Penelec, and
Waverly (Buyers) assigned 1,300 MW of existing energy purchases to FES to assist
it in supplying Buyers’ power supply requirements and managing congestion
expenses. FES can either sell the assigned power from the third party into
the market or use it to serve the Met-Ed/Penelec load. FES is responsible for
obtaining additional power supplies in the event of failure of supply of the
assigned energy purchase contracts. Prices for the power sold by FES under the
Fourth Restated Partial Requirements Agreement were increased to $42.77 and
$44.42, respectively for Met-Ed and Penelec. In addition, FES agreed to
reimburse Met-Ed and Penelec, respectively, for congestion expenses and marginal
losses in excess of $208 million and $79 million, respectively, as billed
by PJM in 2010, and associated with delivery of power by FES under the Fourth
Restated Partial Requirements Agreement. The Fourth Restated Partial
Requirements Agreement terminates at the end of 2010.



The
Yards Creek Pumped Storage Project is a 400 MW hydroelectric project located in
Warren County, New Jersey.  JCP&L owns an undivided 50% interest
in the project, and JCP&L operates the project. PSEG Fossil, LLC, a
subsidiary of Public Service Enterprise Group, owns the remaining interest in
the plant. The project was constructed in the early 1960s, and became
operational in 1965.  Authorization to operate the project is by a
license issued by the FERC.  The existing license expires on February
28, 2013.



FirstEnergy
and PSEG desire to renew the license and, to that end, on January 11, 2008,
JCP&L and PSEG Fossil submitted the initial documents necessary to obtain a
new license for the project.  The process for relicensing (renewing
the license for) a hydroelectric project is described in FERC’s Integrated
Licensing Process (ILP) regulations.  The ILP regulations call for
numerous environmental, operational, structural and safety and other studies to
be conducted as part of the relicensing process.  Although some of
these studies were initiated in 2009, the bulk of the studies will be performed
in 2010 – all for the purpose of submitting the application for a new license on
February 28, 2011.  The ILP regulations provide for opportunity for
public notice and comment as part of many of these study processes; meaning that
federal and state regulatory agencies, as well as members of the public, will
have amply opportunity to participate in the relicensing process.  The
ILP regulations provide significant discretion for FERC to set a procedural
schedule to act on the license application; meaning that FirstEnergy is not able
at this time to predict when FERC will take final action in issuing the new
license for the Yards Creek project.  To the extent, however that the
license proceedings extend beyond the February 28, 2013 expiration date for the
current license, the current license will be extended as necessary to permit
FERC to issue the new license.



Capital
Requirements



Our
capital spending for 2010 is expected to be approximately $1.65 billion
(excluding nuclear fuel), of which $241 million relates to Sammis AQC
system expenditures. Capital spending for 2011 and 2012 is expected to be
approximately $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion each year. Our capital
investments for additional nuclear fuel during 2010 are estimated to be
approximately $203 million.



Anticipated
capital expenditures for the Utilities, FES and FirstEnergy’s other subsidiaries
for 2010, excluding nuclear fuel, are shown in the following table. Such costs
include expenditures for the betterment of existing facilities and for the
construction of generating capacity, facilities for environmental compliance,
transmission lines, distribution lines, substations and other
assets.

FirstEnergy
expects its existing sources of liquidity to remain sufficient to meet its
anticipated obligations and those of its subsidiaries. FirstEnergy and its
subsidiaries' business is capital intensive, requiring significant resources to
fund operating expenses, construction expenditures, scheduled debt maturities
and interest and dividend payments. During 2009 and in subsequent years,
FirstEnergy expects to satisfy these requirements with a combination of cash
from operations and funds from the capital markets. FirstEnergy also expects
that borrowing capacity under credit facilities will continue to be available to
manage working capital requirements during those periods.



FirstEnergy
had approximately $1.2 billion of short-term indebtedness as of
December 31, 2009, comprised of $1.1 billion in borrowings under the
$2.75 billion revolving line of credit described below, $100 million
of other bank borrowings and $31 million of currently payable notes. Total
short-term bank lines of committed credit to FirstEnergy, FES and the Utilities
as of January 31, 2010 were approximately $3.4 billion.



FirstEnergy,
along with certain of its subsidiaries, are party to a $2.75 billion five-year
revolving credit facility. FirstEnergy has the ability to request an increase in
the total commitments available under this facility up to a maximum of
$3.25 billion, subject to the discretion of each lender to provide
additional commitments. Commitments under the facility are available until
August 24, 2012, unless the lenders agree, at the request of the borrowers, to
an unlimited number of additional one-year extensions. Generally, borrowings
under the facility must be repaid within 364 days. Available amounts for each
borrower are subject to a specified sub-limit, as well as applicable regulatory
and other limitations. The annual facility fee is 0.125%.






As of
January 31, 2010, FES had a $100 million bank credit facility in addition
to a $1 billion credit limit associated with FirstEnergy's
$2.75 billion revolving credit facility. Also, an aggregate of
$515 million of accounts receivable financing facilities through the Ohio
and Pennsylvania Companies may be accessed to meet working capital requirements
and for other general corporate purposes. FirstEnergy's available liquidity as
of January 31, 2010, is described in the following table.

      renewed expiring receivables facilities on an annual basis and expect to
      continue that practice as market conditions and the continued quality of
      receivables permit.



FirstEnergy's
primary source of cash for continuing operations as a holding company is cash
from the operations of its subsidiaries. During 2009, the holding company
received $972 million of cash dividends on common stock from its
subsidiaries and paid $670 million in cash dividends to common
shareholders.





To the
extent that coverage requirements or market conditions restrict the
subsidiaries’ abilities to issue desired amounts of FMBs or preferred stock,
they may seek other methods of financing. Such financings could include the sale
of preferred and/or preference stock or of such other types of securities as
might be authorized by applicable regulatory authorities which would not
otherwise be sold and could result in annual interest charges and/or dividend
requirements in excess of those that would otherwise be incurred.



On
September 22, 2008, the Shelf Registrants filed an automatically effective shelf
registration statement with the SEC for an unspecified number and amount of
securities to be offered thereon. The shelf registration provides FirstEnergy
the flexibility to issue and sell various types of securities, including common
stock, preferred stock, debt securities, warrants, share purchase contracts, and
share purchase units. The Shelf Registrants may utilize the shelf registration
statement to offer and sell unsecured, and in some cases, secured debt
securities.



Nuclear
Operating Licenses



In
August 2007, FENOC submitted an application to the NRC to renew the operating
licenses for the Beaver Valley Power Station (Units 1 and 2) for an additional
20 years. On November 5, 2009, the NRC issued a renewed operating license
for Beaver Valley Power Station, Units 1 and 2. The operating licenses for these
facilities were extended until 2036 and 2047 for Units 1 and 2,
respectively.






Each of
the nuclear units in the FES portfolio operates under a 40-year operating
license granted by the NRC. The following table summarizes the current operating
license expiration dates for FES’ nuclear facilities in service.

Nuclear
Regulation





Nuclear
Insurance



The
Price-Anderson Act limits the public liability which can be assessed with
respect to a nuclear power plant to $12.6 billion (assuming 104 units
licensed to operate) for a single nuclear incident, which amount is covered by:
(i) private insurance amounting to $375 million; and (ii)
$12.2 billion provided by an industry retrospective rating plan required by
the NRC pursuant thereto. Under such retrospective rating plan, in the event of
a nuclear incident at any unit in the United States resulting in losses in
excess of private insurance, up to $118 million (but not more than
$18 million per unit per year in the event of more than one incident) must
be contributed for each nuclear unit licensed to operate in the country by the
licensees thereof to cover liabilities arising out of the incident. Based on
their present nuclear ownership and leasehold interests, FirstEnergy’s maximum
potential assessment under these provisions would be $470 million
(OE-$40 million, NGC-$408 million, and TE-$22 million) per
incident but not more than $70 million (OE-$6 million,
NGC-$61 million, and TE-$3 million) in any one year for each
incident.



In
addition to the public liability insurance provided pursuant to the
Price-Anderson Act, FirstEnergy has also obtained insurance coverage in limited
amounts for economic loss and property damage arising out of nuclear incidents.
FirstEnergy is a member of NEIL which provides coverage (NEIL I) for the
extra expense of replacement power incurred due to prolonged accidental outages
of nuclear units. Under NEIL I, FirstEnergy’s subsidiaries have policies,
renewable yearly, corresponding to their respective nuclear interests, which
provide an aggregate indemnity of up to approximately $560 million
(OE-$48 million, NGC-$486 million, TE-$26 million) for replacement
power costs incurred during an outage after an initial 20-week waiting period.
Members of NEIL I pay annual premiums and are subject to assessments if losses
exceed the accumulated funds available to the insurer. FirstEnergy’s present
maximum aggregate assessment for incidents at any covered nuclear facility
occurring during a policy year would be approximately $3 million
(NGC-$3 million).



FirstEnergy
is insured as to its respective nuclear interests under property damage
insurance provided by NEIL to the operating company for each plant. Under these
arrangements, up to $2.8 billion of coverage for decontamination costs,
decommissioning costs, debris removal and repair and/or replacement of property
is provided. FirstEnergy pays annual premiums for this coverage and is liable
for retrospective assessments of up to approximately $60 million
(OE-$6 million, NGC-$51 million, TE-$2 million, Met Ed, Penelec and
JCP&L- less than $1 million in total) during a policy
year.






FirstEnergy
intends to maintain insurance against nuclear risks as described above as long
as it is available. To the extent that replacement power, property damage,
decontamination, decommissioning, repair and replacement costs and other such
costs arising from a nuclear incident at any of FirstEnergy’s plants exceed the
policy limits of the insurance in effect with respect to that plant, to the
extent a nuclear incident is determined not to be covered by FirstEnergy’s
insurance policies, or to the extent such insurance becomes unavailable in the
future, FirstEnergy would remain at risk for such costs.



The NRC
requires nuclear power plant licensees to obtain minimum property insurance
coverage of $1.1 billion or the amount generally available from private
sources, whichever is less. The proceeds of this insurance are required to be
used first to ensure that the licensed reactor is in a safe and stable condition
and can be maintained in that condition so as to prevent any significant risk to
the public health and safety. Within 30 days of stabilization, the licensee is
required to prepare and submit to the NRC a cleanup plan for approval. The plan
is required to identify all cleanup operations necessary to decontaminate the
reactor sufficiently to permit the resumption of operations or to commence
decommissioning. Any property insurance proceeds not already expended to place
the reactor in a safe and stable condition must be used first to complete those
decontamination operations that are ordered by the NRC. FirstEnergy is unable to
predict what effect these requirements may have on the availability of insurance
proceeds.



Environmental
Matters



Various
federal, state and local authorities regulate FirstEnergy with regard to air and
water quality and other environmental matters. The effects of compliance on
FirstEnergy with regard to environmental matters could have a material adverse
effect on FirstEnergy's earnings and competitive position to the extent that it
competes with companies that are not subject to such regulations and, therefore,
do not bear the risk of costs associated with compliance, or failure to comply,
with such regulations.



FirstEnergy
accrues environmental liabilities only when it concludes that it is probable
that it has an obligation for such costs and can reasonably estimate the amount
of such costs. Unasserted claims are reflected in FirstEnergy’s determination of
environmental liabilities and are accrued in the period that they become both
probable and reasonably estimable.



Clean
Air Act Compliance



FirstEnergy
is required to meet federally-approved SO2emissions
regulations. Violations of such regulations can result in the shutdown of the
generating unit involved and/or civil or criminal penalties of up to $37,500 for
each day the unit is in violation. The EPA has an interim enforcement policy for
SO2regulations in Ohio that allows for compliance based on a 30-day averaging
period. FirstEnergy believes it is currently in compliance with this policy, but
cannot predict what action the EPA may take in the future with respect to the
interim enforcement policy.



FirstEnergy
complies with SO2reduction
requirements under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 by burning lower-sulfur
fuel, generating more electricity from lower-emitting plants, and/or using
emission allowances. NOXreductions
required by the 1990 Amendments are being achieved through combustion controls,
the generation of more electricity at lower-emitting plants, and/or using
emission allowances. In September 1998, the EPA finalized regulations requiring
additional NOXreductions
at FirstEnergy's facilities. The EPA's NOXTransport
Rule imposes uniform reductions of NOXemissions
(an approximate 85% reduction in utility plant NOXemissions
from projected 2007 emissions) across a region of nineteen states (including
Michigan, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania) and the District of Columbia based
on a conclusion that such NOXemissions
are contributing significantly to ozone levels in the eastern United States.
FirstEnergy believes its facilities are also complying with the NOXbudgets
established under SIPs through combustion controls and post-combustion controls,
including Selective Catalytic Reduction and SNCR systems, and/or using emission
allowances.



In 1999
and 2000, the EPA issued an NOV and the DOJ filed a civil complaint against OE
and Penn based on operation and maintenance of the W. H. Sammis Plant (Sammis
NSR Litigation) and filed similar complaints involving 44 other U.S. power
plants. This case and seven other similar cases are referred to as the NSR
cases. OE’s and Penn’s settlement with the EPA, the DOJ and three states
(Connecticut, New Jersey and New York) that resolved all issues related to the
Sammis NSR litigation was approved by the Court on July 11, 2005. This
settlement agreement, in the form of a consent decree, requires reductions of
NOXand SO2emissions
at the Sammis, Burger, Eastlake and Mansfield coal-fired plants through the
installation of pollution control devices or repowering and provides for
stipulated penalties for failure to install and operate such pollution controls
or complete repowering in accordance with that agreement. Capital expenditures
necessary to complete requirements of the Sammis NSR Litigation consent decree,
including repowering Burger Units 4 and 5 for biomass fuel consumption, are
currently estimated to be $399 million for 2010-2012.








In
December 2007, the state of New Jersey filed a CAA citizen suit alleging NSR
violations at the Portland Generation Station against Reliant (the current owner
and operator), Sithe Energy (the purchaser of the Portland Station from Met-Ed
in 1999), GPU and Met-Ed. On October 30, 2008, the state of Connecticut
filed a Motion to Intervene, which the Court granted on March 24, 2009.
Specifically, Connecticut and New Jersey allege that "modifications" at Portland
Units 1 and 2 occurred between 1980 and 2005 without preconstruction NSR or
permitting under the CAA's PSD program, and seek injunctive relief, penalties,
attorney fees and mitigation of the harm caused by excess emissions. The scope
of Met-Ed’s indemnity obligation to and from Sithe Energy is disputed. Met-Ed
filed a Motion to Dismiss the claims in New Jersey’s Amended Complaint and
Connecticut’s Complaint in February and September of 2009,
respectively. The Court granted Met-Ed's motion to dismiss New Jersey’s and
Connecticut’s claims for injunctive relief against Met-Ed, but denied Met-Ed’s
motion to dismiss the claims for civil penalties on statute of limitations
grounds in order to allow the states to prove either that the application of the
discovery rule or the doctrine of equitable tolling bars application of the
statute of limitations.



In
January 2009, the EPA issued a NOV to Reliant alleging NSR violations at
the Portland Generation Station based on “modifications” dating back to 1986.
Met-Ed is unable to predict the outcome of this matter. The EPA’s
January 2009, NOV also alleged NSR violations at the Keystone and Shawville
Stations based on “modifications” dating back to 1984. JCP&L, as the former
owner of 16.67% of the Keystone Station, and Penelec, as former owner and
operator of the Shawville Station, are unable to predict the outcome of this
matter.



In June
2008, the EPA issued a Notice and Finding of Violation to Mission Energy
Westside, Inc. alleging that "modifications" at the Homer City Power Station
occurred since 1988 to the present without preconstruction NSR or permitting
under the CAA's PSD program. Mission Energy is seeking indemnification from
Penelec, the co-owner (along with New York State Electric and Gas Company) and
operator of the Homer City Power Station prior to its sale in 1999. The scope of
Penelec’s indemnity obligation to and from Mission Energy is disputed. Penelec
is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.



In
August 2009, the EPA issued a Finding of Violation and NOV alleging violations
of the CAA and Ohio regulations, including the PSD, NNSR, and Title V
regulations at the Eastlake, Lakeshore, Bay Shore, and Ashtabula generating
plants. The EPA’s NOV alleges equipment replacements occurring during
maintenance outages dating back to 1990 triggered the pre-construction
permitting requirements under the PSD and NNSR programs. In September 2009,
FGCO received an information request pursuant to Section 114(a) of the CAA
requesting certain operating and maintenance information and planning
information regarding the Eastlake, Lake Shore, Bay Shore and Ashtabula
generating plants. On November 3, 2009, FGCO received a letter providing
notification that the EPA is evaluating whether certain scheduled
maintenance at the Eastlake generating plant may constitute a major
modification under the NSR provision of the CAA. On December 23, 2009, FGCO
received another information request regarding emission projections for the
Eastlake generating plant pursuant to Section 114(a) of the CAA. FGCO intends to
comply with the CAA, including EPA’s information requests, but, at this time, is
unable to predict the outcome of this matter. A June 2006 finding of
violation and NOV in which EPA alleged CAA violations at the Bay Shore
Generating Plant remains unresolved and FGCO is unable to predict the outcome of
such matter.



In
August 2008, FirstEnergy received a request from the EPA for information
pursuant to Section 114(a) of the CAA for certain operating and maintenance
information regarding its formerly-owned Avon Lake and Niles generating plants,
as well as a copy of a nearly identical request directed to the current owner,
Reliant Energy, to allow the EPA to determine whether these generating sources
are complying with the NSR provisions of the CAA. FirstEnergy intends to fully
comply with the EPA’s information request, but, at this time, is unable to
predict the outcome of this matter.

Emissions

Pennsylvania
has submitted a new mercury rule for EPA approval that does not provide a
cap-and-trade approach as in the CAMR, but rather follows a command-and-control
approach imposing emission limits on individual sources. On December 23, 2009,
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the Commonwealth Court of
Pennsylvania ruling that Pennsylvania’s mercury rule is “unlawful, invalid and
unenforceable” and enjoined the Commonwealth from continued implementation or
enforcement of that rule.



Climate
Change



In
December 1997, delegates to the United Nations' climate summit in Japan adopted
an agreement, the Kyoto Protocol, to address global warming by reducing, by
2012, the amount of man-made GHG, including CO2, emitted
by developed countries. The United States signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 but
it was never submitted for ratification by the United States Senate. The EPACT
established a Committee on Climate Change Technology to coordinate federal
climate change activities and promote the development and deployment of GHG
reducing technologies. President Obama has announced his Administration’s “New
Energy for America Plan” that includes, among other provisions, ensuring that
10% of electricity used in the United States comes from renewable sources by
2012, increasing to 25% by 2025, and implementing an economy-wide cap-and-trade
program to reduce GHG emissions by 80% by 2050.












On
September 21, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and on
October 16, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, reversed and
remanded lower court decisions that had dismissed complaints alleging damage
from GHG emissions on jurisdictional grounds. These cases involve common law
tort claims, including public and private nuisance, alleging that GHG emissions
contribute to global warming and result in property damages. While FirstEnergy
is not a party to either litigation, should the courts of appeals decisions be
affirmed or not subjected to further review, FirstEnergy and/or one or more of
its subsidiaries could be named in actions making similar
allegations.



FirstEnergy
cannot currently estimate the financial impact of climate change policies,
although potential legislative or regulatory programs restricting CO2emissions,
or litigation alleging damages from GHG emissions, could require significant
capital and other expenditures or result in changes to its operations. The
CO2emissions per KWH of electricity generated by FirstEnergy is lower than many
regional competitors due to its diversified generation sources, which include
low or non-CO2emitting
gas-fired and nuclear generators.



Clean
Water Act



Various
water quality regulations, the majority of which are the result of the federal
Clean Water Act and its amendments, apply to FirstEnergy's plants. In addition,
Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have water quality standards applicable to
FirstEnergy's operations. As provided in the Clean Water Act, authority to grant
federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System water discharge permits
can be assumed by a state. Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania have assumed such
authority.








The U.S.
Attorney's Office in Cleveland, Ohio has advised FGCO that it is considering
prosecution under the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act for
three petroleum spills at the Edgewater, Lakeshore and Bay Shore plants which
occurred on November 1, 2005, January 26, 2007 and February 27, 2007.
FGCO is unable to predict the outcome of this matter.



Regulation
of Waste Disposal





The
Utilities have been named as potentially responsible parties at waste disposal
sites, which may require cleanup under the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980. Allegations of disposal of hazardous
substances at historical sites and the liability involved are often
unsubstantiated and subject to dispute; however, federal law provides that all
potentially responsible parties for a particular site may be liable on a joint
and several basis. Environmental liabilities that are considered probable have
been recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009, based
on estimates of the total costs of cleanup, the Utilities' proportionate
responsibility for such costs and the financial ability of other unaffiliated
entities to pay. Total liabilities of approximately $101 million (JCP&L
- - $74 million, TE - $1 million, CEI - $1 million, FGCO -
$1 million and FirstEnergy - $24 million) have been accrued through
December 31, 2009. Included in the total are accrued liabilities of
approximately $67 million for environmental remediation of former
manufactured gas plants and gas holder facilities in New Jersey, which are being
recovered by JCP&L through a non-bypassable SBC.



Fuel
Supply



FES
currently has long-term coal contracts with various terms to acquire
approximately 22.7 million tons of coal for the year 2010, approximately
109% of its 2010 coal requirements of 20.8 million tons. This contract coal is
produced primarily from mines located in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, West
Virginia, Montana and Wyoming. The contracts expire at various times through
December 31, 2030. See “Environmental Matters” for factors pertaining to
meeting environmental regulations affecting coal-fired generating
units.






In July
2008, FEV entered into a joint venture with the Boich Companies, a Columbus,
Ohio-based coal company, to acquire a majority stake in the Bull Mountain Mine
Operations, now called Signal Peak, near Roundup, Montana. This joint venture is
part of FirstEnergy’s strategy to secure high-quality fuel supplies at
attractive prices to maximize the capacity of its fossil generating plants. In a
related transaction, FGCO entered into a 15-year agreement to purchase up to
10 million tons of bituminous western coal annually from the mine.
FirstEnergy also entered into agreements with the rail carriers associated with
transporting coal from the mine to its generating stations, and began taking
delivery of the coal in late 2009. The joint venture has the right to resell
Signal Peak coal tonnage not used at FirstEnergy facilities and has call rights
on such coal above certain levels.



FirstEnergy
has contracts for all uranium requirements through 2011 and a portion of uranium
material requirements through 2016. Conversion services contracts fully cover
requirements through 2011 and partially fill requirements through 2016.
Enrichment services are contracted for essentially all of the enrichment
requirements for nuclear fuel through 2017. A portion of enrichment requirements
is also contracted for through 2024. Fabrication services for fuel assemblies
are contracted for both Beaver Valley units and Davis Besse through 2013 and
through the current operating license period for Perry (through approximately
2026). The Davis-Besse fabrication contract also has an extension provision for
services for additional consecutive reload batches through the current operating
license period (approximately 2017). In addition to the existing commitments,
FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for the supply of uranium
and for the subsequent conversion, enrichment, fabrication, and waste disposal
services.



On-site
spent fuel storage facilities are expected to be adequate for Perry through
2010; facilities at Beaver Valley Units 1 and 2 are expected to be adequate
through 2015 and 2010, respectively. Davis-Besse has adequate storage through
2017. After current on-site storage capacity at the plants is exhausted,
additional storage capacity will have to be obtained either through plant
modifications, interim off-site disposal, or permanent waste disposal
facilities. FENOC is currently taking actions to extend the spent fuel storage
capacity for Perry and Beaver Valley. Plant modifications to increase the
storage capacity of the existing spent fuel storage pool at Beaver Valley Unit 2
were submitted to the NRC for approval during the second quarter of 2009. The
NRC has requested additional information to complete the license review process
and this information will be provided in early 2010. Dry fuel storage is also
being pursued at Perry and Beaver Valley, with Perry implementation scheduled to
complete by the end of 2010 and Beaver Valley to be complete by the end of
2014.



The
Federal Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 provided for the construction of
facilities for the permanent disposal of high-level nuclear wastes, including
spent fuel from nuclear power plants operated by electric utilities. NGC has
contracts with the DOE for the disposal of spent fuel for Beaver Valley,
Davis-Besse and Perry. Yucca Mountain was approved in 2002 as a repository for
underground disposal of spent nuclear fuel from nuclear power plants and high
level waste from U.S. defense programs. The DOE submitted the license
application for Yucca Mountain to the NRC on June 3, 2008. However, the current
Administration has stated the Yucca Mountain repository will not be completed
and a Federal review of potential alternative strategies will be performed.
FirstEnergy intends to make additional arrangements for storage capacity as a
contingency for the continuing delays with the DOE acceptance of spent fuel for
disposal.



Fuel oil
and natural gas are used primarily to fuel peaking units and/or to ignite the
burners prior to burning coal when a coal-fired plant is restarted. Fuel oil
requirements have historically been low and are forecasted to remain so;
requirements are expected to average approximately 5 million gallons per
year over the next five years. Due to the volatility of fuel oil prices,
FirstEnergy has adopted a strategy of either purchasing fixed-priced oil for
inventory or using financial instruments to hedge against price risk. Natural
gas is currently consumed primarily by peaking units, and no natural gas demand
is forecasted in 2010. First Energy purchased a partially completed combined
cycle combustion turbine plant in Fremont Ohio. Construction is scheduled to be
completed in late 2010 and generation is forecasted for 2011. Because of high
price volatility and the unpredictability of unit dispatch, natural gas futures
are purchased based on forecasted demand to hedge against price
movements.



System
Demand



The 2009
net maximum hourly demand for each of the Utilities was:



·OE–5,156
      MW on June 25, 2009;



·Penn–879
      MW on June 25, 2009;



·CEI–3,843
      MW on June 25, 2009;



·TE–2,009
      MW on June 25, 2009;






·JCP&L–5,738
      MW on August 10, 2009;



·Met-Ed–2,839
      MW on August 10, 2009; and



·Penelec–2,679
      MW on August 10, 2009.



Supply
Plan



Regulated
Commodity Sourcing



The
Utilities have a default service obligation to provide the required power supply
to non-shopping customers who have elected to continue to receive service under
regulated retail tariffs. The volume of these sales can vary depending on the
level of shopping that occurs. Supply plans vary by state and by service
territory. JCP&L’s default service supply is secured through a statewide
competitive procurement process approved by the NJBPU. The Ohio Utilities and
Penn’s default service supplies are provided through a competitive procurement
process approved by the PUCO and PPUC, respectively. The default service supply
for Met-Ed and Penelec is secured through a FERC-approved agreement with FES,
but will move to a competitive procurement process in 2011. If any unaffiliated
suppliers fail to deliver power to any one of the Utilities’ service areas, the
Utility serving that area may need to procure the required power in the market
in their role as a PLR.



Unregulated
Commodity Sourcing



FES has
retail and wholesale competitive load-serving obligations in Ohio, New Jersey,
Maryland, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Illinois serving both affiliated and
non-affiliated companies. FES provides energy products and services to customers
under various PLR, shopping, competitive-bid and non-affiliated contractual
obligations. In 2009, FES’ generation was used to serve two main obligations.
Affiliated companies utilized approximately 76% of FES’ total generation. Direct
retail customers utilized approximately 18% of FES' total generation.
Geographically, approximately 67% of FES’ obligation is located in the MISO
market area and 33% is located in the PJM market area.



FES
provides energy and energy related services, including the generation and sale
of electricity and energy planning and procurement through retail and wholesale
competitive supply arrangements. FES controls (either through ownership, lease,
affiliated power contracts or participation in OVEC) 14,346 MW of installed
generating capacity. FES supplies the power requirements of its competitive
load-serving obligations through a combination of subsidiary-owned generation,
non-affiliated contracts and spot market transactions.



Regional
Reliability



FirstEnergy’s
operating companies are located within MISO and PJM and operate under the
reliability oversight of a regional entity known as ReliabilityFirst. This regional entity
operates under the oversight of the NERC in accordance with a Delegation
Agreement approved by the FERC. ReliabilityFirstbegan operations under
the NERC on January 1, 2006. On July 20, 2006, the NERC was certified by
the FERC as the ERO in the United States pursuant to Section 215 of the FPA and
ReliabilityFirstwas
certified as a regional entity. ReliabilityFirstrepresents the
consolidation of the ECAR, Mid-Atlantic Area Council, and Mid-American
Interconnected Network reliability councils into a single regional reliability
organization.



Competition



As a
result of actions taken by state legislative bodies, major changes in the
electric utility business have occurred in portions of the United States,
including Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania where FirstEnergy’s utility
subsidiaries operate. These changes have altered the way traditional integrated
utilities conduct their business. FirstEnergy has aligned its business units to
accommodate its retail strategy and participate in the competitive electricity
marketplace (see Management's Discussion and Analysis). FirstEnergy’s
Competitive Energy Services segment participates in deregulated energy markets
in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan, and Illinois through
FES.



In New
Jersey, JCP&L has procured electric generation supply to serve its BGS
customers since 2002 through a statewide auction process approved by the NJBPU.
The auction is designed to procure supply for BGS customers at a cost reflective
of market conditions. On May 1, 2008, the Governor of Ohio signed SB221
into law, which became effective July 31, 2008. The new law provides two
options for pricing generation in 2009 and beyond – through a negotiated rate
plan or a competitive bidding process (see PUCO Rate Matters above). In
Pennsylvania, all electric distribution companies will be required to secure
generation for customers in competitive markets by 2011.






FirstEnergy
remains focused on managing the transition to competitive markets for
electricity in Pennsylvania. On October 15, 2008, the Governor of
Pennsylvania signed House Bill 2200 into law, which became effective on
November 14, 2008, as Act 129 of 2008. The new law outlines a competitive
procurement process and sets targets for energy efficiency and conservation (see
PPUC Rate Matters above).



Research
and Development



The
Utilities, FES, and FENOC participate in the funding of EPRI, which was formed
for the purpose of expanding electric research and development (R&D) under
the voluntary sponsorship of the nation’s electric utility
industry - public, private and cooperative. Its goal is to mutually
benefit utilities and their customers by promoting the development of new and
improved technologies to help the utility industry meet present and future
electric energy needs in environmentally and economically acceptable ways. EPRI
conducts research on all aspects of electric power production and use, including
fuels, generation, delivery, energy management and conservation, environmental
effects and energy analysis. The majority of EPRI’s research and development
projects are directed toward practical solutions and their applications to
problems currently facing the electric utility industry.



FirstEnergy
participates in other initiatives with industry R&D consortiums and
universities to address technology needs for its various business units.
Participation in these consortiums helps the company address research needs in
areas such as plant operations and maintenance, major component reliability,
environmental controls, advanced energy technologies, and T&D System
infrastructure to improve performance, and develop new technologies for advanced
energy and grid applications.

JCP&L's
bargaining unit employees filed a grievance challenging JCP&L's 2002
call-out procedure that required bargaining unit employees to respond to
emergency power outages. On May 20, 2004, an arbitration panel concluded
that the call-out procedure violated the parties' collective bargaining
agreement. On September 9, 2005, the arbitration panel issued an opinion to
award approximately $16 million to the bargaining unit employees. A final
order identifying the individual damage amounts was issued on October 31,
2007 and the award appeal process was initiated. The union filed a motion with
the federal Court to confirm the award and JCP&L filed its answer and
counterclaim to vacate the award on December 31, 2007. JCP&L and the
union filed briefs in June and July of 2008 and oral arguments were held in the
fall. On February 25, 2009, the federal district court denied JCP&L’s
motion to vacate the arbitration decision and granted the union’s motion to
confirm the award. JCP&L filed a Notice of Appeal to the Third Circuit and a
Motion to Stay Enforcement of the Judgment on March 6, 2009. The appeal
process could take as long as 24 months. The parties are participating in the
federal court's mediation programs and have held private settlement discussions.
JCP&L recognized a liability for the potential $16 million award in
2005. Post-judgment interest began to accrue as of February 25, 2009, and
the liability will be adjusted accordingly.
