•driving long-term growth in sales, operating income and cash flows, through growth and productivity initiatives along with acquisitions;

•developing new products and enhancing existing products;

•penetrating attractive growth markets, particularly outside of the United States;

•expanding multi-channel distribution; and

•proactively managing our business portfolio for optimal value creation, including consideration of new business platforms.

Unless the context otherwise indicates, references herein to “Pentair,” the “Company,” and such words as “we,” “us,” and “our” include Pentair Ltd. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are a Swiss corporation limited by shares that was formed in 2000. We are the successor to Pentair, Inc., a Minnesota corporation formed in 1966 and our wholly-owned subsidiary, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).

HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT

Pentair Ltd. took its current form on September 28, 2012 as a result of a reverse acquisition (the "Merger") involving Pentair, Inc. and an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Flow Control (defined below), with Pentair, Inc. surviving as an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Pentair Ltd. "Flow Control" refers to Pentair Ltd. prior the Merger. Prior to the Merger, Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco") engaged in an internal restructuring whereby it transferred to Flow Control certain assets related to the flow control business of Tyco, and Flow Control assumed from Tyco certain liabilities related to the flow control business of Tyco. On September 28, 2012 prior to the Merger, Tyco effected a spin-off of Flow Control through the pro-rata distribution of100%of the outstanding common shares of Flow Control to Tyco’s shareholders (the “Distribution”), resulting in the distribution of approximately110.9 millionof our common shares to Tyco’s shareholders. The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting with Pentair, Inc. treated as the acquirer. After the Merger, our common shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol PNR.

On December 10, 2013, Pentair Ltd. entered into a Merger Agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Pentair plc, a newly-formed Irish public limited company and subsidiary of Pentair (“Pentair-Ireland”). Under the Merger Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Pentair will merge with and into Pentair-Ireland, with Pentair-Ireland being the surviving company (the “Redomicile”), thereby changing the jurisdiction of organization of the publicly-traded parent company from Switzerland to Ireland. Pentair shareholders will receive one ordinary share of Pentair-Ireland for each common share of Pentair held immediately prior to the Redomicile.

Upon completion of the Redomicile, Pentair-Ireland intends to manage its affairs so that it is centrally managed and controlled in the United Kingdom (the “U.K.”) and therefore have its tax residency in the U.K. Pentair-Ireland will continue to own and conduct the same businesses as Pentair owned and conducted prior to the Merger, except that Pentair-Ireland will replace Pentair as the publicly-traded parent company. Pentair-Ireland will remain subject to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) reporting requirements and the applicable corporate governance rules of the New York Stock Exchange.










The Redomicile is subject to Pentair shareholder approval of the Merger Agreement and certain other conditions. Pentair’s shareholders will be asked to vote to approve the Merger Agreement at an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders, which Pentair expects to be held during the second quarter of 2014.

We anticipate that having our publicly-traded parent company incorporated in Ireland and tax resident in the U.K. will provide us the following benefits:

•Incorporation of our publicly-traded parent company in Ireland would enable us to benefit by being subject to a legal and regulatory structure in a jurisdiction with a well-developed legal system and corporate law with established standards of corporate governance.

•The U.K. has a developed, stable and internationally competitive tax system.

•The legal requirements we will be subject to as a company incorporated in Ireland, listed on the NYSE and subject to SEC disclosure and shareholder voting requirements strike the right balance between robust external governance oversight and regulation of our executive and director pay practices and the ability of our compensation committee consisting of independent directors to determine executive compensation to provide incentives to our executive management and to offer competitive salaries and benefits.

Our registered principal office is located at Freier Platz 10, 8200 Schaffhausen, Switzerland. Our management office in the United States is located at 5500 Wayzata Boulevard, Suite 800, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS

Reporting segment and geographical financial information is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we reorganized our business segments to reflect a new operating structure and management of our Global Business Units, resulting in a change from three reporting segments to four. All prior period amounts related to the segment change have been retrospectively reclassified throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K to conform to the new presentation. The following is a brief description of each of the Company’s reportable segments and business activities.

A substantial portion of our revenues, however, result from orders received and product delivered in the same month. We record as part of our backlog all orders from external customers, which represent firm commitments, and are supported by a purchase order or other legitimate contract. We expect the majority of our backlog from all segments atDecember 31, 2013will be filled in2014.










Research and development

We conduct research and development activities primarily in our own facilities. These efforts consist primarily of the development of new products, product applications and manufacturing processes. Research and development expenditures during2013,2012and2011were$125.8 million,$93.6 millionand$78.2 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7 and ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Raw materials

The principal materials we use in manufacturing our products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels.

We purchase the materials we use in various manufacturing processes on the open market and the majority is available through multiple sources which are in adequate supply. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in the future.

Intellectual property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trademarks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trademark, trade name or brand name.

Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As ofDecember 31, 2013, we employed28,600people worldwide, of which9,300were in the United States and10,900were covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. We believe that our relations with the labor unions have generally been good.

Captive insurance subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property, workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain Non-U.S. operations are established.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Insurance Subsidiary, included in this Form 10-K.
