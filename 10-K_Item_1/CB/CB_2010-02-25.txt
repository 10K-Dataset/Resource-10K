ITEM 1.Business



General Development of Business

ACE Limited is the
Swiss-incorporated holding company of the ACE Group of Companies. ACE opened its business office in Bermuda in 1985 and continues to maintain operations in Bermuda. ACE Limited, which is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the ACE Group of Companies, ACE, the Company, we, us, or our) is a global insurance and reinsurance organization, serving the needs of commercial and individual customers in more than 140 countries and
jurisdictions. We serve the P&C insurance needs of businesses of all sizes in a broad range of industries. We also provide specialized insurance products – such as personal accident, supplemental health, and life insurance to individuals in
select countries. Our reinsurance operations include both P&C and life companies. At December 31, 2009, ACE had total assets of $78 billion and shareholders’ equity of $19.7 billion.

We have grown our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisition of other companies.
On April 1, 2008, ACE acquired all of the outstanding shares of Combined Insurance Company of America (Combined Insurance) and certain of its subsidiaries from Aon Corporation for $2.56 billion. Combined Insurance is an underwriter and
distributor of specialty supplemental accident and health insurance products targeted to middle-income consumers and small businesses in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Latin America. ACE recorded the Combined Insurance acquisition using
the purchase method of accounting. Our consolidated operating results include the results of Combined Insurance from April 1, 2008.



Employees

At December 31, 2009, there were approximately 15,000 employees in the ACE Group of Companies. We believe that employee relations are satisfactory.



Customers

For most of the commercial lines of business that we offer, insureds typically use the services of an insurance broker or agent. An insurance broker acts as an agent
for the insureds, offering advice on the types and amount of insurance to purchase and also assisting in the negotiation of price and terms and conditions. We obtain business from the local and major international insurance brokers and typically pay
a commission to brokers for any business accepted and bound. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In our opinion, no material part of our
business is dependent upon a single insured or group of insureds. We do not believe that the loss of any one insured would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and no one insured or group of affiliated
insureds account for as much as 10 percent of our consolidated revenues.



Competition

Competition in the insurance and reinsurance marketplace is substantial. Competition varies
by type of business and geographic area. Competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups (such as group captives and catastrophe pools), and other underwriting organizations. These companies sell
through various distribution channels and business models, across a broad array of product lines, and with a high level of variation regarding geographic, marketing, and customer segmentation. We compete for business not only on the basis of price,
but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service. Our ability to compete is dependent on a number of factors, particularly our ability to maintain the appropriate financial strength ratings as
assigned by independent rating agencies. Our strong capital position and global platform affords us opportunities for growth not available to smaller, less diversified, or damaged insurance companies. Refer to “Segment
Information” for competitive environment by segment.











Trademarks and Trade Names

We use various trademarks and trade
names in our business. These trademarks and trade names protect names of certain products and services we offer and are important to the extent they provide goodwill and name recognition in the insurance industry. We use commercially reasonable
efforts to protect these proprietary rights, including various trade secret and trademark laws. One or more of the trademarks and trade names could be material to our ability to sell our products and services. We have taken appropriate steps to
protect our ownership of key names and we believe it is unlikely that anyone would be able to prevent us from using names in places or circumstances material to our operations.

Insurance – North American



Overview

The Insurance – North American
segment comprises our operations in the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda. This segment, which accounted for 43 percent of our 2009 consolidated net premiums earned, includes the operations of ACE USA (including ACE Canada), ACE Westchester, ACE Bermuda,
ACE Private Risk Services, and various run-off operations:

• ACE USA, our retail operating division, provides a broad array of P&C, accident
and health (A&H), and risk management products and services to a diverse group of commercial and non-commercial enterprises and consumers. ACE USA is this segment’s largest operation and represented approximately 69 percent of Insurance
– North American’s net premiums earned in 2009.









• ACE Westchester specializes
in the North American wholesale distribution of excess and surplus P&C, environmental, professional, and inland marine products in addition to crop insurance in the U.S.

• ACE Bermuda provides commercial insurance products on an excess basis to a global client base, covering exposures that are generally low in frequency and high in severity.

• ACE Private Risk Services provides personal lines coverages (e.g. homeowners and automobile) for high net worth individuals and families in North America, as
well as provides recreational marine coverage for yachts and boats.

• The run-off operations include Brandywine Holdings Corporation (Brandywine),
Commercial Insurance Services, residual market workers’ compensation business, pools and syndicates not attributable to a single business group, and other exited lines of business. Run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but
are responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related claims.



Products and Distribution

ACE USA primarily distributes its insurance products through a limited
number of retail brokers. In addition to using brokers, certain products are also distributed through channels such as general agents, independent agents, managing general agents (MGA), managing general underwriters, alliances, affinity groups, and
direct marketing operations. These products include general liability, excess liability, property, workers’ compensation, commercial marine, automobile liability, professional lines (D&O and E&O), medical liability, aerospace, and
A&H coverages, as well as claims and risk management products and services. ACE USA has also established internet distribution channels for some of its products.

ACE USA’s on-going operations are organized into distinct business units, each offering specialized products and services targeted at specific niche markets:

• ACE Risk Management offers a wide range of customized casualty products to respond to the needs of mid-size to large companies, including national accounts,
irrespective of industry. These programs are designed to help insureds address the significant costs of financing and managing risk for workers’ compensation and general and auto liability coverages. A variety of program structures are offered
to support each client’s risk financing needs including: large deductible, captives, third-party rent-a-captives, funded deductibles, paid or incurred loss retrospective plans, and net present value and other risk financing structures,
including a prospective close-out product. We also underwrite assumed loss portfolio contracts in which insured loss events have occurred prior to the inception of the contract when the contract carries the requisite amount of insurance risk
transfer. These contracts can cause significant variances to premiums, losses and loss expenses, and expense ratios in the years in which they are written.

• ACE Global Underwriting Group, specializing in global programs and specialty coverages, provides comprehensive risk management programs and services to mid-size to large U.S.-based companies, not-for-profit, and government entities.
The group’s key products include global property, corporate risk property, inland marine, foreign casualty, commercial marine, energy, and aerospace.

• ACE Casualty Risk offers specialty casualty products to a broad range of customers, ranging from small, local businesses to the large, multinational clients. Key coverages offered by ACE Casualty Risk
include umbrella and excess liability, environmental risk for commercial and industrial risks, and wrap-up programs written on a loss-sensitive basis, protecting contractors and project sponsors with multi-risk coverage on large single- and
multi-location construction projects. Small to mid-size businesses can purchase workers’ compensation coverage through this unit’s internet-based ACE Completesmproduct.

• ACE
Professional Risk provides management liability and professional liability (D&O and E&O), as well as, surety and kidnap & extortion products that are designed to meet the needs of our insureds.

• ACE Canada (ACE USA’s Canadian operations) offers a broad range of P&C products as well as life and A&H coverage. ACE Canada specializes in
providing customized products to commercial and industrial clients as well as to groups and associations, operating nationally or internationally.

• ACE Accident & Health works with employers, travel agencies, and affinity groups to offer a variety of accident and other supplemental insurance programs. Key products include Employee Benefit Plans (basic and voluntary
accidental death and dismemberment, limited medical insurance for vision, dental and prescription drugs), occupational accident, student accident, and worldwide travel accident and global medical programs. With respect to products that include
supplemental medical and hospital indemnity coverages, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore, insulated from rising health care costs. ACE Accident & Health also provides specialty personal lines products, including
credit card enhancement programs (identity theft, rental car collision damage waiver, trip travel, and purchase protection benefits), and disaster recovery programs distributed through affinity groups.

• ACE Medical Risk offers a wide range of liability products for the healthcare industry only through licensed excess and surplus lines brokers. Products include
primary coverages for professional liability and general liability for selected types of









medical facilities, excess/umbrella liability for medical facilities, primary and excess coverages for products liability for biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, and liability
insurance for human clinical trials.

• ESIS Inc. (ESIS), ACE USA’s in-house third-party claims administrator, performs claims management and
risk control services for domestic and international organizations that self-insure P&C exposures. These services include comprehensive medical managed care, integrated disability services, and pre-loss control and risk management services.
Additional insurance-related services are offered by ESIS’s Recovery Services International, which provides salvage and subrogation and health care recovery services. ESIS’s services are available through a preferred relationship with ACE
Risk Management or separately for those clients that select insurance and claims management services independently. The operating results for ESIS are included in Insurance – North American’s administrative expenses.

ACE Westchester offers wholesale distribution of excess and surplus property, inland marine, casualty, professional lines, and environmental liability
products. Through its Program division, ACE Westchester also provides coverage for agriculture business and specialty programs, writing a variety of commercial coverages through program agents, including sports/leisure activities, farm, and
crop/hail insurance. We write crop insurance business throughout the U.S. through Rain and Hail L.L.C., an MGA. For more information, refer to “Crop Insurance”, under Item 7.

ACE Bermuda targets Fortune 1000 companies and underwrites exposures that are generally low-frequency, high-severity on an excess of loss basis. Its
principal lines of business are excess liability, professional lines, excess property, and political risk, the latter being written on a subscription basis by Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd. (Sovereign), a wholly owned managing agent. ACE Bermuda
accesses its clients primarily through the Bermuda offices of major, internationally recognized insurance brokers.

ACE Private Risk
Services provides specialty coverages including homeowners, automobile, valuables, umbrella liability, and recreational marine insurance for affluent individuals and families in North America. ACE Private Risk Services’ products are distributed
through independent regional agents and brokers.



Competitive
Environment

ACE USA and ACE Westchester compete against a number of large, national carriers as well as regional competitors in certain
territories. The markets in which they compete are subject to significant cycles of fluctuating capacity and wide disparities in price adequacy. We strive to offer superior service, which we believe has differentiated us from our competitors. The
ACE USA and ACE Westchester operations pursue a specialist strategy and focus on market opportunities where we can compete effectively based on service levels and product design, while still achieving an adequate level of profitability. A
competitive advantage is also achieved through ACE USA’s innovative product offerings and our ability to provide multiple products to a single client due to our nationwide local presence. An additional competitive strength of all our domestic
commercial units is the ability to deliver global products and coverage to customers in concert with our Insurance – Overseas General segment. ACE USA has grown, in part, from the leveraging of cross-marketing opportunities with our other
operations to take advantage of our organization’s global presence. ACE Bermuda competes against international commercial carriers writing business on an excess of loss basis. ACE Private Risk Services competes against insurance companies of
varying sizes that sell products through various distribution channels, including through the Internet.



Insurance – Overseas General



Overview

The Insurance – Overseas General segment, which accounted for 39 percent of 2009 consolidated net premiums
earned, writes a variety of insurance coverage including P&C, professional lines, marine, energy, aviation, political risk, specialty consumer-oriented products, and A&H. Insurance – Overseas General comprises ACE International, our
retail business serving territories outside the U.S., Bermuda, and Canada; the international A&H and life business of Combined Insurance; and the wholesale insurance business of ACE Global Markets, our London-based excess and surplus lines
business that includes Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488 (Syndicate 2488). The reinsurance operation of ACE Global Markets is included in the Global Reinsurance segment. ACE provides funds at Lloyd’s to support underwriting by Syndicate 2488, which
is managed by ACE Underwriting Agencies Limited and has an underwriting capacity of £400 million for 2010.



Products and Distribution

ACE International
maintains a presence in every major insurance market in the world and is organized geographically along product lines that provide dedicated underwriting focus to customers. ACE International’s P&C business is generally written, on both a
direct and assumed basis, through major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. A&H and other









consumer lines products are distributed through brokers, agents, direct marketing programs, and sponsor relationships. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as
well as energy industry-related, construction, and other technical coverages. Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, and general liability. ACE International also provides D&O, and professional
indemnity coverages. Marine cargo and hull coverages are written in the London market as well as in marine markets throughout the world. The A&H operations design products to meet the insurance needs of individuals and groups outside of U.S.
insurance markets. These products have represented an increasing portion of ACE International’s business in recent years and include, but are not limited to, accidental death, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection
coverages. We are not in the primary health care business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore, insulated from rising health care costs. ACE
International’s personal lines operations provide specialty products and services designed to meet the needs of specific target markets and include, but are not limited to, property damage, auto, homeowners, and personal liability.

The following is a discussion of Insurance – Overseas General’s five areas of operations: ACE European Group (which is comprised of ACE
Europe and ACE Global Markets branded business), ACE Asia Pacific, ACE Far East, ACE Latin America, and Combined Insurance.

• ACE Asia Pacific is headquartered in Singapore and has an
extensive network of operations serving Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Macau, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. ACE Asia Pacific offers a broad range of P&C, A&H, and specialty
coverages principally directed at large and mid-sized corporations as well as individual consumers. This region also provides management, underwriting, reinsurance protection and administrative support to our equity investee, Huatai Insurance
Company of China, Limited.

• ACE Far East is based in Tokyo and offers a broad range of P&C, A&H, and personal lines insurance products and
services to businesses and consumers in Japan, principally delivered through an extensive agency network.

• ACE Latin America includes business
operations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, including offices in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Puerto Rico. ACE Latin America focuses on providing P&C, A&H, and specialty personal lines
insurance products and services to both large and small commercial clients as well as individual consumers. ACE Latin America distributes its products through brokers (for its commercial business) and direct marketing and sponsored programs (for its
consumer business).

• Combined Insurance uses an international sales force of approximately 3,300 independent contractor agents to distribute a
wide range of supplemental accident and health products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical conditions and cancer aid, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations and
are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.



Competitive Environment

ACE International’s primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations,
as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets. For the A&H lines of business, including those offered by Combined Insurance, locally-based competitors include financial institutions and bank-owned
insurance subsidiaries. Our









international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally
admitted basis. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services.
A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also giving us the advantage of
accessing local technical expertise, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multi-national accounts.

ACE Global Markets is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks underwritten for all lines of business. This leadership position allows ACE
Global Markets to set the policy terms and conditions of many of the policies written. All lines of business face competition, depending on the business class, from Lloyd’s syndicates, the London market, and other major international insurers
and reinsurers. Competition for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. ACE Global Markets differentiates itself from competitors through long standing experience in its product lines, its
multiple insurance entities (Syndicate 2488 and AEGL), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.



Global Reinsurance



Overview

The Global Reinsurance segment, which accounted for seven percent of 2009 consolidated net premiums earned,
represents ACE’s reinsurance operations comprising ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re Europe, and ACE Tempest Re Canada. Global Reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide under the ACE Tempest Re brand name
and provides a broad range of coverages to a diverse array of primary P&C insurers. The Global Reinsurance segment also includes the reinsurance operations of ACE Global Markets.



Products and Distribution

Global Reinsurance services clients globally through all of its major units. Major international brokers submit business to one or more of these units’ underwriting teams who have built strong relationships with both key brokers and
clients by providing a responsive, client-focused approach to risk assessment and pricing.

ACE Tempest Re Bermuda principally provides
property catastrophe reinsurance, on an excess of loss per occurrence basis globally to insurers of commercial and personal property. Property catastrophe reinsurance on an occurrence basis protects a ceding company against an accumulation of losses
covered by its issued insurance policies, arising from a common event or occurrence. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda underwrites reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis, meaning that its exposure only arises after the ceding company’s
accumulated losses have exceeded the attachment point of the reinsurance policy. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for selected clients. Examples include proportional property (the reinsurer shares a
proportional part of the premiums and losses of the ceding company) and per risk excess of loss treaty reinsurance (coverage applies on a per risk basis rather than per event or aggregate basis), together with casualty and specialty lines
(catastrophe workers’ compensation and terrorism). ACE Tempest Re Bermuda’s business is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.

ACE Tempest Re USA writes all lines of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance for the North American market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance, including medical
malpractice, auto, and professional lines. This unit’s diversified portfolio is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.

ACE
Tempest Re Europe provides treaty reinsurance of P&C business of insurance companies worldwide, with emphasis on non-U.S. and London market risks. ACE Tempest Re Europe writes all lines of traditional and specialty reinsurance including
property, casualty, marine, motor, aviation, and medical malpractice through our London- and Zurich-based divisions. The London-based divisions of ACE Tempest Re Europe focus on the development of business sourced through London market brokers and,
consequently, write a diverse book of international business utilizing Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488 and AEGL. The Zurich-based division focuses on providing reinsurance to continental European insurers via continental European brokers. ACE Tempest Re
Europe also includes our Shanghai office which provides reinsurance coverage for Chinese-based risks and our new Sao Paulo, Brazil office which provides reinsurance for Brazilian-based risks.

ACE Tempest Re Canada offers a full array of P&C reinsurance to the Canadian market. ACE Tempest Re Canada provides its coverage through its
Canadian company platform and also offers its clients access to Lloyd’s Syndicate 2488.









Competitive Environment

The Global Reinsurance segment competes worldwide with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous
multi-line insurance organizations. Global Reinsurance is considered a lead reinsurer and is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global
Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of its strong capital position, the quality of service provided to customers, the leading role it plays in setting the terms, pricing, and conditions in negotiating contracts, and
its customized approach to risk selection. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line. Further, over the last several years, capital markets participants have developed financial products intended to compete with
traditional reinsurance. In addition, government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for reinsurance.



Life



Overview



Products and Distribution

ACE Life offers a broad portfolio of protection and savings products including whole life, endowment plans, individual term life, group term life, group medical, personal accident, universal life, and unit linked contracts. The policies
written by ACE Life generally provide funds to beneficiaries of insureds after death and/or protection and/or savings benefits while the contract owner is living. ACE Life sells to consumers through a variety of distribution channels including
agency, bancassurance, brokers, and telemarketing. We continue to expand this business with a focus on opportunities in emerging markets that we believe will result in strong and sustainable operating profits as well as favorable return on capital
commitments after an initial growth period.

Our dedicated agency distribution channel, whereby agents sell ACE Life products
exclusively, enables us to maintain direct contact with the individual consumer, promote quality sales practices, and exercise greater control over the future of the business. ACE Life is developing agency distribution in those countries in which we
believe we can achieve sustainable growth as well as a favorable return on our investment. As of December 31, 2009, ACE Life, excluding China, has developed a sales force of over 9,000 agents principally located in Asia-Pacific countries,
including a leadership position in Vietnam and growing agency forces in Indonesia and Thailand. ACE Life manages its agency business through key performance indicators, among other things, that monitor the retention and productivity of its agents
and persistency of our business.

ACE maintains approximately 37 percent direct and indirect ownership interest in Huatai Life Insurance
Co., Ltd. (“Huatai Life”), which commenced operations in 2005. Huatai Life offers a broad portfolio of insurance products through a variety of distribution channels in eight provinces within China. Based on 2009 premium volume as defined
by China regulations, which include investment deposits, Huatai Life was ranked among the top 15 of 50 life insurers in China and the third largest foreign invested life insurer. Huatai Life has developed a sales force of approximately 19,000 agents
as of December 31, 2009, and maintains distribution agreements with many large banks within China.

Since 2007, ACE Life Re has not
quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace. A significant percentage of our total revenue and income/losses in Bermuda derives from our core line of business, which is the reinsurance of variable annuity guarantees,
including both death and living benefit guarantees. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term earnings volatility is expected. Our primary focus in the Bermuda operation is to successfully manage the current portfolio of
risk in the variable annuity line of business.









Combined Insurance uses a
North American sales force of over 2,000 agents to distribute a wide range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital
confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.



Competitive Environment

ACE Life’s
competition differs by location but generally includes multi-national insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. ACE’s financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a
global presence give ACE Life a strong base from which to compete. While ACE Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. ACE Life Re has
written traditional mortality reinsurance from both its Bermuda and U.S. companies. The life reinsurance market for traditional mortality risk is highly competitive as most of the reinsurance companies are well established, have significant
operating histories, strong claims-paying ability ratings, and long-standing client relationships through existing treaties with ceding companies.

Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.



Underwriting

ACE is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to
employ consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection in order to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines are in place in each of our local operations
and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of
experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and conservative use of policy limits and terms and conditions.

Qualified actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use
sophisticated catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques designed to ensure appropriate spread of risk and to analyze correlation of risk across different product lines and territories. This helps to ensure that losses are contained within our
risk tolerance and appetite for individual products lines, businesses, and ACE as a whole. We also purchase reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks, refer to
“Reinsurance Protection”. For more information refer to “Insurance and Reinsurance Markets”, under Item 1A, “Catastrophe Exposure Management” and “Natural Catastrophe Reinsurance Program”, under
Item 7, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Reinsurance Protection

A separate policy and process exists for captive reinsurance companies. Generally, these reinsurance companies are established by our clients or our clients have an interest in them. It is generally our policy to
obtain collateral equal to the expected losses that may be ceded to the captive. Where appropriate, exceptions to the collateral requirement are granted but only after senior management review. Specific collateral guidelines and an exception process
are in place for ACE USA and Insurance – Overseas General, both of which have credit management units evaluating the captive’s credit quality and that of









their parent company. The credit management units, working with actuarial, determine reasonable exposure estimates (collateral calculations), ensure receipt of collateral in a form
acceptable to the Company, and coordinate collateral adjustments as and when needed. Currently, financial reviews and expected loss evaluations are performed annually for active captive accounts and as needed for run-off exposures. In addition
to collateral, parental guarantees are often used to enhance the credit quality of the captive.

In general, we seek to place our
reinsurance with highly rated companies with which we have a strong trading relationship. For more information refer to “Catastrophe Exposure Management” and “Natural Catastrophe Reinsurance Program”, under Item 7, and Note
5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses

During the loss settlement period, which can be many years in duration, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often
will become known. As these become apparent, case reserves may be adjusted by allocation from IBNR without any change in the overall reserve. In addition, the circumstances of individual claims or the application of statistical and actuarial methods
to loss experience data may lead to the adjustment of the overall reserves upward or downward from time to time. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses may be significantly greater than or less than reported loss and loss expense reserves.

We have considered asbestos and environmental (A&E) claims and claims expenses in establishing the liability for unpaid losses and
loss expenses and have developed reserving methods which consider historical experience as well as incorporate new sources of data to estimate the ultimate losses arising from A&E exposures. The reserves for A&E claims and claims expenses
represent management’s best estimate of future loss and loss expense payments and recoveries that are expected to develop over the next several decades. We continuously monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and latent injury
claims, we monitor A&E claims activity quarterly, and we perform a full reserve review annually.

For each product line, management,
in conjunction with internal actuaries, develops a “best estimate” of the ultimate settlement value of the unpaid losses and loss expenses that it believes provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. We evaluate our estimates
of reserves quarterly in light of developing information. While we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves may be necessary in the future, we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are adequate at
December 31, 2009. Future additions to reserves, if needed, could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

For more information refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates—Unpaid losses and loss expenses”, under Item 7 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.

The “Analysis of Losses and Loss Expenses Development” table shown below presents, for each balance sheet date over the period 1999-2009, the
gross and net loss and loss expense reserves recorded at the balance sheet date and subsequent net payments on the associated liabilities. The reserves represent the amount required for the estimated future settlement value of liabilities incurred
at or prior to the balance sheet date and those estimates may change subsequent to the balance sheet date as new information emerges regarding the ultimate settlement value of the liability. Accordingly, the table also presents through
December 31, 2009, for each balance sheet date, the cumulative impact of subsequent valuations of the liabilities incurred at the original balance sheet date. The data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the









SEC. This table should be interpreted with care by those not familiar with its format or those who are familiar with other triangulations arranged by origin year of loss such as accident or
underwriting year rather than balance sheet date, as shown below. To clarify the interpretation of the table, we use the reserves established at December 31, 1999, in the following example.

The top two lines of the table show, for successive balance sheet dates, the gross and net unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded as provision for
liabilities incurred at or prior to each balance sheet date. It can be seen that at December 31, 1999, a reserve of $9.244 billion net of reinsurance had been established.

The upper (paid) triangulation presents the net amounts paid as of periods subsequent to the balance sheet date. Hence in the 2000 financial year,
$2.717 billion of payments were made on liabilities contemplated in the December 31, 1999, reserve balance. At the end of the 2009 financial year, there were cumulative net payments of $7.671 billion on this block of liabilities.

The lower triangulation within the table shows the revised estimate of the net liability originally recorded at each balance sheet date as of the end
of subsequent financial years. With the benefit of actual loss emergence and hindsight over the intervening period, the net liabilities incurred as of December 31, 1999, are now estimated to be $10.909 billion, rather than the original estimate
of $9.244 billion. One of the key drivers of this change has been adverse development on latent claims that we categorize as A&E covered under the National Indemnity Company (NICO) reinsurance treaties. Of the cumulative deficiency of $1.665
billion recognized in the ten years since December 31, 1999, $464 million relates to non-latent claims and $1.201 billion relates to latent claims. The deficiency of $1.665 billion was identified and recorded as follows; $16 million redundant
in 2000, $4 million deficient in 2001, $526 million deficient in 2002, $155 million deficient in 2003, $875 million deficient in 2004, $120 million redundant in 2005, $41 million deficient in 2006, $28 million redundant in 2007, $108 million
deficient in 2008, and $120 million deficient in 2009.

Importantly, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for different balance sheet
dates are not independent and, therefore, should not be added together. In the last year, we revised our estimate of the December 31, 1999, liabilities from $10.789 billion to $10.909 billion. This adverse development of $120 million will also
be included in each column to the right of the December 31, 1999, column to recognize that this additional amount was also required in the reserves established for each annual balance sheet date from December 31, 2000, to December 31,
2009.

The loss development table shows that our original estimate of the net unpaid loss and loss expense requirement at
December 31, 2008, of $24.241 billion has, with the benefit of actual loss emergence and hindsight, been revised to $23.653 billion at December 31, 2009. This favorable movement of $588 million is referred to as prior period development
and is the net result of a number of underlying movements both favorable and adverse. (See note 3 to table below). The key underlying movements are discussed in more detail within the “Prior Period Development” section of Item 7.

The bottom lines of the table show the re-estimated amount of previously recorded gross liabilities at December 31, 2009, together
with the change in reinsurance recoverable. Similar to the net liabilities, the cumulative redundancy or deficiency on the gross liability is the difference between the gross liability originally recorded and the re-estimated gross liability at
December 31, 2009. For example, with respect to the gross unpaid loss and loss expenses of $16.713 billion for December 31, 1999, this gross liability was re-estimated to be $23.274 billion at December 31, 2009, resulting in the
cumulative deficiency on the gross liability originally recorded for the 1999 balance sheet year of $6.561 billion. This deficiency relates primarily to U.S. liabilities, including A&E liabilities for 1995 and prior. The gross deficiency results
in a net deficiency of $1.665 billion after consideration of substantial reinsurance coverage that reduces the gross loss; approximately $2.2 billion was covered by reinsurance placed when the risks were originally written and $1.25 billion of the
remaining liability has been ceded to NICO.

We do not consider it appropriate to extrapolate future deficiencies or redundancies based
upon the table, as conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily recur in the future. We believe that our current estimates of net liabilities appropriately reflect our current knowledge
of the business profile and the prevailing market, social, legal, and economic conditions while giving due consideration to historical trends and volatility evidenced in our markets over the longer term. The key issues and considerations
involved in establishing our estimate of the net liabilities are discussed in more detail within the “Critical Accounting Estimates—Unpaid losses and loss expenses” section of Item 7.

On July 2, 1999, we changed our fiscal year-end from September 30 to December 31. As a result, the information provided for the 1999
year is actually for the 15-month period from October 1, 1998, through December 31, 1999. On July 2, 1999, we acquired ACE INA (CIGNA’s P&C business) and on April 1, 2008, we acquired Combined Insurance. The unpaid loss
information has been included in the table commencing in the year of acquisition. As a result, 1999 includes net reserves of $6.8 billion related to ACE INA at the date of acquisition and subsequent development thereon.

Investments

Our principal investment objective is to ensure that funds will be available to meet our primary insurance and reinsurance obligations. Within this broad liquidity
constraint, the investment portfolio’s structure seeks to maximize return subject to specifically-approved guidelines of overall asset classes, credit quality, liquidity, and volatility of expected returns. As such, our investment portfolio is
invested primarily in investment-grade fixed-income securities as measured by the major rating agencies.

The management of our
investment portfolio is the responsibility of ACE Asset Management, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ACE. ACE Asset Management operates principally to guide and direct our investment process. In this regard, ACE Asset Management:

• conducts formal asset allocation modeling for each of the ACE subsidiaries, providing formal recommendations for the portfolio’s structure;

• establishes recommended investment guidelines that are appropriate to the prescribed asset allocation targets;

• provides the analysis, evaluation, and selection of our external investment advisors;

• establishes and develops investment-related analytics to enhance portfolio engineering and risk control;

• monitors and aggregates the correlated risk of the overall investment portfolio; and

• provides governance over the investment
process for each of our operating companies to ensure consistency of approach and adherence to investment guidelines.

For the portfolio,
we determine allowable, targeted asset allocation and ranges for each of the operating segments. These asset allocation targets are derived from sophisticated asset and liability modeling that measures correlated histories of returns and volatility
of returns. Allowable investment classes are further refined through analysis of our operating environment, including expected volatility of cash flows, overall capital position, regulatory, and rating agency considerations.









The Finance and
Investment Committee of the Board approves asset allocation targets and reviews our investment policy to ensure that it is consistent with our overall goals, strategies, and objectives. Overall investment guidelines are reviewed and approved by the
Finance and Investment Committee to ensure that appropriate levels of portfolio liquidity, credit quality, diversification, and volatility are maintained. In addition, the Finance and Investment Committee systematically reviews the portfolio’s
exposures including any potential violations of investment guidelines. We have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization. Exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our Global Credit
Committee, comprised of senior executives, including our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Investment Officer, and our Treasurer. Additionally, the Board has established a Risk Committee which helps execute the Board’s
supervisory responsibilities pertaining to enterprise risk management including investment risk.

Within the guidelines and asset
allocation parameters established by the Finance and Investment Committee, individual investment committees of the operating segments determine tactical asset allocation. Additionally, these committees review all investment-related activity that
affects their operating company, including the selection of outside investment advisors, proposed asset allocations changes, and the systematic review of investment guidelines.

For additional information regarding the investment portfolio, including breakdowns of the sector and maturity distributions, refer to Note 4 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Regulation

Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally, including in all 50 states of the United States and the
District of Columbia. Our businesses in each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require
among other things that these subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus and liquidity, meet solvency standards, and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition. The complex regulatory environments in which
ACE operates are subject to change and are regularly monitored. The following is an overview discussion of regulations for our operations in Switzerland, the U.S., Bermuda, and other international locations.



Swiss Operations

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, which we refer to as “FINMA” has the discretion to supervise our group activities. Under so-called “group supervision,” FINMA has the right to
supervise the Company on a group-wide basis. The regulatory power of FINMA covers in particular the following areas:

• reporting on organization;

• reporting on structure;

• reporting on
internal transactions;

• solvency;

•
group/conglomerate report; and

• corporate governance/risk management/internal control system.

In 2008, we received written confirmation from the Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI), a FINMA predecessor insurance supervising authority,
that it does not intend to subject us to group supervision so long as certain business parameters within Switzerland are not exceeded. While we currently intend to operate within these parameters, we cannot assure you that our future business needs
may not require that we exceed these parameters or that FINMA will not change these parameters or otherwise determine to exercise group supervision over us. The costs and administrative burdens of group supervision could be substantial. Late in
2008, we formed ACE Insurance (Switzerland) Limited which offers various insurance covers to small and mid-sized Swiss companies, as well as A&H solutions to individuals. We have also formed a reinsurance subsidiary named ACE Reinsurance
(Switzerland) Limited which we operate as primarily a provider of reinsurance to other ACE entities. Both new companies are licensed and governed by FINMA.



U.S. Operations

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to
extensive regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish departments of insurance with broad authority to regulate, among other things: the standards of solvency that must be met and
maintained, the licensing of insurers and their producers, approval of policy forms and rates, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of the risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for
the benefit of policyholders, requirements for the acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and the adequacy of reserves
for unearned premiums, losses, and other purposes.









Our U.S. insurance
subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and quarterly reports with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do business. In addition, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ operations and financial records are subject
to examination at regular intervals by state regulators.

All states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding companies.
This legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that
may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a holding company system must be fair and equitable. Notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the
consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and an entity in its holding company system; in addition, certain transactions may not be consummated without the
department’s prior approval.

Statutory surplus is an important measure utilized by the regulators and rating agencies to assess our
U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ ability to support business operations and provide dividend capacity. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be
paid without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on calculations incorporating statutory surplus, statutory net income, and/or investment income.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has a risk-based capital requirement for P&C insurance companies. This risk-based
capital formula is used by many state regulatory authorities to identify insurance companies that may be undercapitalized and which merit further regulatory attention. These requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy using a formula that
prescribes a series of risk measurements to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company, based on the profile of the individual company. The ratio of a company’s actual policyholder surplus to its minimum capital requirement
will determine whether any state regulatory action is required. There are progressive risk-based capital failure levels that trigger more stringent regulatory action. If an insurer’s policyholders’ surplus falls below the Mandatory Control
Level (70 percent of the Authorized Control Level, as defined by the NAIC), the relevant insurance commissioner is required to place the insurer under regulatory control. However, an insurance commissioner may allow a P&C company operating below
the Mandatory Control Level that is writing no business and is running off its existing business to continue its run-off. Brandywine is running off its liabilities consistent with the terms of an order issued by the Insurance Commissioner of
Pennsylvania. This includes periodic reporting obligations to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.

Government intervention has also
occurred in the insurance and reinsurance markets in relation to terrorism coverage in the U.S. (and through industry initiatives in other countries). The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability
of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S., was extended in 2007 for seven years, through 2014, and applies to certain of our operations.

From time to time, ACE and its subsidiaries and affiliates receive inquiries from state agencies and attorneys general, with which we generally comply, seeking information concerning business practices, such as
underwriting and non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. Moreover, many recent factors, such as consequences of and reactions to industry and economic conditions as well as a change in the presidential administration and focus on
domestic issues, have contributed to the potential for change in the legal and regulatory framework applicable to ACE’s U.S. operations and businesses. We cannot assure you that changes in laws or investigative or enforcement activities in the
various U.S states will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results, or business practices. More information on insurance industry investigations, including settlement agreements and related matters, is set forth in Note
10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Bermuda
Operations

In Bermuda, our insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the
Act). The Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the Authority) powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies.
Significant requirements include the appointment of an independent auditor, the appointment of a loss reserve specialist, and the filing of the Annual Statutory Financial Return with the Executive Member responsible for Insurance (the Executive). We
must comply with provisions of the Companies Act 1981 regulating the payment of dividends and distributions. A Bermuda company may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution out of contributed surplus if there are reasonable grounds for
believing that: (a) the company is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due; or (b) the realizable value of the company’s assets would thereby be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and
its issued share capital and share premium accounts. Further, an insurer may not declare or pay any dividends during any financial year if it would cause the insurer to fail to meet its relevant margins, and an insurer which fails to meet its
relevant









margins on the last day of any financial year may not, without the approval of the Minister of Finance, declare or pay any dividends during the next financial year. In addition, some of
ACE’s Bermuda subsidiaries qualify as “Class 4” insurers and may not in any financial year pay dividends which would exceed 25 percent of their total statutory capital and surplus, as shown on their statutory balance sheet in relation
to the previous financial year, unless they file a solvency affidavit at least seven days in advance.

The Executive may appoint an
inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if he or she believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurer’s policyholders or persons who may become policyholders. If it appears to the
Executive that there is a risk of the insurer becoming insolvent, or that the insurer is in breach of the Act or any conditions of its registration under the Act, the Executive may direct the insurer not to take on any new insurance business, not to
vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurer’s liabilities, not to make certain investments, to realize certain investments, to maintain in, or transfer to the custody of a specified bank certain assets, not to
declare or pay any dividends or other distributions, or to restrict the making of such payments and/or to limit its premium income.

The
Act also requires the Authority to supervise persons carrying on insurance business, insurance managers, and intermediaries with the aim of protecting the interests of clients and potential clients of such persons. The Act requires every insurer to
appoint a principal representative resident in Bermuda and to maintain a principal office in Bermuda. The principal representative must be knowledgeable in insurance and is responsible for arranging the maintenance and custody of the statutory
accounting records and for filing the annual Statutory Financial Return.



Other International Operations

The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which the non-U.S. ACE
operations conduct business. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example:

• in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports;

• some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the
insurer and the customer;

• the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of foreign reinsurance vary;

• policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;

•
the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; and

• regulatory requirements relating to
insurer dividend policies vary by country.

Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local
regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.

ACE operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of those subsidiaries. Local capital requirements applicable to a subsidiary generally include its branches. Certain ACE
companies are jointly owned with local companies to comply with legal requirements for local ownership. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, local retention of funds and records,
data privacy and protection program requirements, and foreign exchange controls. ACE’s international companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.

Moreover, there are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact ACE in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant
impact on ACE could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. In particular, the European Union’s (EU) executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations
for the European insurance industry, known as Solvency II, which aims to establish a revised set of EU-wide capital requirements and risk management standards that will replace the current Solvency I requirements. Once finalized, Solvency II is
expected to set out new, strengthened requirements applicable to the entire EU relating to capital adequacy and risk management for insurers. Other jurisdictions such as Bermuda and Switzerland are likely to strengthen their respective capital and
risk management requirements.



Enterprise
Risk Management

As an insurer, ACE is in the business of risk management for profit. As a result, enterprise risk management, or ERM, is a part of
the day-to-day management of the Company and its operations. Because risk management must permeate an organization conducting insurance businesses around the world, we have established an ERM process that is integrated into management of our
businesses and is led by ACE’s senior management.









Our global ERM framework is broadly
multi-disciplinary and its objectives include:

• support core risk management responsibilities at division and corporate levels through the
identification and management of risks that aggregate and/or correlate across divisions;

• identify, analyze, and mitigate significant external
risks that could impair the financial condition of ACE and/or hinder its business objectives;

• coordinate accumulation guidelines and actual
exposure relative to guidelines, risk codes, and other risk processes;

• provide analysis and maintain accumulation and economic capital and
information systems that enable business leaders to make appropriate and consistent risk/return decisions;

• identify and assess emerging risk
issues; and

• develop and communicate to the Company’s business lines consistent risk management processes.

The Company’s Enterprise Risk Management Board (ERMB) reports to and assists the Chief Executive Officer in the oversight and review of ACE’s
ERM framework. The ERMB is chaired by the Company’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. The ERMB oversees and monitors the processes and guidelines used to manage insurance risk, financial risk, strategic risk, and operational risk. The ERMB
governance framework relies in part on establishment and maintenance of risk limits and a risk matrix through which inherent and residual risks across the organization are cataloged. The ERMB meets at least monthly, and is comprised of the
Company’s most senior executives, in addition to the Chair: the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Claims Officer, General Counsel, Chief Executive Officer for Insurance – North America, Chief
Executive Officer for ACE Overseas General, and our Assumed Reinsurance Officer.

The ERMB is provided support from various sources,
including the Enterprise Risk Unit (ERU) and Product Boards. The ERU is responsible for the collation and analysis of two types of information. First, external information that provides insight to the ERMB on risks that might imperil ACE’s key
objectives and second, internal information on single named, product, and cross-product accumulations. The ERU is independent of the operating units and reports to our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. The Product Boards exist to provide
oversight for products that the Company offers globally. A Product Board currently exists for each of the following products; property/energy, marine, casualty, financial lines, aviation, and political risk. Each Product Board is responsible for
ensuring consistency in underwriting and pricing standards, identification of emerging issues, and single name accumulation guidelines.

The Company’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary also reports to the Board’s Risk Committee, which helps execute the Board’s supervisory responsibilities pertaining to ERM. The role of the Risk Committee includes evaluation
of the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’s ERM procedures and systems and information; oversight of policy decisions pertaining to risk aggregation and minimization, including credit risk; and assessment of the Company’s major
decisions and preparedness levels pertaining to perceived material risks. The Audit Committee, which regularly meets jointly with the Risk Committee, provides oversight of the financial reporting process and safeguarding of assets.

Others within the ERM structure contribute toward accomplishing ACE’s ERM objectives, including regional management, Internal Audit, Compliance,
external consultants, and managers of our internal control processes and procedures.
