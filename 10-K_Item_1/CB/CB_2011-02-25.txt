General Development of Business

ACE Limited is the
Swiss-incorporated holding company of the ACE Group of Companies. ACE opened its business office in Bermuda in 1985 and continues to maintain operations in Bermuda. ACE Limited, which is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, and its direct and
indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the ACE Group of Companies, ACE, the Company, we, us, or our) is a global insurance and reinsurance organization, serving the needs of commercial and individual customers in more than 170 countries. We serve
the P&C insurance and reinsurance needs of businesses of all sizes in a broad range of industries. We also provide specialized insurance products: such as personal accident, supplemental health, and life insurance to individuals in select
countries. At December 31, 2010, ACE had total assets of $83 billion and shareholders’ equity of $23 billion.

We have grown
our business through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisition of other companies.

On December 28, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. (Rain and Hail) not previously
owned by us for approximately $1.1 billion in cash. Prior to this transaction, ACE owned approximately 20 percent of the outstanding common stock of Rain and Hail. Headquartered in Johnston, Iowa, Rain and Hail has served America’s farmers
since 1919, providing comprehensive multiple peril crop and crop/hail insurance protection to customers in the U.S. and Canada. We intend to operate Rain and Hail as a unit of our ACE Westchester division in the Insurance-North American segment.

On December 1, 2010, we acquired 100 percent of Jerneh Insurance Berhad, a general insurance company in Malaysia that had been
majority owned by Jerneh Asia Berhad, an investment holding company listed on Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad. The acquisition price was approximately $218 million in cash.

On October 26, 2010, we announced that we had signed a definitive purchase agreement (the purchase agreement) to acquire New York Life’s
Hong Kong and Korea life insurance operations for approximately $425 million in cash. The purchase agreement with New York Life was amended to allow for separate closings for the Hong Kong and Korea operations. On February 1, 2011, we acquired
New York Life’s Korea operations for approximately $75 million in cash. The Hong Kong portion of the transaction is currently expected to close early in 2011.



Employees

At December 31, 2010, there were approximately 16,000 employees in the ACE Group of Companies. We believe that employee relations are satisfactory.



Customers

For most of the commercial lines of business that we offer, insureds typically use the services of an insurance broker or agent. An insurance broker acts as an
agent for the insureds, offering advice on the types and amount of insurance to purchase and also assisting in the negotiation of price and terms and conditions. We obtain business from the local and major international insurance brokers and
typically pay a commission to brokers for any business accepted and bound. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material adverse effect on our business. In our opinion, no
material part of our business is dependent upon a single insured or group of insureds. We do not believe that the loss of any one insured would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and no one insured or
group of affiliated insureds account for as much as 10 percent of our consolidated revenues.



Competition

Competition in the insurance and reinsurance
marketplace is substantial. Competition varies by type of business and geographic area. Competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups (such as group captives and catastrophe pools), and other
underwriting organizations. These companies sell through various distribution channels and business models, across a broad array of product lines, and with a high level of variation regarding geographic, marketing, and customer segmentation. We
compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service. Our ability to compete is dependent on a number of factors, particularly our ability to maintain
the appropriate financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies. Our strong capital position and global platform affords us opportunities for growth not available to smaller, less diversified insurance
companies. Refer to “Segment Information” for competitive environment by segment.









Trademarks and Trade Names

We use various trademarks and
trade names in our business. These trademarks and trade names protect names of certain products and services we offer and are important to the extent they provide goodwill and name recognition in the insurance industry. We use commercially
reasonable efforts to protect these proprietary rights, including various trade secret and trademark laws. One or more of the trademarks and trade names could be material to our ability to sell our products and services. We have taken appropriate
steps to protect our ownership of key names and we believe it is unlikely that anyone would be able to prevent us from using names in places or circumstances material to our operations.

Insurance – North American



Overview

The Insurance – North American
segment comprises our operations in the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda. This segment, which accounted for 42 percent of our 2010 consolidated net premiums earned, includes the operations of ACE USA (including ACE Canada), ACE Westchester, ACE Bermuda,
ACE Private Risk Services, and various run-off operations.







Products and Distribution

ACE USA, our retail operating division in North America, provides a broad array of P&C, accident and health (A&H), and risk management products and services to a diverse group of North American commercial
and non commercial enterprises and consumers. ACE USA is this segment’s largest operation and represented approximately 70 percent of Insurance – North American’s net premiums earned in 2010. ACE USA distributes its insurance products
primarily through a limited number of retail brokers. In addition to using brokers, certain products are also distributed through general agents, independent agents, managing general agents (MGA), managing general underwriters, alliances, affinity
groups, and direct marketing operations. Products offered include general liability, excess liability, property, workers’ compensation, commercial marine, automobile liability, professional lines (D&O and E&O), medical liability,
aerospace, and A&H coverages, as well as claims and risk management products and services. ACE USA has also established internet distribution channels for some of its products.

ACE USA’s on-going operations are organized into distinct business units, each offering specialized products and services targeted at specific
niche markets:

• ACE Risk Management offers a wide range of customized casualty products to respond to the needs of mid-size to large companies,
including national accounts, irrespective of industry. These programs are designed to help insureds address the significant costs of financing and managing risk for workers’ compensation and general and auto liability coverages. A variety of
program structures are offered to support each client’s risk financing needs including: large deductible, captives, third-party rent-a-captives, funded deductibles, paid or incurred loss retrospective plans, and net present value and other risk
financing structures, including a prospective close-out product. We also underwrite assumed loss portfolio contracts in which insured loss events have occurred prior to the inception of the contract, when the contract carries the requisite amount of
insurance risk transfer. These contracts can cause significant variances to premiums, losses and loss expenses, and expense ratios in the periods in which they are written.

• ACE Global Underwriting Group is comprised of property and specialty operations and foreign casualty, providing comprehensive risk management programs and services to mid-size to large U.S.-based companies,
not-for-profit, and government entities. The group’s key products include global property, corporate risk property, inland marine, foreign casualty, commercial marine, aerospace, and energy.

• ACE Casualty Risk offers specialty casualty products to a broad range of customers, ranging from small, local businesses to large,
multinational clients. Key coverages offered by ACE Casualty Risk include umbrella and excess liability, environmental risk for commercial and industrial risks, and wrap-up programs written on a loss sensitive basis, protecting contractors and
project sponsors with multi-risk coverage on large single- and multi-location construction projects. We also write custom casualty products for specialized industry segments and unique risks as well as products which address the needs of public
entities such as educational institutions. On a selected basis, workers’ compensation coverage is available to small to mid-size businesses.

•
ACE Professional Risk provides management liability and professional liability (D&O and E&O) as well as surety and kidnap & extortion products to middle market and Fortune 1000 clients.

• ACE Canada (ACE USA’s Canadian operations) offers a broad range of P&C products as well as life and A&H coverage. ACE Canada specializes in
providing customized products to commercial and industrial clients as well as to groups and associations, operating nationally or internationally.

• ACE Accident & Health works with employers, travel agencies, and affinity groups to offer a variety of accident and other supplemental insurance
programs. Key products include employee benefit plans, occupational accident, student accident, and worldwide travel accident and global medical programs. With respect to products that include supplemental medical and hospital indemnity coverages,
we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore, insulated from rising health care costs. ACE Accident & Health also provides specialty personal lines products, including credit card enhancement programs (identity theft, rental
car collision damage waiver, trip travel, and purchase protection benefits), and disaster recovery programs distributed through affinity groups.

•
ACE Medical Risk offers a wide range of liability products for the health care industry only through licensed excess and surplus lines brokers. Products include primary coverages for professional liability and general liability for selected types of
medical facilities, excess/umbrella liability for medical facilities, primary and excess coverages for products liability for biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, and liability insurance for human clinical trials.

• ESIS Inc. (ESIS), ACE USA’s in-house third-party claims administrator, performs claims management and risk control services for domestic and
international organizations, including for the Insurance – North American segment. These services include comprehensive medical managed care, integrated disability services, and pre-loss control and risk management services. Additional
insurance-related services are offered by ESIS’s Recovery Services International, which provides salvage and subrogation and health care recovery services. ESIS’s services are available through a preferred relationship with ACE Risk







Management or separately for those clients that select insurance and claims management services independently. The net results for ESIS are included in Insurance – North American’s
administrative expenses.

ACE Westchester offers wholesale distribution of excess and surplus property, inland marine, casualty,
professional lines, and environmental liability products. Its ACE Commercial Risk Services unit addresses the needs of wholesale brokers with accounts requiring rapid quotes for less complex exposures. ACE Westchester’s Program division
provides coverage for agriculture business and specialty programs, writing a variety of commercial coverages through program agents, including sports/leisure activities, farm, and crop/hail insurance. We write crop insurance business throughout the
U.S. through Rain and Hail. During the fourth quarter of 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Rain and Hail not already owned by us. Rain and Hail provides comprehensive multiple peril crop and crop/hail insurance protection to
customers in the U.S. and Canada. For more information, refer to “Crop Insurance”, under Item 7.

ACE Bermuda is our
original insurance company. It provides commercial insurance products on an excess basis mainly to a global client base targeting Fortune 1000 companies and covering exposures that are generally low in frequency and high in severity. ACE Bermuda
offers excess liability, professional lines, excess property, and political risk, the latter being written on a subscription basis by Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd. (Sovereign), a wholly owned managing agent. ACE Bermuda accesses its clients
primarily through the Bermuda offices of major, internationally recognized insurance brokers.

ACE Private Risk Services provides
personal lines coverages including homeowners, automobile, valuables, umbrella liability, and recreational marine insurance for affluent individuals and families in North America. ACE Private Risk Services’ products are distributed through
independent regional agents and brokers.

The run-off operations include Brandywine Holdings Corporation (Brandywine), Commercial
Insurance Services, residual market workers’ compensation business, pools and syndicates not attributable to a single business group, and other exited lines of business. Run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are
responsible for the management of existing policies and settlement of related claims.



Competitive Environment



Insurance – Overseas General



Overview

The Insurance – Overseas General segment, which accounted for 39 percent of 2010 consolidated net premiums earned, comprises ACE International, our global retail insurance operations, the wholesale insurance
business of ACE Global Markets, and the international A&H and life business of Combined Insurance. ACE International is our retail business serving territories outside the U.S., Bermuda, and Canada. ACE Global Markets, our London-based excess
and surplus lines business, includes Lloyd’s of London (Lloyd’s) Syndicate 2488 (Syndicate 2488). ACE provides funds at Lloyd’s to support underwriting by Syndicate 2488, which is managed by ACE Underwriting Agencies Limited and has
an underwriting capacity of £360 million for 2011. The reinsurance operation of ACE Global Markets is included in the Global Reinsurance segment.



Products and Distribution

ACE International
maintains a presence in every major insurance market in the world and is organized geographically along product lines that provide dedicated underwriting focus to customers. ACE International’s P&C business is generally written, on both a
direct and assumed basis, through major international, regional, and local brokers and agents. Its A&H and other con-







sumer lines products are distributed through brokers, agents, direct marketing programs, and sponsor relationships. Certain ACE Europe branded products are also offered via an e-commerce
platform, ACE Online, that allows brokers to quote, bind, and issue specialty policies online. Property insurance products include traditional commercial fire coverage as well as energy industry-related, construction, and other technical coverages.
Principal casualty products are commercial primary and excess casualty, environmental, marine and general liability. ACE International also provides D&O, and professional indemnity coverages. The A&H operations primarily offer personal
accident and supplemental medical products to meet the insurance needs of individuals and groups outside of U.S. insurance markets. These coverages include, but are not limited to, accidental death, business/holiday travel, specified disease, credit
life, disability, medical and hospital indemnity, and income protection coverages. We are not in the primary health care business. With respect to our supplemental medical and hospital indemnity products, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims
and are therefore, insulated from rising health care costs. ACE International’s personal lines operations provide specialty products and services designed to meet the needs of specific target markets and include, but are not limited to,
property damage, auto, homeowners, and personal liability.

The following is a discussion of ACE International’s areas of
operations: ACE Europe, ACE Asia Pacific, ACE Far East, and ACE Latin America.

• ACE Europe is headquartered in London and offers a broad range of
P&C, A&H, and specialty coverages throughout the European Union, Central and Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, North Africa, and South Africa. ACE’s operations in these regions comprise both
insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures.

• ACE Asia Pacific is headquartered in Singapore and has an extensive network of operations offering a
broad range of P&C, A&H, and specialty coverages principally directed at large and mid-sized corporations as well as individual consumers. This region also provides management, underwriting, reinsurance protection and administrative support
to our equity investee, Huatai Insurance Company of China, Limited.

• ACE Far East is based in Tokyo and offers a broad range of P&C, A&H,
and personal lines insurance products and services to businesses and consumers in Japan, principally delivered through an extensive agency network.

• ACE Latin America includes business operations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on P&C, A&H, and specialty personal lines
insurance products and services to both large and small commercial clients as well as individual consumers.

ACE Global Markets offers
products through its parallel distribution network via ACE European Group Limited (AEGL) and Syndicate 2488. ACE Global Markets utilizes Syndicate 2488 to underwrite P&C business on a global basis through Lloyd’s worldwide licenses. ACE
Global Markets utilizes AEGL to underwrite similar classes of business through its network of U.K. and European licenses, and in the U.S. where it is eligible to write excess and surplus lines business. Factors influencing the decision to place
business with Syndicate 2488 or AEGL include licensing eligibilities, capitalization requirements, and client/broker preference. All business underwritten by ACE Global Markets is accessed through registered brokers. The main lines of business
include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, political risk, and A&H.

Combined Insurance uses an international
sales force of independent contractor agents to distribute a wide range of supplemental A&H products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical conditions and cancer aid, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these
products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.



Competitive Environment

ACE International’s primary competitors include U.S.-based
companies with global operations, as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in regional and local markets. For the A&H lines of business, including those offered by Combined Insurance, locally-based competitors include
financial institutions and bank-owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies
on a locally admitted basis. The principal competitive factors that affect the international operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of
policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also giving us
the advantage of accessing local technical expertise, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a global network to service multi-national accounts.

ACE Global Markets is one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks underwritten for all lines of business. This
leadership position allows ACE Global Markets to set the policy terms and conditions of many of the policies written. All lines of business face competition, depending on the business class, from Lloyd’s syndicates, the London market, and other
major international insurers and reinsurers.







Competition for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. ACE Global Markets differentiates itself from competitors through long standing
experience in its product lines, its multiple insurance entities (Syndicate 2488 and AEGL), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.



Global Reinsurance



Overview

The Global Reinsurance segment, which accounted for eight percent of 2010 consolidated
net premiums earned, represents ACE’s reinsurance operations comprising ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re International, and ACE Tempest Re Canada. Global Reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide under the
ACE Tempest Re brand name and provides a broad range of products to a diverse array of primary P&C insurers.



Products and Distribution

Global Reinsurance services clients globally through its major units.
Major international brokers submit business to one or more of these units’ underwriting teams who have built strong relationships with both key brokers and clients by providing a responsive, client-focused approach to risk assessment and
pricing.

ACE Tempest Re Bermuda principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis globally to insurers of
commercial and personal property. Property catastrophe reinsurance is on an occurrence basis and protects a ceding company against an accumulation of losses covered by its issued insurance policies, arising from a common event or occurrence. ACE
Tempest Re Bermuda underwrites reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis, meaning that its exposure only arises after the ceding company’s accumulated losses have exceeded the attachment point of the reinsurance policy. ACE Tempest Re
Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for selected clients. Examples include proportional property (the reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the ceding company) and per risk excess of loss
treaty reinsurance (coverage applies on a per risk basis rather than per event or aggregate basis), together with casualty and specialty lines (catastrophe workers’ compensation, crop and terrorism). ACE Tempest Re Bermuda’s business is
produced through reinsurance intermediaries.

ACE Tempest Re USA writes all lines of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance for
the U.S. market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance. ACE Tempest Re USA underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis. This unit’s diversified portfolio is
produced through reinsurance intermediaries.

ACE Tempest Re International provides P&C treaty reinsurance to insurance companies
worldwide, with emphasis on non-U.S. and Canada risks. ACE Tempest Re International writes all lines of traditional and specialty reinsurance including property risk and property catastrophe, casualty, marine, and aviation, through our London- and
Zurich-based divisions. The London-based divisions of ACE Tempest Re International focus on the development of business sourced through London market brokers and, consequently, write a diverse book of international business utilizing Syndicate 2488
and AEGL. The Zurich-based division focuses on providing reinsurance to continental European insurers via continental European brokers. ACE Tempest Re International also includes our Shanghai office which provides reinsurance coverage for
Chinese-based risks and our Sao Paulo, Brazil office which provides reinsurance for Brazilian-based risks. ACE Tempest Re International underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.

ACE Tempest Re Canada offers a full array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance to the Canadian market, including casualty, property risk
and property catastrophe. ACE Tempest Re Canada provides its coverage through its Canadian company platform and also offers its clients access to Syndicate 2488. ACE Tempest Re Canada underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss
basis.



Competitive Environment

The Global Reinsurance segment competes worldwide with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi-line insurance
organizations. Over the last several years, capital markets participants have developed financial products intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. In addition, government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for
reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is considered a lead reinsurer and is typically involved in the negotiation and quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively
in P&C markets worldwide because of its strong capital position, analytical capabilities and quality service provided to customers, the leading role it plays in setting the terms, pricing, and conditions in negotiating contracts, and its
customized approach to risk selection. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line. An advantage of our international platform is that we are able to change our mix of business in response to







changes in competitive conditions in the territories in which we operate. Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies since all of our offices, with the exception of
Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators.



Life



Overview

Life, which accounted for 11 percent of 2010 consolidated net premiums earned, includes
ACE’s international life operations (ACE Life), ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance.



Products and Distribution

ACE Life Re’s core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life
insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed and variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. ACE Life Re’s U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new
business in January 2010. Since 2007, ACE Life Re has not quoted new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on successfully managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract
basis. This business is managed with a long-term perspective and short-term earnings volatility is expected.

Combined Insurance
distributes specialty individual accident and supplemental health and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Combined Insurance’s North American substantial sales force distribute a wide range of
supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity
benefit obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.



Competitive Environment

ACE Life’s
competition differs by location but generally includes multi-national insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. ACE’s financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a
global presence gives ACE Life a strong base from which to compete. While ACE Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined
Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.









Underwriting

ACE is an underwriting company and we strive to
emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to employ consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection in order to maintain a profitable book of business throughout market cycles.
Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the establishment of best practices throughout the
world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review structure that helps ensure control of risk
quality and conservative use of policy limits and terms and conditions.

Qualified actuaries in each region work closely with the
underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process. We use sophisticated catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques designed to ensure appropriate spread of risk and to analyze correlation of risk across different
product lines and territories. This helps to ensure that losses are contained within our risk tolerance and appetite for individual products lines, businesses, and ACE as a whole. We also purchase reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit
the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks, refer to “Reinsurance Protection”. For more information refer to “Insurance and Reinsurance Markets”, under Item 1A, “Catastrophe
Management” and “Natural Catastrophe Property Reinsurance Program”, under Item 7, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Reinsurance Protection

A separate policy and
process exists for captive reinsurance companies. Generally, these reinsurance companies are established by our clients or our clients have an interest in them. It is generally our policy to obtain collateral equal to the expected losses that may be
ceded to the captive. Where appropriate, exceptions to the collateral requirement are granted but only after senior management review. Specific collateral guidelines and an exception process are in place for ACE USA and Insurance – Overseas
General, both of which have credit management units evaluating the captive’s credit quality and that of their parent company. The credit management units, working with actuarial, determine reasonable exposure estimates (collateral
calculations), ensure receipt of collateral in a form acceptable to the Company, and coordinate collateral adjustments as and when needed. Currently, financial reviews and expected loss evaluations are performed annually for active captive
accounts and as needed for run-off exposures. In addition to collateral, parental guarantees are often used to enhance the credit quality of the captive.

In general, we seek to place our reinsurance with highly rated companies with which we have a strong trading relationship. For more information refer to “Catastrophe Management” and “Natural
Catastrophe Property Reinsurance Program” under Item 7, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses

We establish reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses, which are estimates of future payments on reported and unreported claims for losses and related expenses,
with respect to insured events that have occurred. The process of establishing loss and loss expense reserves for P&C claims can be complex and is subject to considerable uncertainty as it requires the use of informed estimates and judgments
based on circumstances known at the date of accrual. These estimates and judgments are







based on numerous factors, and may be revised as additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, as new or improved methodologies are developed, or as laws change. We have
actuarial staff in each of our operating segments who regularly analyze the levels of loss and loss expense reserves, taking into consideration factors that may impact the ultimate settlement value of the unpaid losses and loss expenses. These
analyses could result in future changes in the estimates of loss and loss expense reserves or reinsurance recoverables and any such changes would be reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the estimates are changed. Losses and
loss expenses are charged to income as incurred. The reserve for unpaid losses and loss expenses represents the estimated ultimate losses and loss expenses less paid losses and loss expenses, and comprises case reserves and incurred but not reported
(IBNR) loss reserves. With the exception of certain structured settlements, for which the timing and amount of future claim payments are reliably determinable, our loss reserves are not discounted for the time value of money. In connection with
these structured settlements, we carried net reserves of $69 million, net of discount, at December 31, 2010.

During the loss
settlement period, which can be many years in duration, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known. As these become apparent, case reserves may be adjusted by allocation from IBNR without any change in the
overall reserve. In addition, the circumstances of individual claims or the application of statistical and actuarial methods to loss experience data may lead to the adjustment of the overall reserves upward or downward from time to time.
Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses may be significantly greater than or less than reported loss and loss expense reserves.

We have considered asbestos and environmental (A&E) claims and claims expenses in establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses
and have developed reserving methods which consider historical experience as well as incorporate new sources of data to estimate the ultimate losses arising from A&E exposures. The reserves for A&E claims and claims expenses represent
management’s best estimate of future loss and loss expense payments and recoveries that are expected to develop over the next several decades. We continuously monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and latent injury claims,
we monitor A&E claims activity quarterly, and we perform a full reserve review annually.

For each product line, management, in
conjunction with internal actuaries, develops a “best estimate” of the ultimate settlement value of the unpaid losses and loss expenses that it believes provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. We evaluate our estimates of
reserves quarterly in light of developing information. While we are unable at this time to determine whether additional reserves may be necessary in the future, we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are adequate at
December 31, 2010. Future additions to reserves, if needed, could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

For more information refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates – Unpaid losses and loss expenses”, under Item 7 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.

The “Analysis of Losses and Loss Expenses Development” table shown below presents, for each balance sheet date over the period 2000-2010,
the gross and net loss and loss expense reserves recorded at the balance sheet date and subsequent net payments on the associated liabilities. The reserves represent the amount required for the estimated future settlement value of liabilities
incurred at or prior to the balance sheet date and those estimates may change subsequent to the balance sheet date as new information emerges regarding the ultimate settlement value of the liability. Accordingly, the table also presents through
December 31, 2010, for each balance sheet date, the cumulative impact of subsequent valuations of the liabilities incurred at the original balance sheet date. The data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements of the
SEC. This table should be interpreted with care by those not familiar with its format or those who are familiar with other triangulations arranged by origin year of loss such as accident or underwriting year rather than balance sheet date, as shown
below. To clarify the interpretation of the table, we use the reserves established at December 31, 2000, in the following example.

The top two lines of the table show, for successive balance sheet dates, the gross and net unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded as provision for
liabilities incurred at or prior to each balance sheet date. It can be seen that at December 31, 2000, a reserve of $9.437 billion net of reinsurance had been established.

The upper (paid) triangulation presents the net amounts paid as of periods subsequent to the balance sheet date. Hence in the 2001 financial year, $2.425 billion of payments were made on liabilities contemplated in
the December 31, 2000, reserve balance. At the end of the 2010 financial year, there were cumulative net payments of $7.543 billion on this block of liabilities.

The lower triangulation within the table shows the revised estimate of the net liability originally recorded at each balance sheet date as of the end of subsequent financial years. With the benefit of actual loss
emergence and hindsight over the intervening period, the net liabilities incurred as of December 31, 2000, are now estimated to be $11.5 billion, rather than the original estimate of $9.437 billion. One of the key drivers of this change has
been adverse development on latent claims that







we categorize as A&E covered under the National Indemnity Company (NICO) reinsurance treaties. Of the cumulative deficiency of $2.063 billion recognized in the ten years since
December 31, 2000, $758 million relates to non-latent claims and $1.305 billion relates to latent claims. The deficiency of $2.063 billion was identified and recorded as follows; $159 million deficient in 2001, $576 million deficient in 2002,
$245 million deficient in 2003, $880 million deficient in 2004, $66 million redundant in 2005, $164 million deficient in 2006, $24 million deficient in 2007, $101 million deficient in 2008, $31 million redundant in 2009, and $11 million deficient in
2010.

Importantly, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for different balance sheet dates are not independent and, therefore, should
not be added together. In the last year, we revised our estimate of the December 31, 2000, liabilities from $11.489 billion to $11.5 billion. This adverse development of $11 million will also be included in each column to the right of the
December 31, 2000, column to recognize that this additional amount was also required in the reserves established for each annual balance sheet date from December 31, 2001, to December 31, 2010.

The loss development table shows that our original estimate of the net unpaid loss and loss expense requirement at December 31, 2009, of
$25.038 billion has, with the benefit of actual loss emergence and hindsight, been revised to $24.481 billion at December 31, 2010. This favorable movement of $557 million is referred to as prior period development and is the net result of a
number of underlying movements both favorable and adverse. The key underlying movements are discussed in more detail within the “Prior Period Development” section of Item 7.

The bottom lines of the table show the re-estimated amount of previously recorded gross liabilities at December 31, 2010, together with the
change in reinsurance recoverable. Similar to the net liabilities, the cumulative redundancy or deficiency on the gross liability is the difference between the gross liability originally recorded and the re-estimated gross liability at
December 31, 2010. For example, with respect to the gross unpaid loss and loss expenses of $17.603 billion for December 31, 2000, this gross liability was re-estimated to be $24.539 billion at December 31, 2010, resulting in the
cumulative deficiency on the gross liability originally recorded for the 2000 balance sheet year of $6.936 billion. This deficiency relates primarily to U.S. liabilities, including A&E liabilities for 1996 and prior. The gross deficiency results
in a net deficiency of $2.063 billion after consideration of substantial reinsurance coverage that reduces the gross loss; approximately $2.2 billion was covered by reinsurance placed when the risks were originally written and $1.25 billion of the
remaining liability has been ceded under the Brandywine NICO Agreement.

We do not consider it appropriate to extrapolate future
deficiencies or redundancies based upon the table, as conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily recur in the future. We believe that our current estimates of net liabilities
appropriately reflect our current knowledge of the business profile and the prevailing market, social, legal, and economic conditions while giving due consideration to historical trends and volatility evidenced in our markets over the longer
term. The key issues and considerations involved in establishing our estimate of the net liabilities are discussed in more detail within the “Critical Accounting Estimates – Unpaid losses and loss expenses” section of
Item 7.

On April 1, 2008, we acquired Combined Insurance. On December 1, 2010, we acquired Jerneh Insurance Berhad. On
December 28, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding commons stock of Rain and Hail not previously owned by us. The unpaid loss information for these acquisitions has been included in the table commencing in the year of acquisition.

Investments

Our objective is to maximize investment income and total return while ensuring an appropriate level of liquidity, investment quality and diversification. As such,
ACE’s investment portfolio is invested primarily in investment-grade fixed-income securities as measured by the major rating agencies. We do not allow leverage or complex credit structures in our investment portfolio.

The critical aspects of the investment process are controlled by ACE Asset Management, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ACE. These aspects
include asset allocation, portfolio and guideline design, risk management and oversight of external asset managers. In this regard, ACE Asset Management:

• conducts formal asset allocation modeling for each of the ACE subsidiaries, providing formal recommendations for the portfolio’s structure;

• establishes recommended investment guidelines that are appropriate to the prescribed asset allocation targets;

• provides the analysis, evaluation, and selection of our external investment advisors;

• establishes and develops investment-related analytics to enhance portfolio engineering and risk control;

• monitors and aggregates the correlated risk of the overall investment portfolio; and

• provides governance over the investment process for each of our operating companies to ensure consistency of approach and adherence to investment guidelines.

Under our guidance and direction, external asset managers conduct security and sector selection, transaction execution and portfolio accounting.
This use of multiple managers benefits ACE in several ways – it provides us with operational and cost efficiencies, diversity of styles and approaches, innovations in investment research and credit and risk management, all of which enhance the
risk adjusted returns of our portfolios.







ACE Asset Management determines the investment portfolio’s allowable, targeted asset allocation
and ranges for each of the operating segments. These asset allocation targets are derived from sophisticated asset and liability modeling that measures correlated histories of returns and volatility of returns. Allowable investment classes are
further refined through analysis of our operating environment, including expected volatility of cash flows, potential impact on our capital position, as well as regulatory and rating agency considerations.

Under the overall supervision of the Finance and Investment Committee of the Board, ACE’s governance over investment management is rigorous and
ongoing. Among its responsibilities, the Finance and Investment Committee of the Board:

• reviews and approves asset allocation targets and
investment policy to ensure that it is consistent with our overall goals, strategies, and objectives;

• reviews and approves investment guidelines
to ensure that appropriate levels of portfolio liquidity, credit quality, diversification, and volatility are maintained; and

• systematically
reviews the portfolio’s exposures including any potential violations of investment guidelines.

We have long-standing global credit
limits for our entire portfolio across the organization and for individual obligors. Exposures are aggregated, monitored, and actively managed by our Global Credit Committee, comprised of senior executives, including our Chief Financial Officer, our
Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Investment Officer, and our Treasurer. Additionally, the Board has established a Risk Committee which helps execute the Board’s supervisory responsibilities pertaining to enterprise risk management including
investment risk.

Within the guidelines and asset allocation parameters established by the Finance and Investment Committee, individual
investment committees of the operating segments determine tactical asset allocation. Additionally, these committees review all investment-related activity that affects their operating company, including the selection of outside investment advisors,
proposed asset allocations changes, and the systematic review of investment guidelines.

For additional information regarding the
investment portfolio, including breakdowns of the sector and maturity distributions, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Regulation

Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally, including all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia. Our businesses in
each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require among other things that these
subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus and liquidity, meet solvency standards, and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition. The complex regulatory environments in which ACE operates are subject to
change and are regularly monitored. The following is an overview discussion of regulations for our operations in Switzerland, the U.S., Bermuda, and other international locations.



Swiss Operations

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, which we refer to as “FINMA” has the discretion to supervise our group activities. Under so-called “group supervision,” FINMA has the right to
supervise the Company on a group-wide basis. The regulatory power of FINMA covers in particular the following areas:

• reporting on organization;

• reporting on structure;

• reporting on
internal transactions;

• solvency;

•
group/conglomerate report; and

• corporate governance/risk management/internal control system.

In 2008, we received written confirmation from the Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI), a FINMA predecessor insurance supervising authority,
that it does not intend to subject us to group supervision so long as certain business parameters within Switzerland are not exceeded. From time to time, we may exceed these parameters. While we cannot assure you that FINMA will not change these
parameters or otherwise begin to exercise group supervision over us, we do not presently foresee becoming subject to such group supervision at ACE’s current or anticipated business levels in Switzerland. However, the costs and administrative
burdens of group supervision, should we be subjected to it, could be substantial. Late in 2008, we formed ACE Insurance (Switzerland) Limited which offers various insurance covers to small and mid-sized Swiss companies, as well as A&H solutions
to individuals. We have also formed a reinsurance subsidiary named ACE Reinsurance (Switzerland) Limited which we operate as primarily a provider of reinsurance to other ACE entities. Both new companies are licensed and governed by FINMA.







U.S. Operations

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states
establish departments of insurance with broad authority to regulate, among other things: the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their producers, approval of policy forms and rates, the nature of and
limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of the risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for the acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the
affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports of financial condition required to be filed, and the adequacy of reserves for unearned premiums, losses, and other purposes.

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and quarterly reports with state insurance regulators in each of the states in
which they do business. In addition, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ operations and financial records are subject to examination at regular intervals by state regulators.

All states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding companies. This legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state
of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a
holding company system must be fair and equitable. Notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and
an entity in its holding company system; in addition, certain transactions may not be consummated without the department’s prior approval.

Statutory surplus is an important measure utilized by the regulators and rating agencies to assess our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ ability to support business operations and provide dividend capacity. Our
U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are
generally based on calculations incorporating statutory surplus, statutory net income, and/or investment income.

The National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has a risk-based capital requirement for P&C insurance companies. This risk-based capital formula is used by many state regulatory authorities to identify insurance companies that may be
undercapitalized and which merit further regulatory attention. These requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy using a formula that prescribes a series of risk measurements to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company,
based on the profile of the individual company. The ratio of a company’s actual policyholder surplus to its minimum capital requirement will determine whether any state regulatory action is required. There are progressive risk-based capital
failure levels that trigger more stringent regulatory action. If an insurer’s policyholders’ surplus falls below the Mandatory Control Level (70 percent of the Authorized Control Level, as defined by the NAIC), the relevant insurance
commissioner is required to place the insurer under regulatory control. However, an insurance commissioner may allow a P&C company operating below the Mandatory Control Level that is writing no business and is running off its existing business
to continue its run-off. Brandywine is running off its liabilities consistent with the terms of an order issued by the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania. This includes periodic reporting obligations to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.

Government intervention has also occurred in the insurance and reinsurance markets in relation to terrorism coverage in the U.S. (and
through industry initiatives in other countries). The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts in the U.S., was extended in 2007 for
seven years, through 2014, and applies to certain of our operations.

From time to time, ACE and its subsidiaries and affiliates receive
inquiries from state agencies and attorneys general, with which we generally comply, seeking information concerning business practices, such as underwriting and non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. Moreover, many recent factors,
such as consequences of and reactions to industry and economic conditions as well as a change in the presidential administration and focus on domestic issues, have contributed to the potential for change in the legal and regulatory framework
applicable to ACE’s U.S. operations and businesses. We cannot assure you that changes in laws or investigative or enforcement activities in the various U.S states will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of
operations, or business practices. More information on insurance industry investigations, including settlement agreements and related matters, is set forth in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Bermuda Operations

In Bermuda, our insurance subsidiaries are principally regulated by the Insurance Act 1978 (as amended) and related regulations (the Bermuda Act). The Bermuda Act imposes solvency and liquidity standards as well as
auditing and reporting requirements, and grants the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the BMA) powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the







The BMA may appoint an inspector with extensive powers to investigate the affairs of an insurer if he or she believes that an investigation is required in the interest of the insurer’s policyholders or persons
who may become policyholders. If it appears to the BMA that there is a risk of the insurer becoming insolvent, or that the insurer is in breach of the Bermuda Act or any conditions of its registration under the Bermuda Act, the BMA may direct the
insurer not to take on any new insurance business, not to vary any insurance contract if the effect would be to increase the insurer’s liabilities, not to make certain investments, to realize certain investments, to maintain in, or transfer to
the custody of a specified bank certain assets, not to declare or pay any dividends or other distributions, or to restrict the making of such payments and/or to limit its premium income.

The Bermuda Act also requires the BMA to supervise persons carrying on insurance business, insurance managers, and intermediaries with the aim of
protecting the interests of clients and potential clients of such persons. The Bermuda Act requires every insurer to appoint a principal representative resident in Bermuda and to maintain a principal office in Bermuda. The principal representative
must be knowledgeable in insurance and is responsible for arranging the maintenance and custody of the statutory accounting records and for filing the annual statutory financial return.



Other International Operations

The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which the non-U.S. ACE operations conduct business. While each country imposes
licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example:

•
in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports;

• some regulators
require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;

• the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of foreign reinsurance vary;

• policy form
filing and rate regulation vary by country;

• the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by
country; and

• regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.

Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance
activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.

ACE
operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches of those subsidiaries. Local capital requirements applicable to a subsidiary generally include its branches. Certain ACE companies are jointly owned with local
companies to comply with legal requirements for local ownership. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, local retention of funds and records, data privacy and protection program
requirements, and foreign exchange controls. ACE’s international companies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.

Moreover, there are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact ACE in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant impact on ACE could be heightened as a result of recent
industry and economic developments. In particular, the European Union’s (EU) executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations for the European insurance industry, known as Solvency
II, which aims to establish a revised set of EU-wide capital requirements and risk management standards that will replace the current Solvency I requirements. Once finalized, Solvency II is expected to set out new, strengthened requirements
applicable to the entire EU relating to capital







adequacy and risk management for insurers. Other jurisdictions such as Bermuda and Switzerland are likely to strengthen their respective capital and risk management requirements.



Enterprise Risk Management

As an insurer, ACE is in the business of risk management for profit. As a result, enterprise risk management, or ERM, is a part of the day-to-day management of the
Company and its operations. Because risk management must permeate an organization conducting insurance businesses around the world, we have established an ERM process that is integrated into management of our businesses and is led by ACE’s
senior management.

Our global ERM framework is broadly multi-disciplinary and its objectives include:

• support core risk management responsibilities at division and corporate levels through the identification and management of risks that aggregate and/or
correlate across divisions;

• identify, analyze, and mitigate significant external risks that could impair the financial condition of ACE and/or
hinder its business objectives;

• coordinate accumulation guidelines and actual exposure relative to guidelines, risk codes, and other risk
processes;

• provide analysis and maintain accumulation and economic capital and information systems that enable business leaders to make
appropriate and consistent risk/return decisions;

• identify and assess emerging risk issues; and

• develop and communicate to the Company’s business lines consistent risk management processes.

The Company’s Enterprise Risk Management Board (ERMB) reports to and assists the Chief Executive Officer in the oversight and review of
ACE’s ERM framework. The ERMB is chaired by the Company’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. The ERMB oversees and monitors the processes and guidelines used to manage insurance risk, financial risk, strategic risk, and operational
risk. The ERMB governance framework relies in part on establishment and maintenance of risk limits and a risk matrix through which inherent and residual risks across the organization are catalogued. The ERMB meets at least monthly, and is comprised
of the Company’s most senior executives, in addition to the Chair: the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Claims Officer, General Counsel, Chief Executive Officer for Insurance – North
America, Chief Executive Officer for ACE Overseas General, and our Chief Executive Officer for Global Reinsurance.

The ERMB is provided
support from various sources, including the Enterprise Risk Unit (ERU) and product boards. The ERU is responsible for the collation and analysis of two types of information. First, external information that provides insight to the ERMB on risks that
might imperil ACE’s key objectives and second, internal information on single named, product, and cross-product accumulations. The ERU is independent of the operating units and reports to our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. The Product
Boards exist to provide oversight for products that the Company offers globally. A Product Board currently exists for each of the following products; property/energy, marine, casualty, financial lines, aviation, and political risk. Each Product
Board is responsible for ensuring consistency in underwriting and pricing standards, identification of emerging issues, and single name accumulation guidelines.

The Company’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary also reports to the Board’s Risk Committee, which helps execute the Board’s supervisory responsibilities pertaining to ERM. The role of the Risk
Committee includes evaluation of the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’s ERM procedures and systems and information; oversight of policy decisions pertaining to risk aggregation and minimization, including credit risk; and assessment
of the Company’s major decisions and preparedness levels pertaining to perceived material risks. The Audit Committee, which regularly meets jointly with the Risk Committee, provides oversight of the financial reporting process and safeguarding
of assets.

Others within the ERM structure contribute toward accomplishing ACE’s ERM objectives, including regional management,
Internal Audit, Compliance, external consultants, and managers of our internal control processes and procedures.
