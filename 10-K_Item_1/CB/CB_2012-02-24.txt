ITEM 1.Business



General Development of Business

ACE Limited is the Swiss-incorporated holding company of the ACE Group of
Companies. ACE opened its business office in Bermuda in 1985 and continues to maintain operations in Bermuda. ACE Limited, which is headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, and its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the ACE Group of
Companies, ACE, we, us, or our) is a global insurance and reinsurance organization, serving the needs of customers in more than 170 countries. We offer commercial insurance products and service offerings such as risk management programs, loss
control and engineering and complex claims management. We also provide specialized insurance products ranging from Directors & Officers (D&O) and professional liability to various specialty-casualty and umbrella and excess casualty
lines to niche areas such as aviation and energy. In addition, we supply personal accident, supplemental health, and life insurance to individuals in select countries. At December 31, 2011, ACE had total assets of $88 billion and
shareholders’ equity of $25 billion.



We have grown our business
through increased premium volume, expansion of product offerings and geographic reach, and acquisition of other companies.



We acquired New York Life’s Korea operations on February 1, 2011 and New York Life’s Hong Kong operations on April 1, 2011 for approximately
$425 million in cash. The addition of these operations expands our presence in Asia and complements the life insurance business. These acquired businesses operate under our Life segment.



We acquired Penn Millers Holding Corporation (PMHC) on November 30, 2011 for approximately $107 million in cash. PMHC’s primary
insurance subsidiary, Penn Millers Insurance Company, is a well-established underwriter in the agribusiness market since 1887 and currently operates in 34 states. PMHC operates under our Insurance – North American segment. We acquired Rio
Guayas Compania de Seguros y Reaseguros (Rio Guayas), a general insurance company in Ecuador on December 28, 2011. Rio Guayas sells a range of insurance products, including auto, life, property, and accident and health (A&H). The
acquisition of Rio Guayas will expand our capabilities in terms of geography, products, and distribution. Rio Guayas operates under our Insurance – Overseas General segment.



Employees

At December 31, 2011, there were
approximately 16,500 employees in the ACE Group of Companies. We believe that employee relations are satisfactory.



Customers

For most of the commercial lines of business that we offer, insureds typically use the services of
an insurance broker or agent. An insurance broker acts as an agent for the insureds, offering advice on the types and amount of insurance to purchase and also assisting in the negotiation of price and terms and conditions. We obtain business from
the local and major international insurance brokers and typically pay a commission to brokers for any business accepted and bound. Loss of all or a substantial portion of the business provided by one or more of these brokers could have a material
adverse effect on our business. In our opinion, no material part of our business is dependent upon a single insured or group of insureds. We do not believe that the loss of any one insured would have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations and no one insured or group of affiliated insureds account for as much as 10 percent of our consolidated revenues.



Competition

Competition in the insurance and reinsurance
marketplace is substantial. Competition varies by type of business and geographic area. Competitors include other stock companies, mutual companies, alternative risk sharing groups (such as group captives and catastrophe pools), and other
underwriting organizations. These companies sell through various distribution channels and business models, across a broad array of product lines, and with a high level of variation regarding geographic, marketing, and customer segmentation. We
compete for business not only on the basis of price, but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service. Our ability to compete is dependent on a number of factors, particularly our ability to maintain
the appropriate financial strength ratings as assigned by independent rating agencies. Our broad market capabilities in commercial, specialty and A&H lines made available by our underwriting expertise, business infrastructure and global
presence, defines our competitive advantage. Our strong balance sheet is attractive to businesses, such as ceding companies







requiring security solutions, and our strong capital position and global platform affords us opportunities for growth not available to smaller, less diversified insurance companies. Refer to
“Segment Information” for competitive environment by segment.



Trademarks and Trade
Names

We use various trademarks and trade names in our business. These trademarks and trade names protect names of certain products and services we
offer and are important to the extent they provide goodwill and name recognition in the insurance industry. We use commercially reasonable efforts to protect these proprietary rights, including various trade secret and trademark laws. One or more of
the trademarks and trade names could be material to our ability to sell our products and services. We have taken appropriate steps to protect our ownership of key names and we believe it is unlikely that anyone would be able to prevent us from using
names in places or circumstances material to our operations.

Additional financial information about our segments, including net premiums earned by geographic area, is included in
Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Insurance – North American



Overview

The Insurance – North American
segment comprises our operations in the U.S., Canada, and Bermuda. This segment, which accounted for 45 percent of our 2011 consolidated net premiums earned, includes our retail divisions ACE USA (including ACE Canada), ACE Commercial Risk Services,
and ACE Private Risk Services; our wholesale and specialty divisions ACE Westchester, ACE Agriculture and ACE Bermuda; and various run-off operations, including Brandywine Holdings Corporation (Brandywine).



Products and Distribution

ACE USA, our retail operating division in North America, provides a broad array of P&C, A&H, and risk management products and services to a diverse group of
North American commercial and non commercial enterprises and consumers. ACE USA is this segment’s largest operation and represented approximately 49 percent of Insurance – North American’s net premiums earned in 2011. ACE USA
distributes its insurance products primarily through a limited number of retail brokers. In addition to using brokers, certain products are also distributed through general agents, independent agents, managing general agents (MGA), managing general
underwriters, alliances, affinity groups, and direct marketing operations. Products offered include property, general liability, excess liability, workers’ compensation, commercial marine, automobile liability, professional lines D&O and
errors and omissions (E&O), medical liability, aerospace, and A&H coverages, as well as claims and risk management products and services.



ACE USA’s on-going operations are organized into the following distinct business units, each offering specialized products and services targeted at specific
niche markets:



• ACE Risk Management offers a wide range of
customized casualty products to respond to the needs of mid-size to large companies, including national accounts, irrespective of industry. These programs are designed to help insureds address the significant costs of financing and managing risk for
workers’ compensation and general and auto liability coverages. A variety of program structures are offered to support each client’s risk financing needs including: large deductible, captives, third-party rent-a-captives, funded
deductibles, paid or incurred loss retrospective plans, and net present value and other risk financing structures, including a prospective close-out product. We also underwrite assumed loss portfolio contracts in which insured loss events have
occurred prior to the inception of the contract, when the contract carries the requisite amount of insurance risk transfer. These contracts can cause significant variances to premiums, losses and loss expenses, and expense ratios in the periods in
which they are written.



• ACE Foreign Casualty provides products
which insure specific global operating risks of U.S.-based multinational companies. Coverage programs include Controlled Master Programs where we pair a master policy issued in the U.S. with local policies issued in foreign countries, International
Advantage covering liability and incidental property cover for U.S.-based companies with employees who travel on business outside of the U.S., and Defense Base Act Workers’ Compensation which provides coverage for prime contractors and
subcontractors performing work overseas under contracts authorized, approved or financed by the U.S. government or its agencies. In addition, Foreign Casualty has deductible programs, captive programs, and paid or incurred loss retrospective plans
for U.S.-based insured’s foreign operations.



• ACE North America
Property & Specialty Lines, through its specialized operating units, offers a wide range of products to diverse insureds. Property products include primary, quota share and excess all-risk insurance for U.S. based companies with
domestic or global exposures, as well as risk management programs and services for U.S. multinational companies, including Controlled Master Programs and captive programs. Commercial Marine products are available for U.S. and global marine
exposures. Inland Marine products provide solutions for the construction, transportation, warehouse and communications industries, as well as museums and other commercial institutions with fine art exposures. Aerospace products are
available for airport owners and operators, as well as satellite operators. Other specialized units provide products for weather-related exposures, the unique needs of the energy industry, and engineering and insurance-related services for the
operating units.



• ACE Casualty Risk offers specialty casualty
products to a broad range of customers, ranging from small, local businesses to large, multinational clients. Key coverages offered by ACE Casualty Risk include umbrella and excess liability, environmental risk for commercial and industrial risks,
and wrap-up programs written on a loss sensitive basis, protecting contractors and







project sponsors with multi-risk coverage on large single- and multi-location construction projects. We also write custom casualty products for specialized industry segments and unique risks as
well as products which address the needs of public entities such as educational institutions.



• ACE Professional Risk provides management liability and professional liability (D&O and E&O) as well as surety and kidnap & extortion products to middle market and Fortune 1000 clients.



• ACE Canada (ACE USA’s Canadian operations) offers a broad
range of P&C products as well as life and A&H coverage. ACE Canada specializes in providing customized products to commercial and industrial clients as well as to groups and associations, operating nationally or internationally.



• ACE Accident & Health works with employers, travel agencies, and
affinity groups to offer a variety of accident and other supplemental insurance programs. Key products include employee benefit plans, occupational accident, student accident, and worldwide travel accident and global medical programs. With respect
to products that include supplemental medical and hospital indemnity coverages, we typically pay fixed amounts for claims and are therefore insulated from rising health care costs. ACE Accident & Health also provides specialty personal
lines products, including credit card enhancement programs (identity theft, rental car collision damage waiver, trip travel, and purchase protection benefits), and disaster recovery programs distributed through affinity groups.



• ACE Medical Risk offers a wide range of liability products for the health care
industry only through licensed excess and surplus lines brokers. Products include primary coverages for professional liability and general liability for selected types of medical facilities, excess/umbrella liability for medical facilities, primary
and excess coverages for products liability for biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, and liability insurance for human clinical trials.



• ESIS Inc. (ESIS), ACE USA’s in-house third-party claims administrator, performs claims management and risk control services for domestic and
international organizations, as well as for the Insurance – North American segment. These services include comprehensive medical managed care, integrated disability services, and pre-loss control and risk management services. Additional
insurance-related services are offered by ESIS’s Recovery Services International, which provides salvage and subrogation and health care recovery services. ESIS’s services are available through a preferred relationship with ACE Risk
Management or separately for those clients that select insurance and claims management services independently. The net results for ESIS are included in Insurance – North American’s administrative expenses.



ACE Commercial Risk Services serves the insurance needs of small and mid-sized
businesses in North America with local, national or global exposures by delivering an array of specialty product solutions for targeted industries that lend themselves to technology-assisted underwriting. ACE Commercial Risk Services offers packaged
policies as well as solutions that can be tailored to suit a particular product segment, multiple lines of coverage or specific distribution channels using advanced systems to efficiently transact large volumes of business. Core products and
services for small businesses include: disaster protection, casualty insurance (including international casualty), environmental, inland marine, professional risk, medical risk, and claims & risk management services. These ACE Commercial
Risk Services’ products are offered through wholesale, retail, program agent and alternative distribution channels. In addition, ACE Commercial Risk Services offers coverage for specialty programs, writing a variety of commercial coverages
through program agents.



ACE Private Risk Services provides personal lines
coverages including homeowners, automobile, valuables, umbrella liability, and recreational marine insurance for high net worth individuals and families in North America. ACE Private Risk Services’ products are distributed through independent
regional agents and brokers.



ACE Westchester serves the market for
business risks that tends to be harder to place due to unique or complex exposures and offers wholesale distribution of excess and surplus property, inland marine, casualty, professional lines, and environmental liability products.



ACE Agriculture provides comprehensive multiple peril crop and crop/hail insurance
protection to customers throughout the U.S. and Canada through Rain and Hail Insurance Service, Inc. (Rain and Hail). Coverages include various revenue and income products, yield protection, crop, hail and nursery insurance. For additional
information, refer to “Crop Insurance”, under Item 7. To complement our agriculture business strategy, on November 30, 2011, we completed our acquisition of PMHC. PMHC’s primary insurance subsidiary, Penn Millers Insurance
Company, provides specialty property and casualty insurance coverages to companies that manufacture, process and distribute agriculture products.



ACE Bermuda is our original insurance company. It provides commercial insurance products on an excess basis mainly to a global client base targeting Fortune 1000
companies and covering exposures that are generally low in frequency and high in







severity. ACE Bermuda offers excess liability, professional lines, excess property, and political risk, the latter being written on a subscription basis by Sovereign Risk Insurance Ltd.
(Sovereign), a wholly-owned managing agent. ACE Bermuda accesses its clients primarily through the Bermuda offices of major, internationally recognized insurance brokers.



The run-off operations include Brandywine, Commercial Insurance Services, residual
market workers’ compensation business, pools and syndicates not attributable to a single business group, and other exited lines of business. Run-off operations do not actively sell insurance products, but are responsible for the management of
existing policies and settlement of related claims.



Competitive Environment



Insurance – Overseas General



Overview

The Insurance – Overseas General segment, which accounted for 37 percent of 2011 consolidated net premiums earned, comprises ACE International, our global retail insurance operations, the wholesale insurance
business of ACE Global Markets, and the international A&H and life business of Combined Insurance. ACE International is our retail business serving local companies and insureds to large multinationals outside the U.S., Bermuda, and Canada. ACE
Global Markets, our London-based excess and surplus lines business, includes Lloyd’s of London (Lloyd’s) Syndicate 2488 (Syndicate 2488). ACE provides funds at Lloyd’s to support underwriting by Syndicate 2488, which is managed by ACE
Underwriting Agencies Limited and has an underwriting capacity of £360 million for 2012. The reinsurance operation of ACE Global Markets is included in the Global Reinsurance segment.



Products and Distribution







The following is a discussion of ACE International’s areas of operations: ACE Europe, ACE Asia Pacific, ACE Far
East, and ACE Latin America.



• ACE Europe is headquartered in London
and offers a broad range of P&C, A&H, and specialty coverages throughout the European Union, Central and Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East, North Africa, and South Africa. ACE’s operations in these
regions comprise both insurance subsidiaries and joint ventures.



•
ACE Asia Pacific is headquartered in Singapore and has an extensive network of operations offering a broad range of P&C, A&H, and specialty coverages principally directed at large and mid-sized corporations as well as individual consumers.
This region also provides management, underwriting, reinsurance protection and administrative support to our equity investee, Huatai Insurance Company of China, Limited.



• ACE Far East is based in Tokyo and offers a broad range of P&C, A&H,
and personal lines insurance products and services to businesses and consumers in Japan, principally delivered through an extensive agency network.



• ACE Latin America includes business operations throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, focusing on P&C, A&H, and specialty personal lines
insurance products and services to both large and small commercial clients as well as individual consumers.



ACE Global Markets offers products through its parallel distribution network via ACE European Group Limited (AEGL) and Syndicate 2488. ACE Global Markets uses Syndicate 2488 to underwrite P&C business on a
global basis through Lloyd’s worldwide licenses. ACE Global Markets uses AEGL to underwrite similar classes of business through its network of U.K. and European licenses, and in the U.S. where it is eligible to write excess and surplus lines
business. Factors influencing the decision to place business with Syndicate 2488 or AEGL include licensing eligibilities, capitalization requirements, and client/broker preference. All business underwritten by ACE Global Markets is accessed through
registered brokers. The main lines of business include aviation, property, energy, professional lines, marine, political risk, and A&H.



Combined Insurance uses an international sales force of independent contractor agents to distribute a wide range of supplemental A&H products, including
personal accident, short-term disability, critical conditions and cancer aid, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily fixed-indemnity obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.



Competitive Environment

ACE International’s primary competitors include U.S.-based companies with global operations, as well as non-U.S. global carriers and indigenous companies in
regional and local markets. For the A&H lines of business, including those offered by Combined Insurance, locally-based competitors include financial institutions and bank-owned insurance subsidiaries. Our international operations have the
distinct advantage of being part of one of the few international insurance groups with a global network of licensed companies able to write policies on a locally admitted basis. The principal competitive factors that affect the international
operations are underwriting expertise and pricing, relative operating efficiency, product differentiation, producer relations, and the quality of policyholder services. A competitive strength of our international operations is our global network and
breadth of insurance programs, which assist individuals and business organizations to meet their risk management objectives, while also giving us the advantage of accessing local technical expertise, accomplishing a spread of risk, and offering a
global network to service multinational accounts.



ACE Global Markets is
one of the preeminent international specialty insurers in London and is an established lead underwriter on a significant portion of the risks underwritten for all lines of business. This leadership position allows ACE Global Markets to set the
policy terms and conditions of many of the policies written. All lines of business face competition, depending on the business class, from Lloyd’s syndicates, the London market, and other major international insurers and reinsurers. Competition
for international risks is also seen from domestic insurers in the country of origin of the insured. ACE Global Markets differentiates itself from competitors through long standing experience in its product lines, its multiple insurance entities
(Syndicate 2488 and AEGL), and the quality of its underwriting and claims service.



Global Reinsurance



Overview

The Global Reinsurance segment, which
accounted for seven percent of 2011 consolidated net premiums earned, represents ACE’s reinsurance operations comprising ACE Tempest Re Bermuda, ACE Tempest Re USA, ACE Tempest Re International, and ACE Tempest Re Canada. The Global Reinsurance
segment also includes ACE Global Markets’ reinsurance operations.







Global Reinsurance markets its reinsurance products worldwide under the ACE Tempest Re brand name and provides solutions for small to mid-sized clients and multinational ceding companies
including licensed reinsurance capabilities, property and workers’ compensation catastrophe, loss-warranty, stop-loss cover, marine and aviation programs.



Products and Distribution

Global Reinsurance
services clients globally through its major units. Major international brokers submit business to one or more of these units’ underwriting teams who have built strong relationships with both key brokers and clients by providing a responsive,
client-focused approach to risk assessment and pricing.



ACE Tempest Re
Bermuda principally provides property catastrophe reinsurance on an excess of loss basis globally to insurers of commercial and personal property. Property catastrophe reinsurance is on an occurrence basis and protects a ceding company against an
accumulation of losses covered by its issued insurance policies, arising from a common event or occurrence. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda underwrites reinsurance principally on an excess of loss basis, meaning that its exposure only arises after the ceding
company’s accumulated losses have exceeded the attachment point of the reinsurance policy. ACE Tempest Re Bermuda also writes other types of reinsurance on a limited basis for selected clients. Examples include proportional property where the
reinsurer shares a proportional part of the premiums and losses of the ceding company and per risk excess of loss treaty reinsurance where coverage applies on a per risk basis rather than per event or aggregate basis, together with casualty and
specialty lines (catastrophe workers’ compensation, crop and terrorism). ACE Tempest Re Bermuda’s business is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.



ACE Tempest Re USA writes all lines of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance
for the U.S. market, principally on a treaty basis, with a focus on writing property per risk and casualty reinsurance. ACE Tempest Re USA underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis. This unit’s diversified
portfolio is produced through reinsurance intermediaries.



ACE Tempest Re
International provides P&C treaty reinsurance to insurance companies worldwide, with emphasis on non-U.S. and Canadian risks. ACE Tempest Re International writes all lines of traditional and specialty reinsurance including property risk and
property catastrophe, casualty, marine, and aviation, through our London- and Zurich-based divisions. The London-based divisions of ACE Tempest Re International focus on the development of business sourced through London market brokers and,
consequently, write a diverse book of international business using Syndicate 2488 and AEGL. The Zurich-based division focuses on providing reinsurance to continental European insurers via continental European brokers. ACE Tempest Re International
also includes our Shanghai, China office which provides reinsurance coverage for Chinese-based risks and our Sao Paulo, Brazil office which provides reinsurance for Brazilian-based risks. ACE Tempest Re International underwrites reinsurance on both
a proportional and excess of loss basis.



ACE Tempest Re Canada offers a
full array of traditional and specialty P&C reinsurance to the Canadian market, including casualty, property risk and property catastrophe. ACE Tempest Re Canada provides its coverage through its Canadian company platform and also offers its
clients access to Syndicate 2488. ACE Tempest Re Canada underwrites reinsurance on both a proportional and excess of loss basis.



Competitive Environment

The Global Reinsurance
segment competes worldwide with major U.S. and non-U.S. reinsurers as well as reinsurance departments of numerous multi-line insurance organizations. Over the last several years, capital markets participants have developed financial products
intended to compete with traditional reinsurance. In addition, government sponsored or backed catastrophe funds can affect demand for reinsurance. Global Reinsurance is considered a lead reinsurer and is typically involved in the negotiation and
quotation of the terms and conditions of the majority of the contracts in which it participates. Global Reinsurance competes effectively in P&C markets worldwide because of its strong capital position, analytical capabilities and quality service
provided to customers, the leading role it plays in setting the terms, pricing, and conditions in negotiating contracts, and its customized approach to risk selection. The key competitors in our markets vary by geographic region and product line. An
advantage of our international platform is that we are able to change our mix of business in response to changes in competitive conditions in the territories in which we operate. Our geographic reach is also sought by multinational ceding companies
since all of our offices, with the exception of Bermuda, provide local reinsurance license capabilities which benefit our clients in dealing with country regulators.







Life



Overview

Life, which accounted for 11 percent
of 2011 consolidated net premiums earned, includes ACE’s international life operations (ACE Life), ACE Tempest Life Re (ACE Life Re), and the North American supplemental A&H and life business of Combined Insurance.



Products and Distribution



ACE Life Re’s core business is a Bermuda-based operation which provides reinsurance to primary life insurers, focusing on guarantees included in certain fixed
and variable annuity products and also on more traditional mortality reinsurance protection. ACE Life Re’s U.S.-based traditional life reinsurance operation was discontinued for new business in January 2010. Since 2007, ACE Life Re has not
quoted on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace and our focus has been on successfully managing the current portfolio of risk, both in the aggregate and on a contract basis. This business is managed with a long-term
perspective and short-term earnings volatility is expected.



Combined
Insurance distributes specialty individual accident and supplemental health and life insurance products targeted to middle income consumers in the U.S. and Canada. Combined Insurance’s substantial North American sales force distributes a wide
range of supplemental accident and sickness insurance products, including personal accident, short-term disability, critical illness, Medicare supplement products, and hospital confinement/recovery. Most of these products are primarily
fixed-indemnity benefit obligations and are not subject to escalating medical cost inflation.



Competitive Environment

ACE Life’s competition differs by location but generally includes
multinational insurers, and in some locations, local insurers, joint ventures, or state-owned insurers. ACE’s financial strength and reputation as an entrepreneurial organization with a global presence gives ACE Life a strong base from which to
compete. While ACE Life Re is not currently quoting on new opportunities in the variable annuity reinsurance marketplace, we continue to monitor developments in this market. Combined Insurance competes for A&H business in the U.S. against
numerous A&H and life insurance companies across various industry segments.









Underwriting

ACE is an underwriting company and we strive to emphasize quality of underwriting rather than volume of business or market share. Our underwriting strategy is to
manage risk by employing consistent, disciplined pricing and risk selection. This, coupled with our holdings of less cyclical product lines, has helped us develop flexibility and stability of our business, and has allowed us to maintain a profitable
book of business throughout market cycles. Clearly defined underwriting authorities, standards, and guidelines are in place in each of our local operations and global profit centers. Global product boards ensure consistency of approach and the
establishment of best practices throughout the world. Our priority is to help ensure adherence to criteria for risk selection by maintaining high levels of experience and expertise in our underwriting staff. In addition, we employ a business review
structure that helps ensure control of risk quality and conservative use of policy limits and terms and conditions. Underwriting discipline is at the heart of our operating philosophy.



Qualified actuaries in each region work closely with the underwriting teams to provide additional expertise in the underwriting process.
We use sophisticated catastrophe loss and risk modeling techniques designed to ensure appropriate spread of risk and to analyze correlation of risk across different product lines and territories. This helps to ensure that losses are contained within
our risk tolerance and appetite for individual product lines, businesses, and ACE as a whole. We also purchase reinsurance as a tool to diversify risk and limit the net loss potential of catastrophes and large or unusually hazardous risks. For
additional information refer to “Reinsurance Protection”, below, “Insurance and Reinsurance Markets”, under Item 1A, “Catastrophe Management” and “Natural Catastrophe Property Reinsurance Program”, under
Item 7, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Reinsurance Protection



A separate policy and process exists for captive reinsurance companies. Generally,
these reinsurance companies are established by our clients or our clients have an interest in them. It is generally our policy to obtain collateral equal to the expected losses that may be ceded to the captive. Where appropriate, exceptions to the
collateral requirement are granted but only after senior management review. Specific collateral guidelines and an exception process are in place for ACE USA and Insurance – Overseas General, both of which have credit management units evaluating
the captive’s credit quality and that of their parent company. The credit management units, working with actuaries, determine reasonable exposure estimates (collateral calculations), ensure receipt of collateral in an acceptable form, and
coordinate collateral adjustments as and when needed. Currently, financial reviews and expected loss evaluations are performed annually for active captive accounts and as needed for run-off exposures. In addition to collateral, parental
guarantees are often used to enhance the credit quality of the captive.



In
general, we seek to place our reinsurance with highly rated companies with which we have a strong trading relationship. For more information refer to “Catastrophe Management” and “Natural Catastrophe Property Reinsurance Program”
under Item 7, and Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.









Unpaid Losses and Loss Expenses



During the loss settlement period, which can be many years in duration, additional facts regarding individual claims and trends often will become known. As these
become apparent, case reserves may be adjusted by allocation from IBNR without any change in the overall reserve. In addition, the circumstances of individual claims or the application of statistical and actuarial methods to loss experience data may
lead to the adjustment of the overall reserves upward or downward from time to time. Accordingly, the ultimate settlement of losses may be significantly greater than or less than reported loss and loss expense reserves.



We have considered asbestos and environmental (A&E) claims and claims expenses in
establishing the liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses and have developed reserving methods which consider historical experience as well as incorporate new sources of data to estimate the ultimate losses arising from A&E exposures. The
reserves for A&E claims and claims expenses represent management’s best estimate of future loss and loss expense payments and recoveries that are expected to develop over the next several decades. We continuously monitor evolving case law
and its effect on environmental and latent injury claims, we monitor A&E claims activity quarterly, and we perform a full reserve review annually.



For each product line, management, in conjunction with internal actuaries, develops a “best estimate” of the ultimate settlement value of the unpaid
losses and loss expenses that it believes provides a reasonable estimate of the required reserve. We evaluate our estimates of reserves quarterly in light of developing information. While we are unable at this time to determine whether additional
reserves may be necessary in the future, we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses are adequate at December 31, 2011. Future additions to reserves, if needed, could have a material adverse effect upon our financial
condition, results of operations, and cash flows.



For more information
refer to “Critical Accounting Estimates – Unpaid losses and loss expenses”, under Item 7 and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



The “Analysis of Losses and Loss Expenses Development” table shown below presents, for each balance sheet date over the period
2001-2011, the gross and net loss and loss expense reserves recorded at the balance sheet date and subsequent net payments on the associated liabilities. The reserves represent the amount required for the estimated future settlement value of
liabilities incurred at or prior to the balance sheet date and those estimates may change subsequent to the balance sheet date as new information emerges regarding the ultimate settlement value of the liability. Accordingly, the table also presents
through December 31, 2011, for each balance sheet date, the cumulative impact of subsequent valuations of the liabilities incurred at the original balance sheet date. The data in the table is presented in accordance with reporting requirements
of the SEC. This table should be interpreted with care by those not familiar with its format or those who are familiar with other triangulations arranged by origin year of loss such as accident or underwriting year rather than balance sheet date, as
shown below. To clarify the interpretation of the table, we use the reserves established at December 31, 2001, in the following example.



The top two lines of the table show, for successive balance sheet dates, the gross and net unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded as provision for liabilities
incurred at or prior to each balance sheet date. It can be seen that at December 31, 2001, a reserve of $10.6 billion net of reinsurance had been established.







The upper (paid) triangulation presents the net amounts paid as of periods subsequent to the balance sheet date. Hence
in the 2002 financial year, $2.7 billion of payments were made on liabilities contemplated in the December 31, 2001, reserve balance. At the end of the 2011 financial year, there were cumulative net payments of $9.2 billion on this block of
liabilities.



The lower triangulation within the table shows the revised
estimate of the net liability originally recorded at each balance sheet date as of the end of subsequent financial years. With the benefit of actual loss emergence and hindsight over the intervening period, the net liabilities incurred as of
December 31, 2001, are now estimated to be $13.2 billion, rather than the original estimate of $10.6 billion. One of the key drivers of this change has been adverse development on latent claims that we categorize as A&E covered under the
National Indemnity Company (NICO) reinsurance treaties. Of the cumulative deficiency of $2.6 billion recognized in the ten years since December 31, 2001, $1.2 billion relates to non-latent claims and $1.4 billion relates to latent claims. The
deficiency of $2.6 billion was identified and recorded as follows: $727 million deficient in 2002, $208 million deficient in 2003, $989 million deficient in 2004, $184 million deficient in 2005, $155 million deficient in 2006, $133 million deficient
in 2007, $86 million deficient in 2008, $11 million deficient in 2009, $36 million redundant in 2010, and $126 million deficient in 2011.



Importantly, the cumulative deficiency or redundancy for different balance sheet dates are not independent and, therefore, should not be added together. In the last
year, we revised our estimate of the December 31, 2001, liabilities from $13.1 billion to $13.2 billion. This adverse development of $126 million will also be included in each column to the right of the December 31, 2001, column to
recognize that this additional amount was also required in the reserves established for each annual balance sheet date from December 31, 2002, to December 31, 2011.



The loss development table shows that our original estimate of the net unpaid loss and
loss expense requirement at December 31, 2010, of $25.2 billion has, with the benefit of actual loss emergence and hindsight, been revised to $24.7 billion at December 31, 2011. This favorable movement of $556 million is referred to as
prior period development and is the net result of a number of underlying movements both favorable and adverse. The key underlying movements are discussed in more detail within the “Prior Period Development” section of Item 7.



The bottom lines of the table show the re-estimated amount of previously
recorded gross liabilities at December 31, 2011, together with the change in reinsurance recoverable. Similar to the net liabilities, the cumulative redundancy or deficiency on the gross liability is the difference between the gross liability
originally recorded and the re-estimated gross liability at December 31, 2011. For example, with respect to the gross unpaid loss and loss expenses of $20.9 billion for December 31, 2001, this gross liability was re-estimated to be $28.9
billion at December 31, 2011, resulting in the cumulative deficiency on the gross liability originally recorded for the 2001 balance sheet year of $7.9 billion. This deficiency relates primarily to U.S. liabilities, including A&E
liabilities for 1996 and prior. The gross deficiency results in a net deficiency of $2.6 billion after consideration of substantial reinsurance coverage that reduces the gross loss; approximately $4.0 billion was covered by reinsurance placed when
the risks were originally written and $1.3 billion and $95 million of the remaining insurance coverage has been ceded under the Brandywine NICO Agreement and Westchester NICO Agreement, respectively.



We do not consider it appropriate to extrapolate future deficiencies or redundancies
based upon the table, as conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily recur in the future. We believe that our current estimates of net liabilities appropriately reflect our current
knowledge of the business profile and the prevailing market, social, legal, and economic conditions while giving due consideration to historical trends and volatility evidenced in our markets over the longer term. The key issues and
considerations involved in establishing our estimate of the net liabilities are discussed in more detail within the “Critical Accounting Estimates – Unpaid losses and loss expenses” section of Item 7.



On April 1, 2008, we acquired Combined Insurance. On December 1, 2010, we
acquired Jerneh Insurance Berhad. On December 28, 2010, we acquired all of the outstanding commons stock of Rain and Hail not previously owned by us. We acquired PMHC and Rio Guayas on November 30, 2011 and December 28, 2011,
respectively. The unpaid loss information for these acquisitions has been included in the table commencing in the year of acquisition.

Investments

Our objective is to maximize investment income and total return while ensuring an appropriate level of liquidity, investment quality and diversification. As such, ACE’s investment portfolio is invested
primarily in investment-grade fixed-income securities as measured by the major rating agencies. We do not allow leverage or complex credit structures in our investment portfolio.



The critical aspects of the investment process are controlled by ACE Asset Management,
an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ACE. These aspects include asset allocation, portfolio and guideline design, risk management and oversight of external asset managers. In this regard, ACE Asset Management:



• conducts formal asset allocation modeling for each of the ACE subsidiaries,
providing formal recommendations for the portfolio’s structure;



• establishes recommended investment guidelines that are appropriate to the prescribed asset allocation targets;



• provides the analysis, evaluation, and selection of our external investment
advisors;



• establishes and develops investment-related analytics to
enhance portfolio engineering and risk control;



• monitors and
aggregates the correlated risk of the overall investment portfolio; and



• provides governance over the investment process for each of our operating companies to ensure consistency of approach and adherence to investment guidelines.



Under our guidance and direction, external asset managers conduct security
and sector selection and transaction execution. This use of multiple managers benefits ACE in several ways – it provides us with operational and cost efficiencies, diversity of styles and approaches, innovations in investment research and
credit and risk management, all of which enhance the risk adjusted returns of our portfolios.









ACE Asset Management determines the investment portfolio’s allowable, targeted asset allocation and ranges for
each of the operating segments. These asset allocation targets are derived from sophisticated asset and liability modeling that measures correlated histories of returns and volatility of returns. Allowable investment classes are further refined
through analysis of our operating environment, including expected volatility of cash flows, potential impact on our capital position, as well as regulatory and rating agency considerations.



Under the overall supervision of the Risk & Finance Committee of the Board, ACE’s governance over investment management is
rigorous and ongoing. Among its responsibilities, the Risk & Finance Committee of the Board:



• reviews and approves asset allocation targets and investment policy to ensure that it is consistent with our overall goals, strategies, and objectives;



• reviews and approves investment guidelines to ensure that appropriate levels of
portfolio liquidity, credit quality, diversification, and volatility are maintained; and



• systematically reviews the portfolio’s exposures including any potential violations of investment guidelines.



We have long-standing global credit limits for our entire portfolio across the organization and for individual obligors. Exposures are aggregated, monitored, and
actively managed by our Global Credit Committee, comprised of senior executives, including our Chief Financial Officer, our Chief Risk Officer, our Chief Investment Officer, and our Treasurer. Additionally, the Board has established a
Risk & Finance Committee which helps execute the Board’s supervisory responsibilities pertaining to enterprise risk management including investment risk.



Within the guidelines and asset allocation parameters established by the
Risk & Finance Committee, individual investment committees of the operating segments determine tactical asset allocation. Additionally, these committees review all investment-related activity that affects their operating company, including
the selection of outside investment advisors, proposed asset allocations changes, and the systematic review of investment guidelines.



For additional information regarding the investment portfolio, including breakdowns of the sector and maturity distributions, refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Regulation

Our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries conduct business globally, including all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia. Our businesses in
each of these jurisdictions are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision. The laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled require among other things that these
subsidiaries maintain minimum levels of statutory capital, surplus and liquidity, meet solvency standards, and submit to periodic examinations of their financial condition. The complex regulatory environments in which ACE operates are subject to
change and are regularly monitored. The following is an overview discussion of regulations for our operations in Switzerland, the U.S., Bermuda, and other international locations.



Swiss Operations

The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, which we refer to as “FINMA”, has the discretion to supervise our group activities. Under so-called “group supervision,” FINMA has the right to
supervise ACE on a group-wide basis. The regulatory power of FINMA covers in particular the following areas:



• reporting on organization;



• reporting on structure;



• reporting on internal transactions;



• solvency;



• group/conglomerate report; and



• corporate governance/risk management/internal control system.



In 2008, we received written confirmation from the Federal Office of Private Insurance (FOPI), a FINMA predecessor insurance supervising authority, that it does not
intend to subject us to group supervision so long as certain business parameters within Switzerland are not exceeded. From time to time, we may exceed these parameters. While we cannot assure that FINMA will







not change these parameters or otherwise begin to exercise group supervision over us, we do not presently foresee becoming subject to such group supervision at ACE’s current or anticipated
business levels in Switzerland. However, the costs and administrative burdens of group supervision, should we be subjected to it, could be substantial.



In 2008, we formed ACE Insurance (Switzerland) Limited which offers various insurance covers to small and mid-sized Swiss companies, as well as A&H solutions to
individuals. We have also formed a reinsurance subsidiary named ACE Reinsurance (Switzerland) Limited which we operate as primarily a provider of reinsurance to other ACE entities. Both new companies are licensed and governed by FINMA.



U.S. Operations

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by the states in which they do business. The laws of the various states establish departments of insurance with broad authority to
regulate, among other things: the standards of solvency that must be met and maintained, the licensing of insurers and their producers, approval of policy forms and rates, the nature of and limitations on investments, restrictions on the size of the
risks which may be insured under a single policy, deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders, requirements for the acceptability of reinsurers, periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies, the form and content of reports
of financial condition required to be filed, and the adequacy of reserves for unearned premiums, losses, and other purposes.



Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual and quarterly reports with state insurance regulators in each of the states in which they do
business. In addition, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ operations and financial records are subject to examination at regular intervals by state regulators.



All states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding companies. This
legislation provides that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the insurance department of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may
materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a holding company system must be fair and equitable. Notice to the insurance departments is required prior to the
consummation of transactions affecting the ownership or control of an insurer and of certain material transactions between an insurer and an entity in its holding company system. In addition, certain transactions may not be consummated without the
department’s prior approval.



Statutory surplus is an important
measure utilized by the regulators and rating agencies to assess our U.S. insurance subsidiaries’ ability to support business operations and provide dividend capacity. Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to various state statutory and
regulatory restrictions that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval from regulatory authorities. These restrictions differ by state, but are generally based on calculations incorporating statutory surplus, statutory
net income, and/or investment income.



The National Association of
Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has a risk-based capital requirement for P&C insurance companies. This risk-based capital formula is used by many state regulatory authorities to identify insurance companies that may be undercapitalized and which
merit further regulatory attention. These requirements are designed to monitor capital adequacy using a formula that prescribes a series of risk measurements to determine a minimum capital amount for an insurance company, based on the profile of the
individual company. The ratio of a company’s actual policyholder surplus to its minimum capital requirement will determine whether any state regulatory action is required. There are progressive risk-based capital failure levels that trigger
more stringent regulatory action. If an insurer’s policyholders’ surplus falls below the Mandatory Control Level (70 percent of the Authorized Control Level, as defined by the NAIC), the relevant insurance commissioner is required to place
the insurer under regulatory control. However, an insurance commissioner may allow a P&C company operating below the Mandatory Control Level that is writing no business and is running off its existing business to continue its run-off. Brandywine
is running off its liabilities consistent with the terms of an order issued by the Insurance Commissioner of Pennsylvania. This includes periodic reporting obligations to the Pennsylvania Insurance Department.



Government intervention has also occurred in the insurance and reinsurance markets in
relation to terrorism coverage in the U.S. (and through industry initiatives in other countries). The U.S. Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), which was enacted in 2002 to ensure the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist
acts in the U.S., was extended in 2007 for seven years, through 2014, and applies to certain of our operations.



From time to time, ACE and its subsidiaries and affiliates receive inquiries from state agencies and attorneys general, with which we generally comply, seeking information concerning business practices, such as
underwriting and non-traditional or loss mitigation insurance products. Moreover, many recent factors, such as consequences of and reactions to industry and







economic conditions and focus on domestic issues, have contributed to the potential for change in the legal and regulatory framework applicable to ACE’s U.S. operations and businesses. We
cannot assure that changes in laws or investigative or enforcement activities in the various U.S states will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or business practices. More information on insurance
industry investigations, including settlement agreements and related matters, is set forth in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, under Item 8.



Bermuda Operations

The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda and related regulations, as amended (the Insurance Act), regulates the insurance business of our Bermuda insurance subsidiaries and provides that no person may carry on any
insurance business in or from within Bermuda unless registered as an insurer by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA). The Insurance Act makes no distinction between insurance and reinsurance business. The Insurance Act imposes solvency and liquidity
standards and auditing and reporting requirements on Bermuda insurance companies and grants the BMA powers to supervise, investigate, and intervene in the affairs of insurance companies.



In 2008, the Bermuda insurance supervisory framework underwent major revision with the passage of the Insurance Amendment Act 2008 (the
Amendment Act). The Amendment Act established new risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin requirements for Bermuda insurers.



Our Bermuda domiciled insurance subsidiaries must prepare annual statutory financial statements and file them with the BMA, and certain subsidiaries must file
audited annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP), International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), or any such other generally accepted accounting principles as the BMA
may recognize. These audited financials are made public by the BMA. The Insurance Act prescribes rules for the preparation and content of the statutory financial statements and are distinct from the financial statements prepared for presentation to
an insurer’s shareholders under the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda (the Companies Act). These ACE subsidiaries are required to give detailed information and analyses regarding premiums, claims, reinsurance and investments.



Under the new regulatory framework, the BMA has promulgated the Insurance (Prudential
Standards) (Class 4 Solvency Requirement) Order 2008 (the Order) which, inter alia, mandates that a Class 4 insurer’s Enhanced Capital Requirement (ECR) be calculated by either (a) the model set out in Schedule 1 to the Order, or
(b) an internal capital model which the BMA has approved for use for this purpose. ACE’s Bermuda Class 4 insurance subsidiaries use the BMA model in calculating their solvency requirements.



During 2011, the BMA also issued the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 4 and
Class 3B Solvency Requirement) Amendment Rules 2011, Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class E Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011 and the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 3A Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011.



The Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 4 and Class 3B Solvency Requirement)
Amendment Rules 2011 amends the Order for Class 4 companies issued in 2008. The Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class E Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011 and the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Class 3A Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011 require
that as of December 31, 2011, Class E (long term business) companies and Class 3A (general business) companies follow similar rules as those set out above for Class 4 companies.



The new risk-based regulatory capital adequacy and solvency margin regime provides a risk-based capital model (termed the Bermuda
Solvency Capital Requirement (BSCR)) as a tool to assist the BMA both in measuring risk and in determining appropriate levels of capitalization. The BSCR employs a standard mathematical model that correlates the risk underwritten by Bermuda insurers
to the capital that is dedicated to their business. The framework that has been developed applies a standard measurement format to the risk associated with an insurer’s assets, liabilities, and premiums, including a formula to take account of
catastrophe risk exposure. In order to minimize the risk of a shortfall in capital arising from an unexpected adverse deviation and in moving towards the implementation of a risk-based capital approach, the BMA requires that insurers operate at or
above a threshold capital level (termed the Target Capital Level (TCL)), which exceeds the BSCR or approved internal model minimum amounts.



These capital requirements require that Class 4, 3B and 3A insurers hold available statutory capital and surplus equal to or exceeding ECR and set TCL at 120
percent of ECR. The BMA also has a degree of discretion enabling it to impose ECR on insurers in particular cases, for instance where an insurer falls below the TCL. While they must calculate its ECR annually by reference to either the BSCR or an
approved internal model, Class 4, 3B and 3A insurers must also ensure that, at all times, its ECR is at least equal to minimum solvency margins as prescribed on the regulations. Similar rules now apply to Class E long term insurers, but they are
being phased in over three years.







Under the Insurance Act, Class 4 and 3B insurers are prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends of more than 25
percent of its total statutory capital and surplus, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividends it files with the BMA an affidavit that it will continue to meet its
required solvency margins. In addition, Class 4, 3B or E insurers must obtain the BMA’s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital, as shown in its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, by 15 percent or more.
Furthermore, under the Companies Act, the Bermuda insurance subsidiaries may only declare and pay a dividend from retained earnings, and a dividend or distribution from contributed surplus if it has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or
would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would not be less than the aggregate of its liabilities and its issued share capital and share premium accounts.



Other International Operations

The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which the non-U.S. ACE operations conduct business. While each country imposes
licensing, solvency, auditing, and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. For example:



• in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file quarterly financial reports, and in others, only annual reports;



• some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance
products, whereas other regulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;



• the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;



• policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;



• the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country; and



• regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.



Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure, and
resources of the local regulatory departments that oversee insurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-based approach.



ACE operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through
branches of subsidiaries. Local capital requirements applicable to a subsidiary generally include its branches. Certain ACE companies are jointly owned with local companies to comply with legal requirements for local ownership. Other legal
requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, compulsory cessions of reinsurance, local retention of funds and records, data privacy and protection program requirements, and foreign exchange controls. ACE’s international companies
are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.



There
are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact ACE in multiple international jurisdictions and the potential for significant impact on ACE could be heightened as a result of recent industry and economic developments. In particular, the
European Union’s (EU) executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations for the European insurance industry, known as Solvency II, which aims to establish a revised set of EU-wide
capital requirements and risk management standards that will replace the current Solvency I requirements. Once finalized, Solvency II is expected to set out new, strengthened requirements applicable to the entire EU relating to capital adequacy and
risk management for insurers. Other jurisdictions such as Bermuda, Switzerland, and U.S. are also seeking changes in their respective capital and risk management requirements.



Enterprise Risk Management

As an insurer, ACE is in the
business of profitably managing risk for its customers. Since risk management must permeate an organization conducting a global insurance business, we have an established Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) framework that is integrated into management
of our businesses and is led by ACE’s senior management. As a result, ERM is a part of the day-to-day management of ACE and its operations.



Our global ERM framework is broadly multi-disciplinary and its objectives include:



• support core risk management responsibilities at division and corporate levels
through the identification and management of risks that aggregate and/or correlate across divisions;







• identify, analyze, and mitigate significant external risks that could impair the financial condition of ACE
and/or hinder its business objectives;



• coordinate accumulation
guidelines and actual exposure relative to guidelines, risk codes, and other risk processes;



• provide analysis and maintain accumulation and economic capital and information systems that enable business leaders to make appropriate and consistent risk/return decisions;



• identify and assess emerging risk issues; and



• develop and communicate to our business lines consistent risk management
processes.



ACE’s Enterprise Risk Management Board (ERMB) reports to
and assists the Chief Executive Officer in the oversight and review of the ERM framework which covers the processes and guidelines used to manage insurance risk, financial risk, strategic risk, and operational risk. The ERMB is chaired by ACE’s
Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. The ERMB meets at least monthly, and is comprised of ACE’s most senior executives, in addition to the Chair: the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Claims
Officer, General Counsel, Chief Executive Officer for Insurance – North America, Chief Executive Officer for ACE Overseas General, and our Chief Executive Officer for Global Reinsurance.



The ERMB is provided support from various sources, including the Enterprise Risk Unit (ERU) and Product Boards. The ERU is responsible
for the collation and analysis of two types of information. First, external information that provides insight to the ERMB on risks that might significantly impact ACE’s key objectives and second, internal risk aggregations from its business
writings and other activities such as investments. The ERU is independent of the operating units and reports to our Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary. The Product Boards exist to provide oversight for products that we offer globally. A Product
Board currently exists for each of the following products; property/energy, marine, casualty, professional lines, aviation, and political risk. Each Product Board is responsible for ensuring consistency in underwriting and pricing standards,
identification of emerging issues, and guidelines for relevant accumulations.



ACE’s Chief Risk Officer and Chief Actuary also reports to the Board’s Risk & Finance Committee, which helps execute the Board’s supervisory responsibilities pertaining to ERM. The role of
the Risk & Finance Committee includes evaluation of the integrity and effectiveness of our ERM procedures and systems and information; governance on major policy decisions pertaining to risk aggregation and minimization, and assessment of
our major decisions and preparedness levels pertaining to perceived material risks. The Audit Committee, which regularly meets with the Risk & Finance Committee, provides oversight of the financial reporting process and safeguarding of
assets.



Others within the ERM structure contribute toward accomplishing
ACE’s ERM objectives, including regional management, Internal Audit, Compliance, external consultants, and managers of our internal control processes and procedures.
