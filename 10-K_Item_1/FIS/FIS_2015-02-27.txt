Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs more than 40,000 people worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing and banking solutions. Through our Capco brand, we deliver globally a wide range of information technology consulting, advisory and transformational services to financial institutions.

FIS is incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "FIS".



We help clients address and solve their critical and challenging business and technology problems by leveraging the breadth and depth of our software applications and services, our collective experience, our broad range of successful methodologies and our global scale.  We have grown organically as well as through acquisitions, which have contributed applications and service expansion capabilities that complement or enhance our existing offerings and diversify our revenues by clients, geography and service offering.  These acquired offerings include integrated consulting services, integrated core banking and payment solutions, mobile banking solutions, wealth management services,  item processing services, card issuer services, risk management solutions, electronic loan amendment applications and services, electronic funds transfer ("EFT") services, and prepaid/gift card processing for all sizes of financial institutions, including community banks and credit unions.  Many of these solutions are also sold to other commercial businesses. These strategic acquisitions have enabled us to broaden our available solution sets, scale our operations, develop our global consulting expertise, expand and diversify our client base and strengthen our competitive position.  We continue to invest in our solutions and services, looking to innovate and enhance them to deliver more value to our clients.



Financial Information About Operating Segments and Geographic Areas



During the periods presented, we operated our business in four reporting segments: 1) Financial Solutions Group (“FSG”); 2) Payment Solutions Group (“PSG”); 3) International Solutions Group (“ISG”); and 4) Corporate and Other.  In December 2014, we announced the promotion of Gary Norcross to Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2015.  In 2015, we have made a number of other organizational changes designed to align our services and solutions with their best market opportunity.  How we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new structure may result in a change in our reportable segments.



Competitive Strengths



We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:



•Brand— FIS has built a global brand known for market leading solutions, innovation and thought leadership in the financial services sector.  Capco likewise has a strong brand in integrated consulting and advisory technology strategy and services in this sector.

•Global Reach, Distribution and Scale —Our worldwide presence, breadth and depth of solution offerings, client diversity, established infrastructure and employee skills and competencies enable us to leverage our client relationships and global scale to drive revenue growth and operating efficiency.   We are a global leader in the primary markets we serve, supported by a large, knowledgeable talent pool of employees around the world.

•Extensive Domain Expertise and Portfolio Depth— FIS has a significant number and wide range of high-quality software applications and service offerings that have been developed over many years with substantial input from our clients.  We leverage our industry and technology knowledge and experience to tailor these applications and service offerings to deliver comprehensive business solutions that address  specific  needs of our clients and our clients' customers.  These solutions include a wide range of flexible service arrangements for the deployment and support of our software, from cloud-based offerings to managed processing arrangements to traditional license and maintenance









approaches, either at the client’s site or at an FIS location.  Our broad solution set allows us to bundle tailored and/or integrated solutions to compete effectively. In addition, FIS is able to use the modular nature of our software applications and our ability to integrate many of our applications and services with the solutions of others to provide customized solutions that respond to individualized client  needs.  We understand the needs of our clients and their customers and have developed innovative solutions that we believe give them a competitive advantage, reducing their operating costs and improving their productivity.

•Excellent Relationship with Clients— Our client-centered approach has enabled us to establish deep and long-lasting client relationships.   A significant percentage of FIS’ services are provided under multi-year, recurring contracts, which allows us to develop close partnerships with these clients resulting in high client retention rates.  As the breadth and value proposition of FIS’ service offerings has expanded, our access to our clients’ executives and their interest in our solutions and services has increased, presenting greater opportunities for cross-selling and upselling broader integrated solutions to them.

Strategy



Our mission is to provide our clients with superior solutions and services, which we believe will assist our clients in their respective marketplaces and will result in sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strategy to achieve this goal has been and continues to be built on the following pillars:



•Support Our Clients Through Transformation— Changing market dynamics, particularly in the areas of information security, regulation and innovation, are transforming the way our clients operate, which is driving incremental demand for our leveraged solutions and consulting expertise.  As clients evaluate technology, business process changes and vendor risks, our depth of services capabilities enables us to become involved earlier in their planning and design process and assist them as they manage through these changes.

•Expand Client Relationships—  The overall marketwe servecontinues to gravitate beyond single-product purchases to multi-solution partnerships.  As the market dynamics shift, our clients may rely more on our multidimensional, integrated service offerings.  Our leveraged solutions and processing expertise, along with our consulting and advisory services, can produce meaningful value and cost savings for our clients through more efficient operating processes, improved experience and service quality and convenience for our clients' customers.

•Build , Buy, or Partner to Add Solutions to Cross-Sell— We continue to invest in growth through internal product development, as well as through product-focused or market-centric acquisitions and equity investments that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities, providing us with additional solutions to cross-sell.  We also partner from time to time with other entities to provide comprehensive offerings to our clients.  By investing in solution innovation and integration, we continue to expand our value proposition to clients.

•Continually Improve to Drive Margin Expansion— We strive to optimize our performance through investments in infrastructure enhancements, our workforce and other measures that are designed to create organic revenue and margin expansion.

•Build Global Diversification—  We continue to deploy resources in global markets where we expect to achieve meaningful scale.

Financial Solutions Group



The focus of FSG is to provide comprehensive services and software to satisfy the processing, technology,  and outsourcing needs of our financial institution clients in North America. We service the core and related ancillary processing









needs of North American banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies, commercial lenders, and independent community and savings institutions. The FSG segment offers a broad selection of in-house and outsourced solutions to banking clients that span the range of asset sizes. FSG clients typically commit to multi-year contracts that provide a stable, recurring revenue base and opportunities for cross-selling additional financial and payments offerings.



We employ several business models to provide our solutions to our clients. We typically deliver the highest value to our clients when we combine our software applications and deliver them in one of several types of outsourcing arrangements, such as cloud-based provider, application service provider, through facilities management processing or by an application management arrangement. We are also able to deliver individual applications through a software licensing arrangement. Based upon our expertise gained through the foregoing arrangements, some clients also retain us to manage their IT operations with or without using any of our proprietary software.  We also provide strategic consulting services that help financial institutions define and manage their technology strategies and projects.



Our solutions in this segment include:



•Core Processing and Ancillary Applications.Our core processing software applications are designed to run banking processes for our financial institution clients, including deposit and lending systems, customer management, and other central management systems, serving as the system of record for processed activity.  Our diverse selection of market-focused core systems enables FIS to compete effectively in a wide range of markets. We also offer a number of services that are ancillary to the primary applications listed above, including branch automation, back office support systems and compliance support. In addition, our wealth management services address the specific needs of the affluent markets as well as commercial clients.  We also offer an application suite that assists automotive finance institutions in evaluating loan applications and credit risk and managing their loan and lease portfolios.



•Channel Solutions, including Internet, Mobile and eBanking.Our comprehensive suite of retail banking delivery applications enables financial institutions to integrate and streamline customer-facing operations and back-office processes, thereby improving customer interaction across all channels (e.g., branch offices, Internet, ATM, Mobile, call centers). FIS' focus on consumer access has driven significant market innovation in this area, with multi-channel and multi-host solutions and a strategy that provides tight integration of services and a seamless customer experience. FIS is a leader in mobile banking solutions and electronic banking enabling clients to manage banking and payments through the Internet, mobile devices and telephone. Our corporate electronic banking solutions provide commercial treasury capabilities including cash management services and multi-bank collection and disbursement services that address the specialized needs of corporate clients. FIS systems provide full accounting and reconciliation for such transactions, serving here also as the system of record.



•Fraud, Risk Management and Compliance Solutions.Our decision solutions offer a spectrum of options that cover the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account applicants to managing existing customer accounts and fraud. Our applications include know-your-customer, new account decisioning and opening, account and transaction management, fraud management and collections. Our risk management services use our proprietary risk management models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new account or accepting a check at either the point-of-sale, a physical branch location, or through the Internet. Our systems use a combination of advanced authentication procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit transactions for financial institutions.  We also provide outsourced risk management and compliance solutions that are configurable to a client's regulatory and risk management requirements.



•Syndicated Lending.Our syndicated loan applications are designed to support wholesale and commercial banking requirements necessary for all aspects of syndicated commercial loan origination, amendment, trade and servicing.



•Global Commercial Services.As our clients address their financial, regulatory, growth and security challenges, there is an increased trend toward outsourcing. Our global commercial services include solutions, both onshore and offshore, designed to meet the technology challenges facing clients, large or small, including financial institutions and non-financial institutions. These solutions range in scope from consulting engagements to application development projects and from operations support for a single application to full management of information technology infrastructures. We also provide outsourcing teams to manage costs, improve operational efficiency and transform our clients' back office and customer service processes.



•Strategic Consulting Services.Capco's North American operations are included in FSG.  Capco provides complex integrated consulting and advisory, technology and large-scale IT transformation services to financial institutions.









Capco consultants work with financial institutions to design and implement improvements in their information technology architecture, providing design, digital strategy consulting, program and change management and delivery services. Global financial institutions in particular can benefit from the combination of Capco's expertise with FIS' broad solution set as they transform in the evolving marketplace to restore customer confidence, reduce their cost structure and provide innovative solutions to their customers.

We offer Europay, MasterCard and VISA ("EMV") integrated circuit cards, often referred to as smart cards or chip cards, as well as a variety of stored-value card types and loyalty/reward programs.  Our integrated services range from card production and activation to processing to an extensive range of fraud management services and value-added loyalty programs designed to increase card usage and fee-based revenues for financial institutions and merchants.

International Solutions Group



ISG provides local services to our clients in more than 100 countries around the world. The services delivered by FIS in these locations include many of the same financial and payments solutions we offer in North America. We provide core banking applications, channel solutions, debit/credit/and prepaid card and merchant services, wealth management services, item processing and check risk management solutions to financial institutions, card issuers, commercial enterprises and government operations.



Banking and Payments Services.Our international operations leverage existing applications and provide services for the specific business needs of our clients in targeted international markets. Services are delivered from multiple operations centers around the world. Our payment solutions services include fully outsourced card-issuer services and customer support, payment processing and switching services, prepaid and debit card processing, item processing, software licensing and maintenance, outsourced ATM management and retail point-of-sale check warranty services. Our financial solutions services include fully outsourced core bank processing arrangements, application management, software licensing and maintenance and facilities management.



Strategic Consulting Services.Capco's operations outside of North America are included in ISG, providing the same integrated consulting described above under FSG.



ISG represented approximately22%of total2014revenues, with potential for both growth in existing client accounts and new account penetration.  Management believes the greatest potential for growth is in the Western European, Latin American and Asian markets.   Our Brazilian joint venture partner, Banco Bradesco, is our largest ISG client and was responsible for20%of ISG revenue in 2014 --See Related Party Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Corporate and Other Segment



The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate overhead and costs of leveraged functions that are not allocated to operating segments. These costs relate to domestic sales and marketing, finance and accounting, risk management and information security, human resources, legal, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates revenue generating segment performance.



Sales and Marketing



We see a trend in the buying behavior of financial services sector clients away from single products and toward integrated solutions that best suit a particular market of clients.  We have experienced sales personnel with expertise in particular services and markets as well as in the needs of particular types of clients. We believe that focusing our expertise in specific markets (e.g., global financial institutions, North American financial institutions) and tailoring integrated solution sets of particular value to participants in those markets will enable us to deliver better value to our clients and also help us leverage opportunities to cross-sell and up-sell. As a result, in 2014 we realigned our sales teams to better match our solution expertise with the market opportunity and client demand.  In 2014, we hired additional personnel with a specific focus on global financial institutions and









we expect to sustain and continue to invest in this market initiative.  We target the majority of our potential clients via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound lead generation and telesales efforts.



Our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the FSG, PSG, and ISG strategic marketing plans in support of their revenue and profitability goals and the FIS brand.  Key components include thought leadership, integrated programs with consistent message development, internal and external communications, client conference content management, web content creation and management, trade shows, demand generation campaigns  and collateral development and management.  We leverage our sales and marketing teams across North America, selling both PSG and FSG solutions.  Internationally, we have a regional sales and marketing coverage model.  For large strategic clients, we further designate an engagement partner to manage the relationship and identify sales opportunities.



Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property



The Company owns intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights and patents, that we believe are  important to our future success.  We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, copyrights and applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide. We rely on trademark law to protect our rights in those brands. We intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including by legal action when necessary and appropriate. In general, we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business, although we do license certain items from third parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms.



Competition



Our primary competitors include internal technology departments within financial institutions and retailers, data processing or software development departments of large companies or large computer manufacturers, companies that deliver software and integrated services to the financial services industry, third-party payment processors, independent computer services firms, companies that develop and deploy software applications, companies that provide customized development, implementation and support services, strategic consulting and technology consulting firms, and business process outsourcing companies. Some of these competitors possess greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Competitive factors impacting the success of our services include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, the ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services, price and overall relationship management. We believe that we compete favorably in each of these categories. In addition, we believe that our financial services industry expertise, combined with our ability to offer multiple applications, services and integrated solutions to individual clients, enhances our competitiveness against companies with more limited offerings.





Research and Development



Our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.











As part of our research and development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. In the case of nearly all of our third-party software, enterprise license agreements exist for the third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply.  As a result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party technology components. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints.  Additionally, third-party software may be used for commodity-type functions within a technology platform environment. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services. In each of the years endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012, approximately 2% to 3% of revenues were invested in research and development efforts.



Government Regulation



Our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, and foreign regulation, including federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices), privacy laws, usury laws, laws governing state trust charters, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The compliance of our services and applications with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors, including the manner in which our clients use them. Our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts. The failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them, as well as the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties. The principal areas of regulation impacting our business are:





•

Oversight by Banking  Regulators.



•Privacy.Our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves.



•Money Transfer.Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. These businesses may also be subject to certain state, local and tribal licensing requirements. The









Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction's banking department.



•Consumer Reporting and Protection.Our retail check authorization services (Certegy Check Services) and account opening services, including credit scoring analysis (ChexSystems) maintain databases of consumer information and, as a consequence, are subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws. Among other things, the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their files, to dispute their accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed information.  The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers’ personal information, and compliance with these laws, we strive to, and have made considerable investment to, maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling disputes.   We also are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect consumer's personal information in compliance with these laws.



The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted and signed into law on July 21, 2010.   Among other provisions, this legislation created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB"), whose sole focus is to develop, implement and, with respect to financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the CFPB, including enhanced oversight of non-financial institutions providing financial services.  For financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institution's primary federal regulator.  Certain of our businesses that affect end consumers are subject to examination by these regulators from time to time.



Our consumer reporting and facing businesses are subject to CFPB bulletin 2013-7 an update to the former Regulation A- Unfair Deceptive Acts or Practices, which states the definition of Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices (UDAAP).  This specific bulletin states that UDAAPs can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence, and undermine fair competition in the financial marketplace. Original creditors and other covered persons and service providers under the Dodd-Frank Act involved in collecting debt related to any consumer financial product or service are subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs in the Dodd-Frank Act.



•Debt Collection.Our collection services supporting our check, card and payment environments are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.



The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our Company is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously.  Enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.



Information Security



Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication.  Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public, sensitive information.  FIS is not immune to such attacks.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including but not limited to sensitive information of our clients and personal consumer data.  For more information on Information Security, see Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had approximately 40,000 employees, including approximately 25,000 employees principally employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is unionized. Approximately 11,000 of our employees, primarily in Brazil and Germany, are represented by labor unions or work councils. We consider our relations with employees to be good.
