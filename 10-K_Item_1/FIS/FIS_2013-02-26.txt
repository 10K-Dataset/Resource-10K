FIS is incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "FIS".



Our growth has been driven organically as well as through acquisitions, which have contributed critical applications that are complementary to or enhance existing offerings, including core banking solutions, outsourcing solutions for community banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions, item processing services, card issuer services, risk management solutions, electronic funds transfer ("EFT") services, and prepaid/gift card processing, including solutions for domestic companies, global organizations and for those domiciled outside of North America.  These strategic acquisitions have enabled us to quickly broaden our available solution offerings, scale our operations, expand our customer base and strengthen our competitive position.

Financial Solutions Group



The focus of FSG is to provide the most comprehensive software and services for the core processing, customer channel, treasury services, cash management, wealth management and capital market operations of our financial institution customers in North America. We service the core and related ancillary processing needs of North American banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies, commercial lenders, and independent community and savings institutions. FIS offers a broad selection of in-house and outsourced solutions to banking customers that span the range of asset sizes. FSG customers are typically committed under multi-year contracts that provide a stable, recurring revenue base and opportunities for cross-selling additional financial and payments offerings.



We employ several business models to provide our solutions to our customers. We typically deliver the highest value to our customers when we combine our software applications and deliver them in one of several types of outsourcing arrangements, such as an application service provider, facilities management processing or an application management arrangement. We are also able to deliver individual applications through a software licensing arrangement. Based upon our expertise gained through the foregoing arrangements, some clients also retain us to manage their IT operations without using any of our proprietary software.



Our solutions in this segment include:











•Core Processing and Ancillary Applications.Our core processing software applications are designed to run banking processes for our financial institution clients, including deposit and lending systems, customer management, and other central management systems. Our diverse selection of market-focused core systems enables FIS to effectively compete in a wide range of markets. We also offer a number of services that are ancillary to the primary applications listed above, including branch automation, back office support systems and compliance support. In addition, our wealth management services address the specific needs of the affluent markets as well as commercial clients.  We also offer an application suite that assists automotive finance institutions in evaluating loan applications and credit risk and  managing their loan and lease portfolios.

•Internet and eBanking Channel Solutions.Our comprehensive suite of retail delivery applications enables financial institutions to integrate and streamline customer-facing operations and back-office processes, thereby improving customer interaction across all channels (e.g., branch offices, Internet, ATM, call centers). The FIS focus on consumer access has driven significant market innovation in this area, with multi-channel and multi-host solutions and a strategy that provides tight integration of services and a seamless customer experience.  Our Consumer Electronic Banking and Business Internet Banking both provide an extensive set of cash management capabilities, enabling customers to manage banking and payments through the Internet, mobile devices, accounting software and telephone. Corporate Electronic Banking solutions provide commercial treasury capabilities including cash management services and multi-bank collection and disbursement services that address the specialized needs of corporate customers. FIS systems provide full accounting and reconciliation for such transactions, serving as the system of record.

•Fraud, Risk Management and Compliance Solutions.Our decision solutions offer a full spectrum of options that cover the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account applicants to managing mature customer accounts and fraud. Our applications include know-your-customer, new account decisioning, new account opening, account and transaction management, fraud management and collections. Our risk management services utilize our proprietary risk management models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new account or accepting a check at either the point-of-sale, a physical branch location, or through the Internet. Our systems utilize a combination of advanced authentication procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit transactions for financial institutions.

•Syndicated Lending.Our syndicated loan applications are designed to support wholesale and commercial banking requirements necessary for all aspects of syndicated commercial loan origination, trade and servicing.

•Global Commercial Services.Our global commercial services include solutions, both onshore and offshore, designed to meet the technology challenges facing principally U.S. based clients, large or small, including financial institutions and non-financial institutions. Our technology solutions range in scope from consulting engagements to application development projects and from operations support for a single application to full management of information technology infrastructures. We also provide outsourcing teams to manage costs, improve operational efficiency, transform processes and deliver world-class customer service. There is an increased trend toward outsourcing in our customer base, thus expansion of these services represents one of FIS’ growth drivers.



•Strategic Consulting Services.We acquired The Capital Markets Company NV ("Capco") in December 2010.  Capco provides integrated consulting, technology and complex, large-scale transformation services.  Capco specializes in banking, capital markets, wealth and investment management, finance, risk and compliance, and technology.  Capco's North American operations are included in FSG.

ISG represented approximately20%of total2012revenues, with potential for both growth in existing customer accounts and new account penetration. Management believes the greatest potential for growth is in the Western European, Latin American and Asian markets.



Corporate and Other Segment



The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate overhead costs that are not allocated to operating segments. These include costs related to human resources, legal, risk, information security, finance and accounting and domestic sales and marketing, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates operating segment performance.



Sales and Marketing



We have an integrated team of experienced sales personnel with expertise in particular services and the needs of particular types of customers, e.g., financial institutions, other nonbanking customers, and international institutions. This organizational structure enables us to effectively bring relevant skills and knowledge to potential customers and to identify additional solutions for our existing customers, leveraging opportunities to cross-sell and up-sell. We target the majority of our potential customers via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound lead generation and telesales efforts.



Our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the various business units’ strategic plans in support of their revenue and profitability goals. Key components include thought leadership, consistent message development, internal and external communications, client conference content management, Web content creation and management, trade shows, demand generation campaign involvement and collateral development and management.



Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property



The Company owns intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights and patents, that is important to its future success.  We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents and applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide. We rely on trademark law to protect our rights in those brands. While we intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights, these legal protections and arrangements afford only limited protection, and there is no assurance that our competitors will not independently develop or license products, services, or capabilities that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours. In general, we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business, although we do license certain items from third parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms.



Competition













Research and Development



Our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems in response to the needs of our customers, and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.



As part of our research and development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints. Additionally, third-party software may be used for commodity-type functions within a technology platform environment. In the case of nearly all of our third-party software, enterprise license agreements exist for the third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply. As a result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party technology components. We work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services. In the years endedDecember 31, 2012,2011and2010, approximately 2% to 3% of revenues were invested in research and development efforts (excluding amounts capitalized).



Government Regulation



Our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, and foreign regulation, including federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices), privacy laws, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The compliance of our services with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors, including the manner in which our clients use them. Our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can assist them in their compliance efforts. The failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them, as well as the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties. The principal areas of regulation impacting our business are:



•Privacy.Our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves.

•Money Transfer.Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. These businesses are also subject to various state, local and tribal licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction's banking department.



•Consumer Reporting and Protection.Our retail check authorization services (Certegy Check Services) and account opening services (ChexSystems) maintain databases of consumer information and, as a consequence, are subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws. Among other things, the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their files, to dispute their accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed information.  The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over









the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers’ personal information, and compliance with these laws, we strive to maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling disputes.

The Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008 requires, among other provisions, information reporting obligations on payment settlement entities for calendar years beginning after December 31, 2010.  This law requires every merchant acquiring entity and third-party settlement organization to file information returns for the gross amount of reportable payment transactions for the calendar year and the reportable payment transactions for each month of the calendar year.  The reportable payment transactions are any transactions in which a payment card is accepted as payment and any third-party payment network.  This law resulted in significant additional Form 1099 reporting requirements for FIS.

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted and signed into law on July 21, 2010.   Among other provisions, this legislation created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "Bureau"), whose sole focus is to develop, implement and, with respect to financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the Bureau, including enhanced oversight of non-financial institutions providing financial services.  For financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institution's primary federal regulator.

The Dodd-Frank Act also amended the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (''EFTA'') by adding a new section 920 regarding limitations on certain interchange transaction fees and modification of certain payment card network rules. This provision requires that the Federal Reserve Board enact regulations governing interchange fees and network fees arising from electronic debit card and reloadable general-use gift card transactions.  Specifically, the amount of interchange fees that apply to such transactions on cards issued by financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets must be “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by a financial institution in connection with such transactions.  Pursuant to this provision, the Federal Reserve Board's final regulations (announced on June 29, 2011 and effective on October 1, 2011) establish a maximum permissible interchange fee that a covered issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction, in the amount of $0.21 per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, plus a possible $0.01 fraud prevention adjustment.  Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from these debit card interchange fee restrictions.



The maximum interchange fee established by the Federal Reserve Board for covered transactions is a significant reduction from the pre-October 1, 2011 per transaction average rate. For FIS, interchange fees are primarily pass-through fees to non-regulated issuers and this change did not have a direct impact on our earnings.  However, it is uncertain what the indirect financial impact will be on FIS, as our clients are faced with significant revenue reductions from the interchange rate changes.  Moreover, since not all regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, we are uncertain as to what extent the legislation may affect our business in the future.  The remaining proposed regulations do not appear to be intended to directly affect interchange fees applicable to credit card transactions, but they do prohibit networks from  “inhibiting” retailers from setting minimum purchase amounts for use of credit cards, as long as the minimum purchase amount is not greater than $10, so long as the value does not differentiate between card issuers or payment card networks.



The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits payment card issuers and payment networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks.  The effective date for this network exclusivity prohibition was April 1, 2012 with respect to issuers and October 1, 2011 with respect to networks.  Issuers of certain health-related and other benefit cards and general-use prepaid cards have a delayed effective date of April 1, 2013, or later in certain circumstances.



Issuers and networks are also prohibited from inhibiting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of the electronic debit transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them.  The merchant routing provisions became effective on October 1, 2011.



•Debt Collection.Our collection services are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.



•Oversight by Banking  Regulators.As a provider of electronic data processing and back-office services to financial institutions, FIS is subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC"), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller









of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities as part of the Multi-Region Data Processing Servicer Program ("MDPS").  The MDPS program includes technology providers that provide mission critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC Interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions and to ensure the services we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions we process. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our customers’ auditors and regulators. We are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information.



The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our Company is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously.  Enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.

Information Security



Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication.  Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public, sensitive information.  FIS is not immune to such attacks.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including but not limited to sensitive information of our customers and personal consumer data.  We also operate payment, cash access and prepaid card systems.  For more information on Information Security, see Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2012, we had more than 35,000 employees, including approximately 21,000 employees principally employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is unionized. Approximately 11,100 of our employees, primarily in Brazil and Germany, are represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with employees to be good.
