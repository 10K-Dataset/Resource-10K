Competitive Strengths

We believe our competitive strengths include the following:



•Brand- FIS has built a global brand known for innovation and thought leadership in the financial services sector.



•Global Distribution and Scale -Our worldwide presence, array of solution offerings, customer breadth, established infrastructure and employee depth enable us to leverage our client relationships and global scale to drive revenue growth and operating efficiency.  We are a global leader in many of the markets we serve, supported by a large, knowledgeable talent pool of employees around the world.











•Extensive Domain Expertise and Extended Portfolio Depth- FIS has a significant number and wide range of high-quality software applications and service offerings that have been developed over many years with substantial input from our customers.  Our broad portfolio of solutions includes a wide range of flexible service arrangements for the deployment and support of our software, from managed processing arrangements, either at the customer's site or at an FIS location, including data centers or our private cloud, to traditional license and maintenance fee approaches.  This broad solution set allows us to bundle tailored or integrated services to compete effectively.  In addition, FIS is able to use the modular nature of our software applications and our ability to integrate many of our services with the services of others to provide customized solutions that respond to individualized customer needs.  We understand the needs of our customers and have developed and acquired innovative solutions that we believe can give them a competitive advantage and reduce their operating costs.We have made significant investment in modernizing our platforms and solutions and in moving our server compute into our private cloud located in our strategic data centers to increase our competitiveness in the global marketplace.



•Excellent and Long-Term Relationships with Customers- A significant percentage of FIS' business with our customers relates to applications and services provided under multi-year, recurring contracts.  The nature of these relationships allows us to develop close partnerships with these customers, resulting in high client retention rates.  As the breadth of FIS' service offerings has expanded, we have found that our access to key customer personnel is increasing, presenting greater opportunities for cross-selling and providing integrated, total solutions to our customers.



Strategy



Our mission is to deliver superior solutions and services to our clients and to expand our client base, which will result in sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders.  Our strategy to achieve this goal has been and continues to be built on the following pillars:



•Build, Buy, or Partner to Add Solutions to Cross-Sell Existing Clients and Win New Clients- We continue to invest in growth through internal software development as well as through acquisitions and equity investments that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities, providing us with additional solutions to cross-sell existing clients and capture the interest of new clients.  We also partner from time to time with other entities to provide comprehensive offerings to our prospects and customers.  By investing in solution innovation and integration, we continue to expand our value proposition to our prospects and clients.  Through our acquisition of Worldpay, we are a global leader in merchant acquiring and global eCommerce solutions.



•Support Our Clients Through Innovation- Changing market dynamics, particularly in the areas of information security, regulation and innovation, are transforming the way our clients operate, which is driving incremental demand for our integrated solutions and services around our intellectual property.  As prospects and customers evaluate technology, business process changes and vendor risks, our depth of services capabilities enables us to become involved earlier in their planning and design process and assist them as they manage through these changes.



•Continually Improve to Drive Margin Expansion- We strive to optimize our performance through investments in infrastructure enhancements, our workforce and other measures that are designed to drive margin expansion.



•Expand Client Relationships- The overall marketwe servecontinues to gravitate beyond single-application purchases to multi-solution partnerships.  As the market dynamics shift, we expect our clients and prospects to rely more on our multidimensional service offerings.  Our leveraged solutions and processing expertise can produce meaningful value and cost savings for our clients through more efficient operating processes, improved service quality and convenience for our clients' customers.



•Build Global Diversification- We continue to deploy resources in strategic global markets where we expect to achieve meaningful scale.

Merchant Solutions ("Merchant")



The Merchant segment is focused on serving merchants of all sizes globally, enabling them to accept electronic payments, including credit, debit and prepaid payments originated at a physical point of sale as well as in card-not-present environments such as eCommerce and mobile.  Merchant services include all aspects of payment processing, including authorization and settlement, customer service, chargeback and retrieval processing, reporting for electronic payment transactions and network fee and interchange management.  Merchant also includes value-added services, such as security and fraud prevention solutions, advanced data analytics and information management solutions, foreign currency management and numerous funding options.  Merchant serves clients in over 140 countries.  Our Merchant clients are highly-diversified, including non-discretionary everyday spend categories, such as grocery and pharmacy, and include15of the U.S. top25national retailers in2019ranked by sales, as well as global enterprises and small- to medium-sized businesses.  The Merchant segment utilizes broad and varied distribution channels, including direct sales forces and multiple referral partner relationships that provide us with a growing and diverse client base.



Our solutions in this segment include the following:



•Merchant Acquiring Solutions.Our merchant acquiring solutions primarily provide traditional point-of-sale payment processing for merchants of all sizes with a focus on large multi-national enterprises. Our solutions provide payment acceptance from various payment types, including but not limited to debit, credit, EMV, contactless and loyalty point redemption.  We also provide various value-added services for merchants including fraud, settlement, chargeback and onboarding services.



•Integrated Payment Solutions.Our integrated payment solutions primarily leverage an independent software vendor ("ISV") partnership model where FIS provides the merchant acquiring capabilities for the ISV partner across several industry verticals and sub-verticals.  This partnership model allows FIS to avoid conflict of interest amongst the ISV providers and also reduces risk of maintaining and updating the software itself.  These solutions also include merchant acquiring for payment facilitators ("PayFacs"), which consolidates multiple sub-merchant accounts under a master merchant identification number ("MID") account.  Across all clients our integrated payment solutions also provide value-added services.



•Global eCommerce Solutions.Our global eCommerce solutions provide card-not-present merchant acquiring capabilities to merchants of all sizes looking to sell their goods and services digitally.  Our platforms enable both domestic and international capabilities and can provide a customizable and scalable solution to our merchants.  We believe our solutions are differentiated by the authorization rates we provide to our clients in addition to our global scale.



Banking Solutions ("Banking")



The Banking segment is focused on serving all sizes of financial institutions for core processing and ancillary applications solutions; digital solutions; fraud, risk management and compliance solutions; electronic funds transfer and network services solutions; payment solutions; wealth and retirement solutions; item processing and output services solutions; and services capitalizing on the continuing trend to outsource these solutions.  Clients in this segment include global financial institutions, U.S. regional and community banks, credit unions and commercial lenders, as well as government institutions, and other commercial organizations.  Banking serves clients in more than130countries.  Our applications include core processing software, which clients use to maintain the primary records of their customer accounts, and complementary applications and









services that interact directly with the core processing applications.  We provide our clients integrated solutions characterized by multi-year processing contracts that generate highly recurring revenue.  The predictable nature of cash flows generated from the Banking segment provides opportunities for further investments in innovation, integration, information and security, and compliance in a cost-effective manner.  The results in this segment included the Reliance Trust Company of Delaware business through its divestiture on December 31, 2018; the Company's Brazilian Venture business through its divestiture as part of the joint venture unwinding transaction on December 31, 2018; and the Capco risk and compliance consulting business through its divestiture on July 31, 2017 (see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).



Our solutions in this segment include the following:



•Core Processing and Ancillary Applications Solutions.Our core processing software applications are designed to run banking processes for our financial institution clients, including deposit and lending systems, customer management, and other central management systems, serving as the system of record for processed activity.  Our diverse selection of market-focused core systems enables FIS to compete effectively in a wide range of markets.  We continue to invest in our core modernization efforts to further differentiate our offerings for the long term.  We also offer a number of services that are ancillary to the primary applications listed above, including branch automation, back-office support systems and compliance support.





•

Digital Solutions, including Internet, Mobile and eBanking.

Our comprehensive suite of retail delivery applications enables financial institutions to integrate and streamline customer-facing operations and back-office processes, thereby improving customer interaction across all channels (e.g., branch offices, internet, ATM, mobile, and call centers).  FIS' focus on consumer access has driven significant market innovation in this area, with multi-channel and multi-host solutions and a strategy that provides tight integration of services and a seamless customer experience.

We have been providing our large regional banking customers in the U.S. with Digital One, an integrated digital banking platform, and are now adding functionality and offering Digital One to our community bank clients to provide a consistent, omnichannel experience for consumers of banking services across self-service channels like mobile banking and online banking, as well as supporting channels for bank staff operating in bank branches and contact centers.

The uniform customer experience will extend to support a broad range of financial services including opening new accounts; servicing of existing accounts; providing money movement services; and personal financial management; as well as a broad range of other consumer, small business and commercial banking capabilities.  Digital One is integrated into several of the core banking platforms offered by FIS and is also offered to customers of non-FIS core banking systems.



•Fraud, Risk Management and Compliance Solutions.Our decision solutions offer a spectrum of options that cover the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account applicants to managing existing customer accounts and fraud.  Our applications include know-your-customer, new account decisioning and opening, account and transaction management, fraud management and collections.  Our risk management services use our proprietary risk management models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new account.  Our systems use a combination of advanced authentication procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit transactions for financial institutions.



•Electronic Funds Transfer and Network Services Solutions.Our electronic funds transfer and debit card processing businesses offer settlement and card management solutions for financial institution card issuers.  We provide traditional ATM-based debit network access through NYCE, other branded networks, and emerging real-time payment alternatives.  Our networks connect millions of cards and point-of-sale locations nationwide, providing consumers with secure, real-time access to their money.  Also through our networks, clients such as financial institutions, retailers and independent ATM operators can capitalize on the efficiency, consumer convenience and security of electronic real-time payments, real-time account-to-account transfers, and strategic alliances such as surcharge-free ATM network arrangements.



•Card and Retail Payment Solutions.Our card and retail payment technology and services allow financial institutions to issue VISA®, MasterCard®or American Express®branded credit and debit cards or other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts.  Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point-of-sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card-related services.  We offer Europay, MasterCard and VISA ("EMV") integrated circuit cards, often referred to as smart cards or chip cards, as well as a variety of stored-value card types and loyalty/reward programs.  Our integrated services range from card production and activation to processing to an extensive range of fraud management services and value-added loyalty programs designed to increase card usage and fee-based revenue for financial institutions and merchants.  The majority of our programs are full









service, including most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to operate a credit card program.  We do not make credit decisions for our card issuing clients.  We are also a leading provider of prepaid card services, which include gift cards and reloadable cards, with end-to-end solutions for development, processing and administration of stored-value programs.  Our closed-loop gift card solutions and loyalty programs provide merchants compelling solutions to drive consumer loyalty.



•Wealth and Retirement Solutions.We provide wealth and retirement solutions that help banks, trust companies, brokerage firms, insurance firms, retirement plan professionals, benefit administrators and independent advisors acquire, service and grow their client relationships.  We provide solutions for client acquisition, transaction management, trust accounting and recordkeeping that can be deployed stand-alone or as part of an integrated wealth or retirement platform, or on an outsourced basis.



•Item Processing and Output Services Solutions.Our item processing services furnish financial institutions with the technology needed to capture data from checks, transaction tickets and other items; image and sort items; process exceptions through keying; and perform balancing, archiving and the production of statements.  Our item processing services are performed at one of our multiple item processing centers located throughout the U.S. or on-site at client locations.  Our extensive solutions include distributed (i.e., non-centralized) data capture, mobile deposit capture, check and remittance processing, fraud detection, and document and report management.  Clients encompass banks and corporations of all sizes, from de novo banks to the largest financial institutions and corporations.  We offer a number of output services that are ancillary to the primary solutions we provide, including print and mail capabilities, document composition software and solutions, and card personalization fulfillment services.  Our print and mail services offer complete computer output solutions for the creation, management and delivery of print and fulfillment needs.  We provide our card personalization fulfillment services for branded credit cards and branded and non-branded debit and prepaid cards.



Capital Market Solutions ("Capital Markets")



The Capital Markets segment is focused on serving global financial services clients with a broad array of buy- and sell-side solutions.  Clients in this segment operate in more than100countries and include asset managers, buy-and sell-side securities, brokerage and trading firms, insurers, private equity firms, and other commercial organizations.  Our buy- and sell-side solutions include a variety of mission-critical applications for record keeping, data and analytics, trading, financing and risk management.  Capital Markets clients purchase our solutions and services in various ways including licensing and managing technology "in-house," using consulting and third-party service providers, as well as fully outsourcing end-to-end solutions.  We have long-established relationships with many of these financial and commercial institutions that generate significant recurring revenue.  We have made, and continue to make, investments in modern platforms; advanced technologies, such as cloud delivery, open APIs, machine learning and artificial intelligence; and regulatory technology to support our Capital Markets clients.



Our solutions in this segment include the following:



•Securities Processing and Finance Solutions.Our offerings help financial institutions to increase the efficiency, transparency and control of their back-office trading operations, post-trade processing and settlement including derivative solutions, risk management, securities lending, syndicated lending, tax processing, and regulatory compliance.  The breadth of our offerings also facilitates advanced business intelligence and market data distribution based on our extensive market data access.



•Global Trading Solutions.  Our trading solutions provide trade execution, data and network solutions to financial institutions, corporations and municipalities in North America, Europe and other global markets across a variety of asset classes. Our trade execution and network solutions help both buy- and sell-side firms improve execution quality, decrease overall execution costs and address today's trade connectivity challenges.



•Asset Management and Insurance Solutions.  We offer solutions that help institutional investors, insurance companies, hedge funds, private equity firms, fund administrators and securities transfer agents improve both investment decision-making and operational efficiency, while managing risk and increasing transparency.  Our asset management solutions support every stage of the investment process, from research and portfolio management, to valuation, risk management, compliance, investment accounting, transfer agency and client reporting.  Our insurance solutions help support front-office and back-office functions including actuarial risk calculations, policy administration and financial









and investment accounting and reporting for a variety of insurance lines, including life and health, annuities and pensions, property and casualty, reinsurance, and asset management.



•Corporate Liquidity Solutions.Our corporate liquidity solutions help chief financial officers and treasurers manage working capital by reducing risk and improving communication and response time between a company's buyers, suppliers, banks and other stakeholders.  Our end-to-end collaborative financial management framework helps bring together receivables, treasury and payments for a single view of cash and risk, which helps our clients optimize business processes for enhanced liquidity management.



Corporate and Other Segment



The Corporate and Other segment consists of corporate overhead expense, certain leveraged functions and miscellaneous expenses that are not included in the operating segments, as well as certain non-strategic businesses.  The overhead and leveraged costs relate to corporate marketing, corporate finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs, such as acquisition and integration expenses, that are not considered when management evaluates revenue-generating segment performance.  The Corporate and Other segment also includes the impact on revenue for 2018 and 2017 of adjusting deferred revenue to fair value from the acquisition of SunGard and its subsidiaries on November 30, 2015 (the "SunGard acquisition").



The non-strategic business solutions in this segment have been divested as follows:



•Retail Check Processing.Effective August 31, 2018, FIS sold substantially all the assets of the Certegy Check Services business unit in North America (see Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).



•Public Sector and Education.We completed the sale of our Public Sector and Education business on February 1, 2017 (see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).



Sales and Marketing



We have experienced sales personnel with expertise in particular services and markets, as well as across our various customer segments.  We believe that focusing our expertise in specific markets (e.g., global financial institutions, North American financial institutions, North American merchants, etc.) and tailoring integrated solution sets of particular value to participants in those markets enables us to leverage opportunities to cross-sell and up-sell.  We continue to realign our sales teams to better match our solution expertise with the market opportunity and customer demand.  We target the majority of our potential customers via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound lead generation and telesales efforts.



Our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the Merchant, Banking and Capital Markets strategic marketing plans in support of their revenue and profitability goals and the FIS brand.  Key components include thought leadership, integrated go-to-market programs, internal communications and readiness, media relations, client events, trade shows, high-touch client programs, demand generation campaigns and collateral development and management across digital and online channels.



Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property



In general, we own the intellectual property and proprietary rights that are necessary for the conduct of our business and important to our future success, including trademarks, trade names, trade secrets, copyrights and patents.  We license certain items from third parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms, including some "open source" licenses.  Although we acquired the trademarks and trade names used by SunGard, we note that following the split-off of the Availability Services ("AS") business by SunGard in 2014, AS has the right to use the Sungard Availability Services name, which does not include the right to use the SunGard name or its derivatives.



We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, trade secrets, copyrights and applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide.  We rely on trademark law to protect our rights in our brands.  We intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including by legal action when necessary and appropriate.











Competition





Research and Development



Our research and development activities primarily relate to the modernization of our proprietary core systems and the design and development of next generation digital solutions, processing systems, software applications and risk management platforms.  We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our clients and to enhance the capabilities of our outsourcing infrastructure.  In addition, we intend to offer services compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.



As part of our research and development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms.  To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in the evaluation of various infrastructure components.  Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings.  In the case of nearly all of our third-party software, enterprise license agreements exist for the third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply.  As a result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party technology components.  Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints.  Additionally, third-party software may be used for commodity-type functions within a technology platform environment.  We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services.  During the years endedDecember 31, 2019,2018and2017we incurred research and development costs that were non-capitalizable of approximately 3% to 4% of revenue.



Government Regulation











regulations may result in suspension or revocation of the permission-based regulatory licenses and/or restrictions on our ability to provide those services and/or the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties, and/or reputational damage.  Further, regulatory authorities have the power to, among other things, enjoin "unsafe or unsound" practices, require affirmative actions to correct any violation or practice, issue administrative orders that can be judicially enforced and direct the sale of subsidiaries or other assets.  We may be adversely affected by increased regulatory scrutiny or related negative publicity.



The principal areas of regulation impacting our business are the following:





•

Oversight by Banking Regulators.



Our U.S.-based wealth and retirement business holds a charter in the state of Georgia which makes us subject to the regulatory compliance requirements of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance.  As a result, we are also authorized to provide trust services in various additional states subject to additional applicable state regulations.





•

Oversight by Securities Regulators.



Our subsidiaries also include an SEC-registered transfer agent.  Our registered transfer agent is subject to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.  These laws and regulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address non-compliance with regulatory requirements.  Sanctions that may be imposed for non-compliance with these requirements include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures and significant fines.



Subsidiaries engaged in activities outside the U.S. are regulated by various government agencies in the particular jurisdiction where they are chartered, incorporated and/or conduct their business activity.  For example, pursuant to the U.K. Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA"), certain of our subsidiaries are subject to regulations promulgated and administered by the FCA.  The FSMA and rules promulgated thereunder govern all aspects of the









U.K. investment business, including sales, research and trading practices, provision of investment advice, use and safekeeping of client funds and securities, regulatory capital, recordkeeping, margin practices and procedures, approval standards for individuals, anti-money laundering, periodic reporting and settlement procedures.





•

Payment Services Oversight.



•Privacy and Data Protection.The Company is subject to an increasing number of privacy and data protection laws, regulations and directives globally (referred to collectively as "Privacy Laws"), many of which place restrictions on the Company’s ability to efficiently transfer, access and use personal data across its business.  The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve.



Our financial institution clients operating in the U.S. are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (referred to as "GLBA") and numerous similar state laws.  GLBA and those state laws place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information.  All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations under GLBA, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions.  As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy laws and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as apply to the financial institutions themselves.  A determination that there have been violations of privacy laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our business and reputation.



In July 2016, the European Commission formally approved and adopted the EU-US Privacy Shield, providing a compliance framework for organizations to transfer personal data regarding citizens of the E.U. to the U.S.  While we have certified certain lines of business under the Privacy Shield, we have chosen to adopt E.U. model clauses published by the European Commission as the primary basis for the export of data from the E.U. to the U.S.



The E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR"), which became effective on May 25, 2018, applies to all organizations processing the personal data of individuals in the E.U., regardless of where such organization is based. The GDPR has heightened our data protection compliance obligations, impacted our businesses’ collection, processing  and retention of personal data and imposed stricter standards for reporting data breaches.  The GDPR also imposes significant penalties for non-compliance.



The Company is also subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), which came into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides California residents additional data protection rights including the right to be informed about the personal information collected by third parties and the use of that personal information.  Further, certain operations of the Company will be subject to the Brazilian General Personal Data Protection Act, which is scheduled to become effective in August 2020.  TheCompany has adopted a comprehensive global privacy program to assess and manage these evolving risks.



In addition, our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to surveillance, encryption and data onshoring in the jurisdictions in which we operate.  Compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our technology for information security, operational infrastructure, policies and procedures, which could be time-consuming and costly.











•Money Transfer.Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations.  These businesses may also be subject to certain state and local licensing requirements.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing.  In applicable states, we have obtained money transmitter licenses.  However, changes to state money transmission laws and regulations, including changing interpretations and the implementation of new or varying regulatory requirements, may result in the need for additional or expanded money transmitter licenses, additional capital allocations or changes in the way in which we deliver certain services.



We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (referred to as "OFAC"), which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations.  Similar anti-money laundering laws apply to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with persons specified in lists maintained by the country equivalents to OFAC in several other countries.  We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by OFAC, as well as all other applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations.





•

Consumer Reporting and Protection.

Our decision solutions subsidiary, ChexSystems, maintains a database of consumer information used to provide various account ope

ning services including credit scoring analysis and is subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") and similar state laws.  The FCRA regulates consumer reporting agencies ("CRAs"), including ChexSystems, and governs the accuracy, fairness, and privacy of information in the files of CRAs that engage in the practice of assembling or evaluating certain information relating to consumers for certain specified purposes.  CRAs are required to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of information concerning the individual about whom the report relates and if a consumer disputes the accuracy of any information in the consumer’s file, to conduct a reasonable investigation within statutory timelines.  The FCRA imposes many other requirements on CRAs and users of consumer report information.  Regulatory enforcement of the FCRA is under the purview of the United States Federal Trade Commission

, the CFPB, and state attorneys general, acting alone or in concert with one another.  In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers' personal information, and compliance with these laws, we have made considerable investment to maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate accurate and timely handling of consumer requests for information and handling disputes.  We also are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect consumer's personal information in compliance with these laws.



Our consumer reporting and consumer-facing businesses are subject to CFPB Bulletin 2013-7 (a succesor to the former Regulation AA - Unfair Deceptive Acts or Practices), which defines Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts or Practices ("UDAAP").  This specific bulletin states that UDAAPs can cause significant financial injury to consumers, erode consumer confidence, and undermine fair competition in the financial marketplace.  Original creditors and other covered persons and service providers under the Dodd-Frank Act involved in collecting debt related to any consumer financial product or service are subject to the prohibition against UDAAPs in the Dodd-Frank Act.



•Debt Collection.Our collection services are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements.  The FTC, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.



•Anti-Corruption.FIS is subject to applicable anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, in the jurisdictions in which it operates.  Anti-corruption laws generally prohibit offering, promising, giving, or authorizing others to give anything of value, either directly or indirectly, to a government official or private party in order to influence official action or otherwise gain an unfair business advantage, such as to obtain or retain business.  FIS has implemented policies, procedures, training and internal controls that are designed to comply with such laws, rules and regulations.



The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our Company is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously.  Enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the









operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.



Information Security



Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication.  This is a trend we expect to continue.  Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public information.  These circumstances present both a threat and an opportunity for FIS.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including sensitive customer information and personal consumer data.  We also operate payment, cash access and prepaid card systems.



FIS remains focused on making strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems.  This includes both capital expenditures and operating expense on hardware, software, personnel and consulting services.  We also participate in industry and governmental initiatives to improve information security for our clients.  Through the expertise we have gained with this ongoing focus and involvement, we have developed fraud, security, risk management and compliance solutions to target this growth opportunity in the financial services industry.



For more information on Information Security, see "Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."



Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2019, we had more than 55,000 employees, including approximately 36,000 employees principally employed outside of the U.S.  None of our U.S. workforce currently is unionized.  Approximately 9,000 of our employees, primarily in Brazil, U.K., Tunisia, Germany, France, Italy, Mexico and Chile, are represented by labor unions or works councils.  We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
