With a long history deeply rooted in the financial services industry and banking and payment technology solutions, FIS delivers services to more than 14,000 institutions in over 100 countries. Headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, FIS employs more than 38,000 employees worldwide and holds leadership positions in payment processing solutions and integrated banking solutions, providing outsourced solutions, software and services for technologies and processes that drive a financial institution’s operations. Through our Capco brand, we deliver globally a wide range of information technology consulting and transformational services to financial institutions.  FIS has topped the annual FinTech 100 list, a ranking of financial services industry technology providers, for the last three years and is a member of the Fortune 500 U.S. and of Standard and Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index.



FIS is incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia as Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. and our stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol "FIS".



We have grown organically as well as through acquisitions, which have contributed critical applications and services that complement or enhance our existing offerings, diversifying our revenues by customer, geography and service offering.  These acquired offerings include integrated consulting services, integrated core banking and payment solutions, mobile banking solutions, item processing services, card issuer services, risk management solutions, electronic loan amendment applications and services, electronic funds transfer ("EFT") services, and prepaid/gift card processing for community banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions. Many of these solutions are also sold to domestic companies, global organizations and companies domiciled outside of North America. These strategic acquisitions enabled us to broaden our available solution sets, scale our operations, develop our global consulting expertise, expand our customer base and strengthen our competitive position.



Financial Information About Operating Segments and Geographic Areas



We report the results of our operations in four reporting segments: 1) Financial Solutions Group (“FSG”); 2) Payment Solutions Group (“PSG”); 3) International Solutions Group (“ISG”); and 4) Corporate and Other.



Competitive Strengths



We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:



•Brand— FIS has built a global brand known for innovation and thought leadership in the financial services sector.  Capco likewise has a strong brand in integrated consulting and technology services in this sector.

•Global Reach, Distribution and Scale —Our worldwide presence, array of solution offerings, customer breadth, established infrastructure and employee depth enable us to leverage our client relationships and global scale to drive revenue growth and operating efficiency.   We are a leader in the markets we serve, supported by a large, knowledgeable talent pool of employees around the world.

•Extensive Domain Expertise and Portfolio Depth— FIS has a significant number and wide range of high-quality software applications and service offerings that have been developed over many years with substantial input from our customers.  We use our industry and technology experience to tailor these applications and service offerings to provide our customers comprehensive business solutions.  These solutions include a wide range of flexible service arrangements for the deployment and support of our software, from managed processing arrangements to traditional license and maintenance fee approaches, either at the customer’s site or at an FIS location.  This broad solution set allows us to bundle tailored or integrated services to compete effectively. In addition, FIS is able to use the modular nature of our software applications and our ability to integrate many of our services with the services of others to provide customized solutions that respond to individualized customer needs.  We understand the needs of our customers and have developed innovative solutions that can give them a competitive advantage and reduce their operating costs.









•Excellent Relationship with Customers— A significant percentage of FIS’ business with our customers relates to core processing applications and services provided under multi-year, recurring contracts, and the nature of this relationship allows us to develop close partnerships with these customers. As the breadth of FIS’ service offerings has expanded, we have found that our access to key customer personnel is increasing, presenting greater opportunities for cross-selling and providing integrated, total solutions to our customers.

Strategy



Our mission is to deliver superior solutions and services to our customers, which will result in sustained revenue and earnings growth for our shareholders. Our strategy to achieve this goal has been and continues to be built on the following pillars:



•Expand Client Relationships—  The overall marketwe servecontinues to gravitate beyond single-product purchases to multi-solution partnerships.  As the market dynamics shift, we expect our clients to rely more on our multidimensional service offerings.  Our leveraged solutions and processing expertise can produce meaningful value and cost savings for our clients through more efficient operating processes, improved service quality and convenience for our clients' customers.

•Buy, Build or Partner to Add Solutions to Cross-Sell— We continue to invest in growth through internal product development, as well as through product-focused or market-centric acquisitions and equity investments that complement and extend our existing solutions and capabilities, providing us with additional solutions to cross-sell.  We also partner from time to time with other entities to provide comprehensive offerings to our customers.  By investing in solution innovation and integration, we continue to expand our value proposition to clients.

•Support Our Clients Through Transformation— Changing market dynamics, particularly in the areas of information security, regulation and innovation, are transforming the way our clients operate, which is driving incremental demand for our leveraged solutions, consulting expertise, and services around intellectual property.  As customers evaluate technology and business process changes, our depth of services capabilities enables us to become involved earlier in their planning and design process and assist them as they manage through these changes.

•Continually Improve to Drive Margin Expansion— We strive to optimize our performance through investments in infrastructure enhancements, our workforce and other measures that are designed to create organic revenue and margin expansion.

•Build Global Diversification—  We continue to deploy resources in emerging global markets where we expect to achieve meaningful scale.

Financial Solutions Group



The focus of FSG is to provide comprehensive services and software to satisfy the technology, processing and outsourcing needs of our financial institution customers in North America. We service the core and related ancillary processing needs of North American banks, credit unions, automotive financial companies, commercial lenders, and independent community and savings institutions. FIS offers a broad selection of in-house and outsourced solutions to banking customers that span the range of asset sizes. FSG customers are typically committed under multi-year contracts that provide a stable, recurring revenue base and opportunities for cross-selling additional financial and payments offerings.



We employ several business models to provide our solutions to our customers. We typically deliver the highest value to our customers when we combine our software applications and deliver them in one of several types of outsourcing arrangements,









such as an application service provider, through facilities management processing or by an application management arrangement. We are also able to deliver individual applications through a software licensing arrangement. Based upon our expertise gained through the foregoing arrangements, some clients also retain us to manage their IT operations with or without using any of our proprietary software.  We also provide strategic consulting services that help financial institutions define and manage their technology strategies and projects.



Our solutions in this segment include:



•Core Processing and Ancillary Applications.Our core processing software applications are designed to run banking processes for our financial institution clients, including deposit and lending systems, customer management, and other central management systems, serving as the system of record for processed activity.  Our diverse selection of market-focused core systems enables FIS to compete effectively in a wide range of markets. We also offer a number of services that are ancillary to the primary applications listed above, including branch automation, back office support systems and compliance support. In addition, our wealth management services address the specific needs of the affluent markets as well as commercial clients.  We also offer an application suite that assists automotive finance institutions in evaluating loan applications and credit risk and managing their loan and lease portfolios.



•Internet, Mobile and eBanking Channel Solutions.Our comprehensive suite of retail delivery applications enables financial institutions to integrate and streamline customer-facing operations and back-office processes, thereby improving customer interaction across all channels (e.g., branch offices, Internet, ATM, Mobile, call centers). FIS' focus on consumer access has driven significant market innovation in this area, with multi-channel and multi-host solutions and a strategy that provides tight integration of services and a seamless customer experience. FIS is a leader in mobile banking solutions and our Consumer Electronic Banking, Mobile Banking and Corporate Electronic Banking provide an extensive set of cash management capabilities, enabling customers to manage banking and payments through the Internet, mobile devices, accounting software and telephone. Corporate Electronic Banking solutions provide commercial treasury capabilities including cash management services and multi-bank collection and disbursement services that address the specialized needs of corporate customers. FIS systems provide full accounting and reconciliation for such transactions, serving here also as the system of record.



•Fraud, Risk Management and Compliance Solutions.Our decision solutions offer a spectrum of options that cover the account lifecycle from helping to identify qualified account applicants to managing mature customer accounts and fraud. Our applications include know-your-customer, new account decisioning and opening, account and transaction management, fraud management and collections. Our risk management services use our proprietary risk management models and data sources to assist in detecting fraud and assessing the risk of opening a new account or accepting a check at either the point-of-sale, a physical branch location, or through the Internet. Our systems use a combination of advanced authentication procedures, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence modeling and proprietary and shared databases to assess and detect fraud risk for deposit transactions for financial institutions.  We also provide outsourced risk management and compliance solutions that are configurable to a customer's regulatory and risk management requirements.



•Syndicated Lending.Our syndicated loan applications are designed to support wholesale and commercial banking requirements necessary for all aspects of syndicated commercial loan origination, amendment, trade and servicing.



•Global Commercial Services.As our customers address their financial, regulatory, growth and security challenges, there is an increased trend toward outsourcing. Our global commercial services include solutions, both onshore and offshore, designed to meet the technology challenges facing clients, large or small, including financial institutions and non-financial institutions. These solutions range in scope from consulting engagements to application development projects and from operations support for a single application to full management of information technology infrastructures. We also provide outsourcing teams to manage costs, improve operational efficiency and transform our customers' back office and customer service processes.   Expansion of these outsourcing services represents one of FIS’ growth opportunities.



•Strategic Consulting Services.Capco's North American operations are included in FSG.  Capco provides integrated consulting, technology and complex, large-scale IT transformation services to financial institutions.  Capco consultants work with financial institutions to design and implement improvements in their information technology architecture. Global financial institutions in particular can benefit from the combination of Capco's expertise and FIS' broad solution set as they transform in the aftermath of the financial crisis to restore customer confidence, reduce their cost structure and provide innovative solutions to their customers.











Payment Solutions Group



PSG provides a comprehensive set of services and software for the EFT, card processing, item processing, bill payment, and government payments processing needs of our customers in North America. PSG is focused on servicing the payment and EFT needs of North American headquartered banks and credit unions, commercial lenders, independent community and savings institutions and government institutions. PSG customers typically commit to multi-year contracts that provide recurring revenues based on underlying payment transaction volumes.  The common goal of our offerings continues to be convenience and security for the consumer, coupled with value to the financial institution and merchant.  In response to the expanding uses of mobile channels, we have delivered mobile payment solutions to our customers and continue to focus on this emerging market for our customers.



Our solutions in this segment include:



•Electronic Funds Transfer and Network Services.Our electronic funds transfer and debit card processing businesses offer settlement and card management solutions for financial institution card issuers. We provide traditional ATM- and PIN-based debit network access through NYCE, and emerging real-time payment alternatives are available through our PayNet®network. NYCE connects millions of cards and point-of-sale locations nationwide, providing consumers with secure, real-time access to their money. Also through NYCE and PayNet, clients such as financial institutions, retailers and independent ATM operators can capitalize on the efficiency, consumer convenience and security of electronic real-time payments, real-time account-to-account transfers, and strategic alliances such as surcharge-free ATM network arrangements. We are also a leading provider of prepaid card services, which include gift cards and reloadable cards, with end-to-end solutions for development, processing and administration of stored-value programs.



•Card Solutions.More than 4,400 financial institutions use a combination of our technology and/or services to issue VISA®, MasterCard®or American Express®branded credit and debit cards or other electronic payment cards for use by both consumer and business accounts. Card transactions continue to increase as a percentage of total point-of-sale payments, which fuels continuing demand for card-related services. We offer Europay, MasterCard and VISA ("EMV") integrated circuit cards, often referred to as smart cards or chip cards, as well as a variety of stored-value card types and loyalty/reward programs.  Our integrated services range from card production and activation to an extensive range of fraud management services to value-added loyalty programs designed to increase card usage and fee-based revenues. The majority of our programs are full service, including most of the operations and support necessary for an issuer to operate a credit card program. We do not make credit decisions for our card issuing customers.



•Item Processing and Output Services.Our item processing services furnish financial institutions with the equipment needed to capture data from checks, transaction tickets and other items; image and sort items; process exceptions through keying; and perform balancing, archiving and the production of statements. Our item processing services are used by more than 1,500 financial institutions and are performed at one of our eight item processing centers located throughout the U.S. or on-site at customer locations. Our extensive solutions include distributed (i.e., non-centralized) data capture, check and remittance processing, fraud detection, and document and report management. Customers encompass banks and corporations of all sizes, from de novo banks to the largest financial institutions and corporations. We offer a number of output services that are ancillary to the primary solutions we provide, including print and mail capabilities, document composition software and solutions,  and card personalization fulfillment services. Our print and mail services offer complete computer output solutions for the creation, management and delivery of print and fulfillment needs. We provide our card personalization fulfillment services for branded credit cards and branded and non-branded debit and prepaid cards.

FIS also provides Automated Clearing House ("ACH") processing.

Our check authorization system uses artificial intelligence modeling and other state-of-the-art technology to deliver accuracy, convenience and simplicity to retailers.  Our closed loop gift card solutions and loyalty programs provide merchants compelling solutions to drive consumer loyalty. In addition, our merchant card processing service provides a merchant or financial institution a comprehensive solution to manage its merchant card activities, including point-of-sale equipment, transaction authorization, draft capture, settlement, charge-back processing and reporting.



International Solutions Group



ISG provides local services to our customers in more than 100 countries around the world. The services delivered by FIS in these locations include many of the same financial and payments solutions we offer in North America. We provide core banking applications, channel solutions, card and merchant services, custodial services, item processing and check risk management solutions to financial institutions, card issuers and retailers.



Banking and Payments Services.Our international operations leverage existing applications and provide services for the specific business needs of our customers in targeted international markets. Services are delivered from 27 operations centers around the world. Our payment solutions services include fully outsourced card-issuer services and customer support, payment processing and switching services, prepaid and debit card processing, item processing, software licensing and maintenance, outsourced ATM management and retail point-of-sale check warranty services.

ISG represented approximately21%of total2013revenues, with potential for both growth in existing customer accounts and new account penetration.  Management believes the greatest potential for growth is in the Western European, Latin American and Asian markets.   Our Brazilian joint venture partner, Banco Bradesco, is our largest ISG customer and was responsible for23%of ISG revenue--See Related Party Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Corporate and Other Segment



The Corporate and Other segment consists of the corporate overhead costs that are not allocated to operating segments. These include costs related to human resources, legal, risk management, information security, internal audit, finance and accounting and domestic sales and marketing, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and other costs that are not considered when management evaluates operating segment performance.



Sales and Marketing



We see a trend in the buying behavior of financial services sector clients away from single products and toward integrated solutions that best suit a particular market of clients.  We have experienced sales personnel with expertise in particular services and markets as well as in the needs of particular types of customers. We believe that focusing our expertise in specific markets (e.g., global financial institutions, North American financial institutions) and tailoring integrated solution sets of particular value to participants in those markets will enable us to leverage opportunities to cross-sell and up-sell. As a result, we are realigning our sales teams to better match our solution expertise with the market opportunity and customer demand.  We are also planning to hire additional personnel with a specific focus on global financial institutions. We target the majority of our potential customers via direct and/or indirect field sales, as well as inbound and outbound lead generation and telesales efforts.



Our global marketing strategy is to develop and lead the execution of the FSG, PSG, and ISG strategic marketing plans in support of their revenue and profitability goals and the FIS brand. Key components include thought leadership, consistent message development, internal and external communications, client conference content management, Web content creation and management, trade shows, demand generation campaign involvement and collateral development and management.



Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property



The Company owns intellectual property, including trademarks, trade names, copyrights and patents, that is important to its future success.  We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices, patents, copyrights and









applicable law to establish and protect our software, technology and expertise worldwide. We rely on trademark law to protect our rights in those brands. We intend to continue taking appropriate measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including by legal action when necessary and appropriate. In general, we own the proprietary rights necessary for the conduct of our business, although we do license certain items from third parties under arms-length agreements for varying terms.



Competition





Research and Development



Our research and development activities have related primarily to the design and development of processing systems and related software applications and risk management platforms. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our proprietary systems and existing software applications, to develop new and innovative software applications and systems to address emerging technology trends in response to the needs of our customers and to enhance the capabilities surrounding our outsourcing infrastructure. In addition, we intend to offer services that are compatible with new and emerging delivery channels.



As part of our research and development process, we evaluate current and emerging technology for compatibility with our existing and future software platforms. To this end, we engage with various hardware and software vendors in evaluation of various infrastructure components. Where appropriate, we use third-party technology components in the development of our software applications and service offerings. In the case of nearly all of our third-party software, enterprise license agreements exist for the third-party component and either alternative suppliers exist or transfer rights exist to ensure the continuity of supply.  As a result, we are not materially dependent upon any third-party technology components. Third-party software may be used for highly specialized business functions, which we may not be able to develop internally within time and budget constraints.  Additionally, third-party software may be used for commodity-type functions within a technology platform environment. We work with our customers to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services. In each of the years endedDecember 31, 2013,2012and2011, approximately 2% to 3% of revenues were invested in research and development efforts.



Government Regulation



Our services are subject to a broad range of complex federal, state, and foreign regulation, including federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, Regulation AA (Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices), privacy laws, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act"). The compliance of our services and applications with these and other applicable laws and regulations depends on a variety of factors, including the manner in which our clients use them. Our clients are contractually responsible for determining what is required of them under applicable laws and regulations so that we can









assist them in their compliance efforts. The failure of our services to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide them, as well as the imposition of civil fines and/or criminal penalties. The principal areas of regulation impacting our business are:



•Privacy.Our financial institution clients are required to comply with privacy regulations imposed under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the privacy regulations and are bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our customers as apply to the financial institutions themselves.



•Money Transfer.Elements of our cash access and money transmission businesses are registered as a Money Services Business and are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. These businesses are also subject to various state, local and tribal licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission and the sale of stored value cards to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdiction's banking department.



•Consumer Reporting and Protection.Our retail check authorization services (Certegy Check Services) and account opening services (ChexSystems) maintain databases of consumer information and, as a consequence, are subject to the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act and similar state laws. Among other things, the Federal Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes requirements on us concerning data accuracy, and provides that consumers have the right to know the contents of their files, to dispute their accuracy, and to require verification or removal of disputed information.  The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws. In furtherance of our objectives of data accuracy, fair treatment of consumers, protection of consumers’ personal information, and compliance with these laws, we strive to, and have made considerable investment to, maintain a high level of security for our computer systems in which consumer data resides, and we maintain consumer relations call centers to facilitate efficient handling of consumer requests for information and handling disputes.   We also are focused on ensuring our operating environments safeguard and protect consumer's personal information in compliance with these laws.



The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted and signed into law on July 21, 2010.   Among other provisions, this legislation created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "Bureau"), whose sole focus is to develop, implement and, with respect to financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets, enforce consumer protection rules promulgated by the Bureau, including enhanced oversight of non-financial institutions providing financial services.  For financial institutions with less than $10 billion in assets, enforcement of the rules will be carried out by such institution's primary federal regulator.  Certain of our businesses that affect end consumers are subject to examination from time to time.



The Dodd-Frank Act and related Durbin Amendment also revised the Electronic Fund Transfer Act (''EFTA'') by adding a new section 920 regarding limitations on certain interchange transaction fees and modification of certain payment card network rules. This provision requires that the Federal Reserve Board enact regulations governing interchange fees and network fees arising from electronic debit card and reloadable general-use gift card transactions.  Specifically, the amount of interchange fees that apply to such transactions on cards issued by financial institutions with more than $10 billion in assets must be “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by a financial institution in connection with such transactions.  Pursuant to this provision, the Federal Reserve Board's final regulations (announced on June 29, 2011 and effective on October 1, 2011) established a maximum permissible interchange fee that a covered issuer may receive for an electronic debit transaction, in the amount of $0.21 per transaction and five basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction, plus a possible $0.01 fraud prevention adjustment.  Issuers that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion are exempt from these debit card interchange fee restrictions.



The maximum interchange fee established by the Federal Reserve Board for covered transactions is a significant reduction from the pre-October 1, 2011 per transaction average rate. For FIS, interchange fees are primarily pass-through fees to non-regulated issuers and this change did not have a direct impact on our earnings.  However, it is uncertain what the indirect financial impact will be on FIS, as certain of our clients are faced or may be faced with









significant fee income reductions from the interchange rate changes.  Moreover, since not all regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have been finalized, we are uncertain as to what extent any future legislation may affect our business in the future.  This legislated interchange fee cap and reduction of fee income for financial institutions also has the potential to alter the type and/or volume of card-based transactions that we process on behalf of our customers, but has had an insignificant impact thus far.  As we continue to monitor the market participants' actions, we believe we are competitively positioned to offset or take advantage of any potential shifts in payment transaction volume as we offer multiple payment solutions and options to our clients.



The Dodd-Frank Act and Durbin Amendment also prohibit payment card issuers and payment networks from restricting the number of networks over which electronic debit transactions may be processed to less than two unaffiliated networks.  The effective date for this network exclusivity prohibition was April 1, 2012 with respect to issuers and October 1, 2011 with respect to networks.  Issuers and networks are also prohibited from inhibiting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of the electronic debit transaction over any network that the issuer has enabled to process them.  The merchant routing provisions became effective on October 1, 2011.   These  provisions of the Durbin Amendment favorably impacted transaction volumes in our NYCE PIN debit network in 2013 and 2012; however, market participants' actions may positively or negatively impact transaction volumes in the future.  For issuers of general-use reloadable prepaid cards the network exclusivity prohibition provisions had an effective date of April 1, 2013 or later in certain circumstances.  The impact of these regulations on our general use prepaid business has been insignificant to date.



The Durbin Amendment regulations and interchange fee provisions released by the Federal Reserve have been challenged in court and we are monitoring how any final judicial decision will impact our customers and our business.



•Debt Collection.Our collection services are subject to the Federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and various state collection laws and licensing requirements. The Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general and other agencies, have enforcement responsibility over the collection laws, as well as the various credit reporting laws.





•

Oversight by Banking  Regulators.



The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which our Company is subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously.  Enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operations of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, and/or loss of revenue.



Information Security



Globally, attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication.  Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities.  The objectives of these attacks include, among other things, gaining unauthorized access to systems to facilitate financial fraud, disrupt operations, cause denial of service events, corrupt data, and steal non-public, sensitive information.  FIS is not immune to such attacks.  As part of our business, we electronically receive, process, store and transmit a wide range of confidential information, including but not limited to sensitive information of our customers and personal consumer data.  We also operate payment, cash access and









prepaid card systems.  For more information on Information Security, see Item 7Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2013, we had more than 38,000 employees, including approximately 23,000 employees principally employed outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. workforce currently is unionized. Approximately 11,000 of our employees primarily in Brazil and Germany are represented by labor unions. We consider our relations with employees to be good.
