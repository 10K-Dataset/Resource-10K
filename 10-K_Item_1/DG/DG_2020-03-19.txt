ITEM 1. BUSINESS

​

General

​

We are among the largest discount retailers in the United States by number of stores, with 16,368 stores located in 45 states as of February 28, 2020, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern United States. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumable items, seasonal items, home products and apparel. Our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands. We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices (typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations.

​

Our History

​

J.L. Turner founded our Company in 1939 as J.L. Turner and Son, Wholesale. We were incorporated as a Kentucky corporation under the name J.L. Turner & Son, Inc. in 1955, when we opened our first Dollar General store. We changed our name to Dollar General Corporation in 1968 and reincorporated in 1998 as a Tennessee corporation. Our common stock was publicly traded from 1968 until July 2007, when we merged with an entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., or KKR. In November 2009 our common stock again became publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “DG”, and in December 2013 the entity controlled by investment funds affiliated with KKR sold its remaining shares of our common stock.

​

Our Business Model

​

Our long history of profitable growth is founded on a commitment to a relatively simple business model: providing a broad base of customers with their basic everyday and household needs, supplemented with a variety of general merchandise items, at everyday low prices in conveniently located, small-box stores. We continually evaluate the needs and demands of our customers and modify our merchandise selections and pricing accordingly, while remaining focused on increasing profitability, cash generation and returns for our shareholders.

​

Our long-term operating priorities remain: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing growth opportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our people as a competitive advantage.  For more information on these operating priorities, see the “Executive Overview” section of Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in Part II, Item 7 of this report.

​

In 2019, we achieved our 30th consecutive year of positive same-store sales growth. We believe that this growth, which has taken place in a variety of economic conditions, is a result of our compelling value and convenience proposition, although no assurances can be given that we will continue to achieve positive same-store sales growth in any given year.

​

Compelling Value and Convenience Proposition.Our ability to deliver highly competitive prices in convenient locations and our easy “in and out” shopping format create a compelling shopping experience that we believe distinguishes us from other discount retailers as well as convenience, drug, grocery, online and mass merchant retailers. Our slogan “Save time. Save money. Every day!” summarizes our appeal to customers. We believe our ability to effectively deliver both value and convenience allows us to succeed in small markets with





limited shopping alternatives, as well as in larger and more competitive markets. Our value and convenience proposition is evidenced by the following attributes of our business model:

​

●Everyday Low Prices on Quality Merchandise.Our research indicates that we offer a price advantage over most food and drug retailers and that our prices are competitive with even the largest discount retailers. Our ability to offer everyday low prices on quality merchandise is supported by our low-cost operating structure and our strategy to maintain a limited number of items per merchandise category, which we believe helps us maintain strong purchasing power. We offer nationally advertised brands at these everyday low prices in addition to offering our own private brands at substantially lower prices.

​

●Convenient Locations.Our stores are conveniently located in a variety of rural, suburban and urban communities. We seek to locate our stores in close proximity to our customers, which helps drive customer loyalty and trip frequency and makes us an attractive alternative to large discount and other large-box retail and grocery stores.

​

●Time-Saving Shopping Experience.We strive to provide customers with a highly convenient, easy to navigate shopping experience. Our small-box stores make it easier to get in and out quickly. Our product offering includes most necessities, such as basic packaged and refrigerated or frozen food and dairy products, cleaning supplies, paper products, health and beauty care items, tobacco products, greeting cards and other stationery items, basic apparel, housewares, hardware and automotive supplies, among others. Our convenient hours and broad merchandise offering allow our customers to fulfill their requirements for basic goods and minimize their need to shop elsewhere.

​

Substantial Growth Opportunities.We believe we have substantial long-term growth potential in the U.S., and we have identified significant opportunities to add new stores in both existing and new markets. In addition, we have opportunities to relocate or remodel locations within our existing store base to better serve our customers. Our attractive store economics, including a relatively low initial investment and simple, low-cost operating model, have allowed us to grow our store base to current levels and provide us significant opportunities to continue our profitable store growth strategy.

​

Our Merchandise

​

We offer a focused assortment of everyday necessities, which we believe helps to drive frequent customer visits, and key items in a broad range of general merchandise categories. Our product assortment provides the opportunity for our customers to address most of their basic shopping needs with one trip. We offer a wide selection of nationally advertised brands from leading manufacturers. Additionally, our private brand products offer even greater value with options to purchase both products that are of comparable quality to national brands as well as opening price point items, each at substantial discounts to the national brands.

​

Consumables is our largest merchandise category and has continued to become a larger percentage of our total sales as indicated in the table below. Consumables include paper and cleaning products (such as paper towels, bath tissue, paper dinnerware, trash and storage bags, and laundry); packaged food (such as cereals, canned soups and vegetables, condiments, spices, sugar and flour); perishables (such as milk, eggs, bread, refrigerated and frozen food, beer and wine); snacks (such as candy, cookies, crackers, salty snacks and carbonated beverages); health and beauty (such as over-the-counter medicines and personal care products including soap, body wash, shampoo, cosmetics, dental hygiene and foot care products); pet (such as pet supplies and pet food); and tobacco products.

​

Seasonal products include holiday items, toys, batteries, small electronics, greeting cards, stationery, prepaid phones and accessories, gardening supplies, hardware, automotive and home office supplies.

​





Home products include kitchen supplies, cookware, small appliances, light bulbs, storage containers, frames, candles, craft supplies and kitchen, bed and bath soft goods.

​

Apparel includes casual everyday apparel for infants, toddlers, girls, boys, women and men, as well as socks, underwear, disposable diapers, shoes and accessories.

​

The percentage of net sales of each of our four categories of merchandise for the fiscal years indicated below was as follows:

​

​​​​​​​​​201920182017Consumables78.0%77.5%76.9%Seasonal11.7%11.9%12.1%Home products5.8%5.9%6.0%Apparel4.5%4.7%5.0%

​

Our seasonal and home products categories typically account for the highest gross profit margins, and the consumables category typically accounts for the lowest gross profit margin.

​

The Dollar General Store

​

The typical Dollar General store is operated by a store manager, one or more assistant store managers, and three or more sales associates. Our stores generally feature a low-cost, no frills building with limited maintenance capital, low operating costs, and a focused merchandise offering within a broad range of categories, allowing us to deliver low retail prices while generating strong cash flows and capital investment returns. Our stores average approximately 7,400 square feet of selling space, and approximately 75% of our stores are located in towns of 20,000 or fewer people. We generally have had good success in locating suitable store sites in the past, and we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in existing and new markets. In addition, we believe we have significant opportunities available for our relocation and remodel programs.

​

Our store growth over the past three years is summarized in the following table:

​

​​​​​​​​​​​​​Stores at​​Net​​​Beginning​Stores​Stores​Store​Stores atYear​of Year​Opened​Closed​Increase​End of Year201713,3201,3151011,21414,534​201814,5349006483615,370​201915,3709756790816,278​

​

Our Customers

​

Our customers seek value and convenience. Depending on their financial situation and geographic proximity, customers’ reliance on Dollar General varies from fill-in shopping, to making periodic trips to stock up on household items, to making weekly or more frequent trips to meet most essential needs. We generally locate our stores and plan our merchandise selections to best serve the needs of our core customers, the low and fixed income households often underserved by other retailers, and we are focused on helping them make the most of their spending dollars. At the same time, however, Dollar General shoppers from a wide range of income brackets and life stages appreciate our quality merchandise as well as our attractive value and convenience proposition.

​

Our Suppliers

​

We purchase merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers and maintain direct buying relationships with many producers of national brand merchandise. Despite our broad offering, we maintain only a limited number of items per category, allowing us to keep our average costs low. Our two largest suppliers each accounted for





approximately 8% of our purchases in 2019. Our private brands come from a wide variety of suppliers. We directly imported approximately 6% of our purchases at cost in 2019.

​

We consistently have been able to obtain sufficient quantities of core merchandise and believe that, if one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we generally would be able to obtain alternative sources; however, such alternative sources could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time and expenses, result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels, reduce our selection, or reduce the quality of our merchandise, and an inability to obtain alternative sources could adversely affect our sales.

​

Distribution and Transportation

​

Our stores are currently supported by distribution centers for non-refrigerated merchandise located strategically throughout our geographic footprint. We lease additional temporary warehouse space as necessary to support our distribution needs. In addition to our traditional distribution centers, we now operate multiple temperature-controlled distribution facilities in support of “DG Fresh”, our strategic, multi-phased shift to self-distribution of frozen and refrigerated goods, such as dairy, deli and frozen products. We regularly analyze and rebalance the network to ensure that it remains efficient and provides the service levels our stores require. See “—Properties” below for additional information pertaining to our distribution centers.

​

Most of our merchandise flows through our distribution centers and is delivered to our stores by third-party trucking firms, utilizing our trailers. We also own more than 300 semi-trailer trucks with which we transport our merchandise. In addition, vendors or third-party distributors deliver or ship certain food items and other merchandise directly to our stores.

​

Seasonality

​

Our business is somewhat seasonal. Generally, our most profitable sales mix occurs in the fourth quarter, which includes the Christmas selling season. In addition, our quarterly results can be affected by the timing of certain holidays, new store openings, remodels, relocations and store closings. We typically purchase substantial amounts of inventory and incur higher shipping and payroll costs in the third quarter in anticipation of increased sales activity during the fourth quarter. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.

​

Our Competition

​

We operate in the basic discount consumer goods market, which is highly competitive with respect to price, customers, store location, merchandise quality, assortment and presentation, service offerings, in-stock consistency, customer service, promotional activity, employees, and market share. We compete with discount stores and many other retailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety, online, and certain specialty stores. These other retail companies operate stores in many of the areas where we operate, and many of them engage in extensive advertising and marketing efforts. Our direct competitors include Family Dollar, Dollar Tree, Big Lots, 99 Cents Only and various local, independent operators, as well as Walmart, Target, Kroger, Aldi, Lidl, Walgreens, CVS, and RiteAid, among others. Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to secure better arrangements from suppliers than we can. Competition is intense and we believe it will continue to be so, with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others move into or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets and increase the availability of mobile, web-based and other digital technology to facilitate a more convenient and competitive customer online and in-store shopping experience.

​

We believe that we differentiate ourselves from other forms of retailing by offering consistently low prices in a convenient, small-store format. We are able to maintain competitive prices due in part to our low-cost operating structure and the relatively limited assortment of products offered. Purchasing large volumes of merchandise within our focused assortment in each merchandise category allows us to keep our average product





costs low, contributing to our ability to offer competitive everyday low prices to our customers. See “—Our Business Model” above for further discussion of our competitive situation.

​

Our Employees

​

As of February 28, 2020, we employed approximately 143,000 full-time and part-time employees, including divisional and regional managers, district managers, store managers, other store personnel and distribution center and administrative personnel. We have increasingly focused on recruiting, training, motivating and retaining employees, and we believe that the quality, performance and morale of our employees continue to be an important part of our success in recent years. We believe our overall relationship with our employees is good.

​

Our Trademarks

​

We own marks that are registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and are protected under applicable intellectual property laws. We attempt to obtain registration of our trademarks whenever practicable and to pursue vigorously any infringement of those marks. Our trademark registrations have various expiration dates; however, assuming that the trademark registrations are properly renewed, they have a perpetual duration. We also hold an exclusive license to the Rexall brand through at least March 5, 2026 and the Believe Beauty brand through at least March 23, 2022.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Investment in our Company involves risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below and the other information in this report and other filings that we make from time to time with the SEC, including our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. These risks are not the only risks we face. Our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could also be adversely affected by additional factors that apply to all companies generally or by risks not currently known to us or that we currently view to be immaterial. We can provide no assurance and make no representation that our risk mitigation efforts, although we believe they are reasonable, will be successful.

Economic factors may reduce our customers’ spending, impair our ability to execute our strategies and initiatives, and increase our costs and expenses, which could result in materially decreased sales or profitability.

Many of our customers have fixed or low incomes and limited discretionary spending dollars. Any factor that could adversely affect their disposable income could decrease our customers’ spending or cause them to shift their spending to our lower margin product choices, which could result in materially decreased sales and profitability. Factors that could reduce our customers’ disposable income include but are not limited to high unemployment or underemployment levels or decline in real wages; inflation; higher fuel, energy, healthcare and housing costs, interest rates, consumer debt levels, and tax rates; tax law changes that negatively affect credits and refunds; lack of available credit; and decreases in, or elimination of, government subsidies such as unemployment and food assistance programs.

Many of the economic factors listed above, as well as commodity rates; transportation, lease and insurance costs; wage rates; foreign exchange rate fluctuations; measures that create barriers to or increase the costs of international trade (including increased import duties or tariffs); changes in applicable laws and regulations; and other economic factors, also could impair our ability to successfully execute our strategies and initiatives, as well as increase our cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses (including real estate costs), and may have other adverse consequences that we are unable to fully anticipate or control, all of which may materially decrease our sales or profitability.

Our plans depend significantly on strategies and initiatives designed to increase sales and profitability and improve the efficiencies, costs and effectiveness of our operations, and failure to achieve or sustain these plans could materially affect our results of operations.

We have short-term and long-term strategies and initiatives (such as those relating to merchandising, real estate and new store development, store formats, digital, shrink, sourcing, private brand, inventory management, supply chain, store operations, expense reduction, and technology) in various stages of testing, evaluation, and implementation, which are designed to continue to improve our results of operations and financial condition. The effectiveness of these initiatives is inherently uncertain, even when tested successfully, and is dependent on consistency of training and execution, workforce stability, ease of execution, and the absence of offsetting factors that can influence results adversely. Many of these factors are made even more challenging by the number and diverse geographic locations of our stores and distribution centers and our decentralized field management. Other risk factors described herein also could negatively affect general implementation. Failure to achieve successful or cost-effective implementation of our initiatives could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

The success of our merchandising initiatives, particularly our non-consumable initiatives and efforts to increase sales of higher margin products within the consumables category, further depends in part upon our ability to predict the products that our customers will demand and to identify and timely respond to evolving trends in demographic mixes in our markets and consumer preferences. If we are unable to select and timely obtain





products that are attractive to customers and at costs that allow us to sell them at an acceptable profit, or to effectively market such products, it could result in materially decreased sales and profitability.

The success of our DG Fresh initiative, our cold chain self-distribution initiative, further depends in part on our ability to effectively transition these distribution operations from our current service providers without business disruption, as well as on the availability of certain supply chain resources, including temperature-controlled distribution centers, refrigerated transportation equipment, and drivers. The success of our Fast Track initiative, which is designed to enhance our in-store labor productivity, on-shelf availability and customer convenience, further depends in part on customer interest and adoption of self-checkout, our ability to gain cost efficiencies and control shrink levels from the initiative, vendor cooperation, and successful implementation and maintenance of the necessary technology.

If we cannot timely and cost-effectively execute our real estate projects and meet our financial expectations, or if we do not anticipate or successfully address the challenges imposed by our expansion, including into new states or urban areas, it could materially impede our planned future growth and our profitability.

Delays in or failure to complete a significant portion of our real estate projects, or failure to meet our financial expectations for these projects, could materially adversely affect our growth and our profitability. Our ability to timely open, relocate and remodel profitable stores and expand into additional market areas is a key component of our planned future growth and may depend in part on: the availability of suitable store locations and capital funding; the absence of entitlement process or occupancy delays, including zoning restrictions and moratoria on small box discount retail development passed by local governments; the ability to negotiate acceptable lease and development terms (for example, real estate development requirements and cost of building materials and labor), to cost-effectively hire and train new personnel, especially store managers, and to identify and accurately assess sufficient customer demand; and general economic conditions.

We also may not anticipate or successfully address all of the challenges imposed by the expansion of our operations, including into new states or urban areas where we have limited or no meaningful experience or brand recognition. Those areas may have different competitive and market conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, as well as higher cost of entry and operating costs. These factors may cause our new stores to be less profitable than stores in our existing markets, which could slow future growth in these areas. In addition, many new stores will be located in areas where we have existing stores, which inadvertently may temporarily or permanently divert a larger than anticipated number of customers and sales from our existing stores, thereby adversely affecting our overall financial performance.

We face intense competition that could limit our growth opportunities and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

The retail business is highly competitive with respect to price, customers, store location, merchandise quality, product assortment and presentation, service offerings, in-stock consistency, customer service, ease of shopping experience, promotional activity, employees, and market share. We compete with discount stores and many other retailers, including mass merchandise, warehouse club, grocery, drug, convenience, variety, online retailers, and certain specialty stores. To maintain our competitive position, we may be required to lower prices, either temporarily or permanently, and may have limited ability to increase prices in response to increased costs, resulting in lower margins and reduced profitability.  Certain of our competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources, and may be able to secure better arrangements with suppliers, than we can.

Competition is intense, and is expected to continue to be so, with certain competitors reducing their store locations while others enter or increase their presence in our geographic and product markets (including through the expansion of availability of delivery services) and expand availability of mobile, web-based and other digital





technologies to facilitate a more convenient and competitive online and in-store shopping experience. If our competitors or others were to enter our industry in a significant way, including through alliances or other business combinations, it could significantly alter the competitive dynamics of the retail marketplace and result in competitors with greatly improved competitive positions, which could materially affect our financial performance. Our ability to effectively compete will depend substantially upon our continued ability to develop and execute compelling and cost-effective strategies and initiatives. If we fail to anticipate or respond effectively to competitive pressures and industry changes, it could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Inventory shrinkage may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition.

We experience significant inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, higher rates of inventory shrinkage or increased security or other costs to combat inventory theft could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to reduce inventory shrinkage.

Our cash flows from operations, profitability and financial condition may be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory balances.

Our inventory balance represented approximately 55% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill, operating lease assets, and other intangible assets as of January 31, 2020. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. We must maintain sufficient inventory levels and an appropriate product mix to meet our customers’ demands without allowing those levels to increase such that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impacts our financial results or increases the risk of inventory shrinkage. If we do not accurately predict customer trends, spending levels, or price sensitivity, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely affect our financial results. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot make assurances that we will be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our cash flows from operations and financial condition may be negatively affected.

Failure to maintain the security of our business, customer, employee or vendor information or to comply with privacy laws could expose us to litigation, government enforcement actions and costly response measures, and could materially harm our reputation and affect our business and financial performance.

Because we accept debit and credit cards for payment, we are subject to industry data protection standards and protocols, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, issued by the Payment Card





Industry Security Standards Council. Nonetheless, we may be vulnerable to, and unable to detect and appropriately respond to, data security breaches and data loss, including cybersecurity attacks or other breaches of cardholder data.

A significant security breach of any kind experienced by us or one of our vendors, which could be undetected for a period of time, or a significant failure by us or one of our vendors to comply with applicable privacy and information security laws, regulations and standards could expose us to risks of data loss, litigation, government enforcement actions, fines or penalties, credit card brand assessments, negative publicity and reputational harm, business disruption and costly response measures (for example, providing notification to, and credit monitoring services for, affected individuals, as well as further upgrades to our security measures) which may not be covered by or may exceed the coverage limits of our insurance policies, and could materially disrupt our operations. Any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation which could cause us to lose market share as a result of customers discontinuing the use of our e-commerce and mobile applications or debit or credit cards in our stores or not shopping in our stores altogether and could materially adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Material damage or interruptions to our information systems as a result of external factors, staffing shortages or challenges in maintaining or updating our existing technology or developing or implementing new technology could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.

We depend on a variety of information technology systems, including systems owned and managed by third-party vendors, for the efficient functioning of our business, including, without limitation, transaction processing and the management of our employees, facilities, logistics, inventories, stores and customer-facing digital applications and operations.  Our technology initiatives may not deliver desired results or may do so on a delayed schedule. Additionally, such systems are subject to damage or interruption from power surges and outages, facility damage, physical theft, computer and telecommunications failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, malicious code (including computer viruses, worms, ransomware, or similar), cyberattacks (including account compromise; phishing; denial of service attacks; and application, network or system vulnerability exploitation), software upgrade failures or code defects, natural disasters and human error. Design defects or damage or interruption to these systems may require a significant investment to fix or replace, disrupt our operations, result in the loss or corruption of critical data, and harm our reputation, all of which could materially adversely affect our business or results of operations.

We also rely heavily on our information technology staff. Failure to meet these staffing needs may negatively affect our ability to fulfill our technology initiatives while continuing to provide maintenance on existing systems. We rely on third parties to maintain and periodically upgrade many of these systems so that they can continue to support our business. We license the software programs supporting many of our systems from independent software developers. The inability of these vendors, developers or us to continue to maintain and upgrade these systems and software programs could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations if we were unable to convert to alternate systems in an efficient and timely manner and could expose us to greater risk of a cyberattack. In addition, costs and delays associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology, including the migration of applications to the cloud, or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems also could disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations, fail to operate as designed, result in the potential loss or corruption of data or information, disrupt operations and affect our ability to meet business and reporting requirements and adversely affect our profitability.

​





A significant disruption to our distribution network, the capacity of our distribution centers or the timely receipt of inventory could adversely affect sales or increase our transportation costs, which would decrease our profitability.

We maintain a network of distribution facilities and are moving forward with plans to build or lease new facilities to support our growth objectives and strategic initiatives. Delays in opening such facilities could adversely affect our financial performance by slowing store growth or the rollout of certain strategic initiatives such as our DG Fresh initiative, which may in turn reduce revenue growth, or by increasing transportation and product costs. In addition, distribution-related construction or expansion projects entail risks that could cause delays and cost overruns, such as: shortages of materials or skilled labor; work stoppages; unforeseen construction, scheduling, engineering, environmental or geological problems; weather interference; fires or other casualty losses; and unanticipated cost increases. For these reasons, the completion date and ultimate cost of these projects could differ significantly from initial expectations, and we cannot guarantee that any project will be completed on time or within established budgets.

Risks associated with or faced by our suppliers could adversely affect our financial performance.

We source our merchandise from a wide variety of domestic and international suppliers, and we depend on them to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner. In 2019, our two largest suppliers each accounted for approximately 8% of our purchases. If one or more of our current sources of supply became unavailable, we believe we generally would be able to obtain alternative sources, but it could increase our merchandise costs and supply chain lead time, result in a temporary reduction in store inventory levels, and reduce the selection and quality of our merchandise. An inability to obtain alternative sources could materially decrease our sales. Additionally, if a supplier fails to deliver on its commitments, we could experience merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and reputational harm. Further, failure of suppliers to meet our compliance protocols could prolong our procurement lead time, resulting in lost sales and adverse margin impact.

We directly imported approximately 6% of our purchases (measured at cost) in 2019, but many of our domestic vendors directly import their products or components of their products. Changes to the prices and flow of these goods for any reason, such as political unrest, acts of war, currency fluctuations, disruptions in maritime lanes, port labor disputes, economic conditions and instability in countries in which foreign suppliers are located, the financial instability of suppliers, failure to meet our standards, issues with our suppliers’ labor practices or labor problems they may experience (such as strikes, stoppages or slowdowns, which could also increase labor costs during and following the disruption), the availability and cost of raw materials, pandemic outbreaks, merchandise quality or safety issues, transport availability and cost, increases in wage rates and taxes, transport





security, inflation, and other factors relating to suppliers and the countries in which they are located or from which they import, often are beyond our control and could adversely affect our operations and profitability.

Product liability, product recall or other product safety or labeling claims could adversely affect our business, reputation and financial performance.

We are dependent on our vendors to ensure that the products we buy from them comply with applicable product safety and labeling laws and regulations and to inform us of all applicable restrictions on the sale of such products.  Nonetheless, product liability, personal injury or other claims may be asserted against us relating to product contamination, tampering, expiration, mislabeling, recall and other safety or labeling issues, including those relating to products that we may self-distribute through our DG Fresh initiative.

We seek but may not be successful in obtaining contractual indemnification and insurance coverage from our vendors. If we do not have adequate contractual indemnification or insurance available, such claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our ability to obtain indemnification from foreign vendors may be hindered by our ability to obtain jurisdiction over them to enforce contractual obligations. Even with adequate insurance and indemnification, such claims could significantly harm our reputation and consumer confidence in our products and we could incur significant litigation expenses, which also could materially affect our results of operations even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or not fully pursued.

A significant change in governmental regulations and requirements could materially increase our cost of doing business, and noncompliance with governmental regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.

We routinely incur significant costs in complying with numerous and frequently changing laws and regulations. The complexity of this regulatory environment and related compliance costs are increasing due to additional legal and regulatory requirements, our expanding operations, and increased regulatory scrutiny and enforcement efforts. New or revised laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations and enforcement practices, particularly those dealing with environmental compliance, product and food safety or labeling, information security and privacy, labor and employment, employee wages, and those governing the sale of products, may significantly increase our expenses or require extensive system and operating changes that could materially increase our cost of doing business. Violations of applicable laws and regulations or untimely or incomplete execution of a required product recall can result in significant penalties (including loss of licenses, eligibility to accept certain government benefits such as SNAP or significant fines), class action or other litigation,





and reputational damage. Additionally, changes in tax laws, the interpretation of existing laws, or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our overall effective tax rate.

Legal proceedings may adversely affect our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.

Our current insurance program may expose us to unexpected costs and negatively affect our financial performance.

Natural disasters and unusual weather conditions (whether or not caused by climate change), pandemic outbreaks or other health crises, acts of violence or terrorism, and global political events could disrupt business and result in lower sales and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance.

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as hurricanes, fires, floods, tornadoes and earthquakes, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks or other health crises (including but not limited to the COVID-19 outbreak), acts of violence or terrorism (including within our stores, distribution centers or other Company property), or disruptive global political events, such as civil unrest in countries in which our suppliers are located, or similar disruptions could adversely affect our reputation, business and financial performance.  If any of these events result in the closure of one or more of our distribution centers, a significant number of stores, or our corporate headquarters or impact one or more of our key suppliers, our operations and financial





performance could be materially adversely affected through an inability to make deliveries or provide other support functions to our stores and through lost sales. These events also could affect consumer shopping patterns or prevent customers from reaching our stores, which could lead to lost sales and higher markdowns, or result in increases in fuel or other energy prices, a fuel shortage, store or distribution center opening delays, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, the temporary or long-term disruption of product availability in our stores, the temporary or long-term inability to obtain technology needed to effectively run our business, and disruption of our utility services or information systems. These events may also increase the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage.

Failure to attract, train and retain qualified employees while controlling labor costs, as well as other labor issues, could adversely affect our financial performance.

Our future growth and performance, positive customer experience and legal and regulatory compliance depends on our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees while operating in an industry challenged by historically high rates of employee turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs, while controlling our labor costs, is subject to many external factors, including competition for and availability of qualified personnel, unemployment levels, wage rates, minimum wage laws, health and other insurance costs, changes in employment and labor laws or other workplace regulations (including changes in employee benefit programs such as health insurance and paid leave programs), employee activism, and our reputation and relevance within the labor market. If we are unable to attract, train and retain adequate numbers of qualified employees, our operations, customer service levels, legal and regulatory compliance, and support functions could suffer. In addition, to the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, or attempts to unionize, our labor and other related costs could increase. Our ability to pass along labor and other related costs to our customers is constrained by our everyday low price model, and we may not be able to offset such increased costs elsewhere in our business.

Our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel. If we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel, our business may be harmed.

Our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any of such persons could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that our executive succession planning, retention or hiring efforts will be successful. Competition for skilled and experienced management personnel is intense, and our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could adversely affect our operations.

Our private brands may not be successful in improving our gross profit rate and may increase certain of the risks we face.

The sale of private brand items is an important component of our sales growth and gross profit rate enhancement plans. Broad market acceptance of our private brands depends on many factors, including pricing, quality, customer perception, and timely development and introduction of new products. We cannot give assurance that we will achieve or maintain our expected level of private brand sales. The sale and expansion of these offerings also subjects us to or increases certain risks, such as: product liability claims and product recalls; disruptions in raw material and finished product supply and distribution chains; inability to successfully protect our proprietary rights; claims related to the proprietary rights of third parties; and other risks generally encountered by entities that source, sell and market exclusive branded offerings for retail. Failure to appropriately address these risks could materially adversely affect our private brand initiatives, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.





Because our business is somewhat seasonal, adverse events during the fourth quarter could materially affect our financial statements as a whole.

Primarily because of sales of Christmas-related merchandise, our most profitable sales mix generally occurs in the fourth quarter.  In anticipation of this holiday, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory, and if sales fall below seasonal norms or our expectations it could result in unanticipated markdowns. Adverse events, such as deteriorating economic conditions, high unemployment rates, high gas prices, transportation disruptions, or unusual or unanticipated adverse weather could result in lower-than-planned sales during the Christmas selling season, which in turn could reduce our profitability and otherwise adversely affect our financial performance and operating results.

Deterioration in market conditions or changes in our credit profile could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.

We rely on the positive cash flow we generate from our operating activities and our access to the credit and capital markets to fund our operations, growth strategy, and return of cash to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing or restrict our access to these potential sources of future liquidity. Our continued access to liquidity sources on favorable terms depends on multiple factors, including our operating performance and credit ratings. Our debt securities currently are rated investment grade, and a downgrade of this rating likely would negatively impact our access to the debt capital markets and increase our cost of borrowing. As a result, disruptions in the debt markets or any downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition and our ability to return cash to our shareholders. We can make no assurances that our ability to obtain additional financing through the debt markets will not be adversely affected by economic conditions or that we will be able to maintain or improve our current credit ratings.

New accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect our financial performance.

The implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems, internal process and controls and other changes that could increase our operating costs, and will result in changes to our financial statements. In 2019 for example, the implementation of accounting standards related to leases, as issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, required us to make significant changes to our lease management and other accounting systems, and resulted in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.

U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to our business involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by our management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or in underlying management assumptions, estimates or judgments could significantly change our reported or expected financial performance. The outcome of such changes could include litigation or regulatory actions which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

​

Most of our stores are located in leased premises. Individual store leases vary as to their terms, rental provisions and expiration dates. Many stores, including a significant portion of our new stores, are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options. We also have stores subject to shorter-term leases, and many of these leases have renewal options.

​

As of February 28, 2020, we operated 17 distribution centers for non-refrigerated merchandise with approximately 16.9 million square feet, four of which are leased and the remainder of which are owned. Approximately 7.25 acres of the land for one of the distribution centers is subject to a ground lease. We also leased approximately 1.1 million square feet of warehouse space in support of our distribution network for non-refrigerated merchandise. In addition, we operated five cold storage distribution centers with approximately 1.1 million square feet, four of which are leased and one of which is owned, and we have executed leases for two additional cold storage distribution centers with approximately 0.7 million square feet, which are expected to be operational later in 2020.

​

Our executive offices are located in approximately 302,000 square feet of owned buildings and approximately 42,000 square feet of leased office space in Goodlettsville, Tennessee.

Executive Overview

​

We are among the largest discount retailers in the United States by number of stores, with 16,368 stores located in 45 states as of February 28, 2020, with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern United States. We offer a broad selection of merchandise, including consumable products such as food, paper and cleaning products, health and beauty products and pet supplies, and non-consumable products such as seasonal merchandise, home decor and domestics, and basic apparel. Our merchandise includes national brands from leading manufacturers, as well as our own private brand selections with prices at substantial discounts to national brands. We offer our customers these national brand and private brand products at everyday low prices (typically $10 or less) in our convenient small-box locations.

​

We believe our convenient store formats, locations, and broad selection of high-quality products at compelling values have driven our substantial growth and financial success over the years and through a variety of economic cycles. We are mindful that the majority of our customers are value-conscious, and many have low and/or fixed incomes. As a result, we are intensely focused on helping our customers make the most of their spending dollars. Our core customers are often among the first to be affected by negative or uncertain economic conditions and among the last to feel the effects of improving economic conditions particularly when trends are inconsistent and of an uncertain duration. The primary macroeconomic factors that affect our core customers include the unemployment and underemployment rates, wage growth, changes in U.S. and global trade policy (including price increases from tariffs), and changes to certain government assistance programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Additionally, our customers are impacted by increases in those expenses that generally comprise a large portion of their household budget, such as rent, healthcare and fuel prices. Finally, significant unseasonable or unusual weather patterns can impact customer shopping behaviors.

​

We remain committed to the following long-term operating priorities as we consistently strive to improve our performance while retaining our customer-centric focus: 1) driving profitable sales growth, 2) capturing growth opportunities, 3) enhancing our position as a low-cost operator, and 4) investing in our people as a competitive advantage.

​

We seek to drive profitable sales growth through initiatives aimed at increasing customer traffic and average transaction amount. As we work to provide everyday low prices and meet our customers’ affordability needs, we remain focused on enhancing our margins through effective category management, inventory shrink reduction initiatives, private brands penetration, distribution and transportation efficiencies, global sourcing, and pricing and markdown optimization. Several of our sales-driving initiatives are also designed to capture growth opportunities and are discussed in more detail below.

​

Historically, our sales of consumables, which tend to have lower gross margins, have been the key drivers of net sales and customer traffic, while sales of non-consumables, which tend to have higher gross margins, have contributed to more profitable sales growth and an increase in average transaction amount. Our sales mix has continued to shift slightly toward consumables, and, within consumables, slightly toward lower margin departments such as perishables. While we expect some sales mix challenges to persist, certain of our initiatives are intended to address these trends, although there can be no assurance we will be successful in reversing them.

​





We continue to make progress on and invest in certain strategic initiatives that we believe will help drive profitable sales growth and capture long-term growth opportunities. Such opportunities include leveraging existing and developing new digital tools and technology to provide our customers with additional shopping access points and even greater convenience. Additionally, our refreshed approach to our non-consumable product offerings has been implemented in approximately 2,400 stores as of the end of 2019. This merchandising strategy, which is continuing to evolve and help shape our approach to non-consumable categories throughout the chain, offers a new, differentiated and limited assortment that will change throughout the year. As we extend this initiative more broadly, as well as incorporate certain related merchandising efforts throughout our chain, our goal is to continue to improve the shopping experience while delivering exceptional value within key areas of our non-consumable categories.

​

We are continuing our rollout of the “DG Fresh” initiative, a self-distribution model for fresh and frozen products that is designed to enhance sales, reduce product costs, improve our in-stock position and enhance item assortment. We currently operate five DG Fresh distribution facilities, which served more than 6,000 stores as of February 28, 2020.

​

Tariffs on products from China, as applied to both our direct imports and domestic purchases, did not have a net material impact on our financial results in 2019. We believe we can mitigate the potential sales and margin impact of such increased tariffs on our financial results in 2020 through various sourcing, merchandising and pricing efforts. However, as noted above, changes in trade policy that result in higher prices for our customers may negatively impact their budgets, and consequently, their spending, and additional increases in tariff rates or expansion of products subject to tariffs may have a more significant impact on our future business.  There can be no assurance we will be successful in our efforts to mitigate the impacts of existing or future tariffs in whole or in part, including but not limited to any impacts on customer spending.

​

We have limited insight into the extent to which our business may be impacted by the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, and there are many unknowns. While we currently expect delays in the receipt of certain goods in 2020 as a result of this outbreak, we do not currently anticipate a material impact to our financial results in 2020 due to these delays. Further delays in the receipt of goods, or other unanticipated impacts to our supply chain, including on direct imports or goods purchased domestically, our stores or our customers, could have a more significant impact on our future business (including sales), and we are continuing to monitor this evolving situation.

​

To support our other operating priorities, we remain focused on capturing growth opportunities. In 2019, we opened 975 new stores, remodeled 1,024 stores, and relocated 100 stores. For 2020, we plan to open approximately 1,000 new stores, remodel approximately 1,500 stores, and relocate approximately 80 stores for a total of 2,580 real estate projects.

​

We continue to innovate within our channel and are able to utilize the most productive of our various store formats based on the specific market opportunity. We expect that our traditional 7,300 square foot store format will continue to be the primary store layout for new stores in 2020. We expect approximately 1,125 of the planned 1,500 remodels in 2020 to use a higher-cooler-count store format that enables us to offer an increased selection of perishable items, with the traditional store format the primary store layout for the remainder of the real estate projects. Additionally, the majority of both new stores and remodels will incorporate higher-capacity coolers. The acceleration of remodels in 2020 and the increased usage of the higher-cooler-count formats is expected to allow us to capture additional growth opportunities within our existing markets. In addition, our smaller format store (less than 6,000 square feet) is expected to allow us to capture growth opportunities in urban areas. We continue to incorporate lessons learned from our various store formats and layouts into our existing store base with a goal of driving increased customer traffic, average transaction amount, same-store sales and overall store productivity.

​





To support our new store growth and drive productivity, we have continued to make investments in our traditional distribution center network for non-refrigerated merchandise. We began shipping from our distribution centers in Longview, Texas and Amsterdam, New York in January 2019 and December 2019, respectively.

​

We have established a position as a low-cost operator, always seeking ways to reduce or control costs that do not affect our customers’ shopping experiences. We plan to continue enhancing this position over time while employing ongoing cost discipline to reduce certain expenses as a percentage of sales. Nonetheless, we seek to maintain flexibility to invest in the business as necessary to enhance our long-term profitability.

​

We also have launched “Fast Track”, an initiative aimed at further enhancing our convenience proposition and in-stock position as well as increasing labor productivity within our stores. The first phase of Fast Track involved sorting process optimization within our distribution centers, as well as increased shelf-ready packaging, to allow for greater store-level stocking efficiencies, followed by the second-phase pilot of a self-checkout option in a limited number of stores. We have completed the sorting process optimization at all of our non-refrigerated distribution centers.  Additionally, we have launched the self-checkout pilot in a select number of stores. These and certain otherstrategic initiatives will require us to incur upfront expenses for which, in some respects, there may not be an immediate or acceptable return in terms of sales or enhanced profitability.

​

Certain of our operating expenses, such as wage rates and occupancy costs, have continued to increase in recent years, due primarily to market forces. While we expect these increases to persist, certain of our initiatives and plans are intended to help offset these challenges, although there can be no assurance we will be successful in mitigating them.

​

Our employees are a competitive advantage, and we proactively seek ways to continue investing in them. Our goal is to create an environment that attracts and retains talented personnel, particularly at the store level, because employees who are promoted from within our company generally have longer tenures and are greater contributors to improvements in our financial performance. We believe our investments in compensation and training for our store managers have contributed to improved customer experience scores, higher sales and improved turnover metrics.

​

To further enhance shareholder returns, we repurchased shares of our common stock and paid quarterly cash dividends throughout 2019. In 2020, we intend to continue our share repurchase activity, and to pay quarterly cash dividends, subject to Board discretion and approval.

​

We utilize key performance indicators (“KPIs”) in the management of our business. Our KPIs include same-store sales, average sales per square foot, and inventory turnover. Same-store sales are calculated based upon stores that were open at least 13 full fiscal months and remain open at the end of the reporting period. We include stores that have been remodeled, expanded or relocated in our same-store sales calculation. Changes in same-store sales are calculated based on the comparable 52 calendar weeks in the current and prior years. Net sales per square foot is calculated based on total sales for the preceding 12 months as of the ending date of the reporting period divided by the average selling square footage during the period, including the end of the fiscal year, the beginning of the fiscal year, and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters. Inventory turnover is calculated based on total cost of goods sold for the preceding four quarters divided by the average inventory balance as of the ending date of the reporting period, including the end of the fiscal year, the beginning of the fiscal year, and the end of each of our three interim fiscal quarters. Each of these measures is commonly used by investors in retail companies to measure the health of the business. We use these measures to maximize profitability and for decisions about the allocation of resources.

​

A continued focus on our four operating priorities as discussed above, coupled with strong cash flow management and share repurchases resulted in solid overall operating and financial performance in 2019 as





compared to 2018, as set forth below. Basis points, as referred to below, are equal to 0.01% as a percentage of net sales.

​

●Net sales in 2019 increased 8.3% over 2018. Sales in same-stores increased 3.9%, primarily due to increases in average transaction amount and customer traffic. Average sales per square foot in 2019 were $237 compared to $231 in 2018.

​

●Our gross profit rate increased by 14 basis points due primarily to higher initial markups on inventory purchases.

​

●SG&A increased by 9 basis points primarilyreflecting our estimate for the settlement of certain legal matters.

​

●Operating profit increased 8.8% to $2.30 billion in 2019 compared to $2.12 billion in 2018.

​

●The increase in the effective income tax rate to 22.2% in 2019 from 21.1% in 2018 was due primarily tochanges in state income tax laws and income tax benefits arising from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019.

​

●We reported net income of $1.71 billion, or $6.64 per diluted share, for 2019 compared to net income of $1.59 billion, or $5.97 per diluted share, for 2018.

​

●We generated approximately $2.24 billion of cash flows from operating activities in 2019, an increase of 4.4% compared to 2018.

​

●Inventory turnover was 4.4 times, and inventories increased 7.8% on a per store basis compared to 2018.

​

●We repurchased approximately 8.3 million shares of our outstanding common stock for $1.2 billion.

Results of Operations

​

Accounting Periods.The following text contains references to years 2019, 2018, and 2017, which represent fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, February 1, 2019, and February 2, 2018, respectively. Our fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. Fiscal years 2019, 2018 and 2017 were each 52-week accounting periods.

​

Seasonality. The nature of our business is somewhat seasonal. Primarily because of sales of Christmas-related merchandise, operating profit in our fourth quarter (November, December and January) has historically been higher than operating profit achieved in each of the first three quarters of the fiscal year. Expenses, and to a greater extent operating profit, vary by quarter. Results of a period shorter than a full year may not be indicative of results expected for the entire year. Furthermore, the seasonal nature of our business may affect comparisons between periods.

​

Net Sales. The net sales increase in 2019 reflects a same-store sales increase of 3.9% compared to 2018. In 2019, our 15,209 same-stores accounted for sales of $26.4 billion. The increase in same-store sales primarily reflects an increase in average transaction amount and customer traffic compared to 2018. The increase in average transaction amount was driven by higher average item retail prices. Same-store sales in 2019 increased in each of the consumables, seasonal and home products and apparel categories, compared to 2018. The 2019 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

​

The net sales increase in 2018 reflects a same-store sales increase of 3.2% compared to 2017. In 2018, our 14,283 same-stores accounted for sales of $23.9 billion. The increase in same-store sales primarily reflects an increase in average transaction amount relative to 2017. The increase in average transaction amount was driven by higher average item retail prices and to a lesser extent, an increase in average items per transaction, while customer traffic was essentially unchanged. Same-store sales in 2018 increased in the consumables, seasonal and home products categories, and declined in the apparel category, compared to 2017. Same-store sales results in 2018 for the three non-consumables categories, when aggregated, were positive. The 2018 net sales increase was positively affected by new stores, modestly offset by sales from closed stores.

​

Of our four major merchandise categories, the consumables category, which generally has a lower gross profit rate than the other three categories, is our largest category and has continued to become a larger percentage





of our total sales. Because of the impact of sales mix on gross profit, we continually review our merchandise mix and strive to adjust it when appropriate.

​

Gross Profit.In 2019, gross profit increased by 8.8%, and as a percentage of net sales increased by 14 basis points to 30.6% compared to 2018.  Higher initial markups on inventory purchases and a lower LIFO provision contributed to the increase in the gross profit rate. These factors were partially offset by increased distribution and transportation costs, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories, and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, as well as a higher rate of inventory shrinkage.

​

In 2018, gross profit increased by 8.1%, and as a percentage of net sales decreased by 32 basis points to 30.5% compared to 2017.  Higher markdowns, a greater proportion of sales of consumables, which generally have a lower gross profit rate than our other product categories, and sales of lower margin products comprising a higher proportion of consumables sales, as well as increases in transportation costs and an increased LIFO provision reduced the gross profit rate. These factors were partially offset by an improved rate of inventory shrinkage and higher initial markups on inventory purchases.

​

SG&A.SG&A as a percentage of sales was 22.3% in 2019 compared to 22.2% in 2018, an increase of 9 basis points. We recorded expenses of $31.0 million in 2019 reflecting our estimate for the settlement of significant legal matters discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. SG&A in 2019 included a decrease of approximately $22.8 million in hurricane and other disaster-related expenses compared to 2018 as well as an increase in retail labor costs at a rate less than the increase in net sales.

​

SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by 1 basis point, rounding to 22.2% in both 2018 and 2017. The 2018 amounts reflect a reduction in repairs and maintenance expenses which were offset by occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, each of which increased at a rate greater than the increase in net sales. The 2018 amounts reflect an increase in hurricane and other disaster-related expenses of approximately $14.3 million compared to 2017. The 2017 amounts include costs of $24.0 million related to the closure of 35 underperforming stores, primarily expenses for remaining lease liabilities.

​

Interest Expense.  Interest expense increased $0.7 million to $100.6 million in 2019 compared to 2018, and increased $2.8 million to $99.9 million in 2018 compared to 2017. See the detailed discussion under “Liquidity and Capital Resources” regarding the financing of various long-term obligations.

​

We had consolidated outstanding variable-rate debt of $430.1 million and $373.3 million as of January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, respectively, and the remainder of our outstanding indebtedness as of each of those dates was fixed rate debt.

​

Other (income) expense. Other (income) expense in 2018 reflects expenses associated with the voluntary prepayment of our senior unsecured term loan facility, and in 2017 reflects expenses associated with the issuance and refinancing of long-term debt.



​

Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for 2019 was 22.2% compared to a rate of 21.1% for 2018 which represents a net increase of 1.1 percentage points. The effective income tax rate was higher in 2019 primarily due to an increase in income taxes resulting from changes in state income tax laws and a federal income tax benefit arising from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019.

​

The effective income tax rate for 2018 was 21.1% compared to a rate of 19.3% for 2017 which represents a net increase of 1.8 percentage points. The effective income tax rate was higher in 2018 primarily due to the one-time remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21% in 2017, which was offset by the reduction in the current federal tax rate from 33.7% in 2017 to 21% in 2018.

​





Our 2017 provision for income taxes reflected an estimate due to the changes in the federal income tax law arising from the TCJA, signed into law on December 22, 2017.  The provisional tax benefit consisted of $310.8 million related to the one-time remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the 21% rate and $24.2 million related to the reduced statutory tax rate of 33.7%, compared to 35% in prior years. Subsequent to the signing of the TCJA, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact is still under analysis.  In 2018, we concluded our analysis of the accounting impact of the TCJA pursuant to SAB 118 and recorded immaterial adjustments related to our 2017 provision for income taxes.

​

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements

​

We are not party to any material off balance sheet arrangements.

​

Effects of Inflation

​

In 2019 and 2018, we experienced increases in product costs due in part to tariffs on certain items imported from China. We experienced minimal overall commodity cost inflation or deflation in 2017.

​



Liquidity and Capital Resources

​

Current Financial Condition and Recent Developments

​

During the past three years, we have generated an aggregate of approximately $6.2 billion in cash flows from operating activities and incurred approximately $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. During that period, we expanded the number of stores we operate by 2,958, representing growth of approximately 22%, and we remodeled or relocated 3,053 stores, or approximately 23% of the stores we operated as of the beginning of the three-year period. In 2020, we intend to continue our current strategy of pursuing store growth, remodels and relocations.

​

At January 31, 2020, we had a $1.25 billion unsecured revolving credit agreement (the “Revolving Facility”), $2.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes, and a commercial paper program that may provide borrowing availability of up to $1.0 billion. At January 31, 2020, we had total consolidated outstanding debt (including the current portion of long-term obligations) of $2.9 billion, which includes commercial paper borrowings (“CP Notes”) and senior notes, all of which are described in greater detail below. Our borrowing availability under the Revolving Facility may be effectively limited by our CP Notes as further described below. The information contained in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements contained in Part II, Item 8 of this report is incorporated herein by reference.

​

We believe our cash flow from operations, and our existing cash balances, combined with availability under the Revolving Facility, CP Notes and access to the debt markets, will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our current obligations, projected working capital requirements, capital spending and anticipated dividend payments for a period that includes the next twelve months as well as the next several years.  However, our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity may be affected by numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.  Depending on our liquidity levels, conditions in the capital markets and other factors, we may from time to time consider the issuance of debt, equity or other securities, the proceeds of which could provide additional liquidity for our operations.

​

For fiscal 2020, we anticipate potential combined borrowings under the Revolving Facility and CP Notes to be a maximum of approximately $800 million outstanding at any one time, including any anticipated borrowings to fund repurchases of common stock.

​





Revolving Credit Facility

​

On September 10, 2019, we entered into the Revolving Facility consisting of a $1.25 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility of which up to $175.0 million is available for the issuance of letters of credit and which is scheduled to mature on September 10, 2024.

​

Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at our option, either (a) LIBOR or (b) a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate). The applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of January 31, 2020 was 1.015% for LIBOR borrowings and 0.015% for base-rate borrowings. We must also pay a facility fee, payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the Revolving Facility, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility. As of January 31, 2020, the facility fee rate was 0.11%. The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings, the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the Revolving Facility are subject to adjustment from time to time based on our long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.

​

The Revolving Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our (including our subsidiaries’) ability to: incur additional liens; sell all or substantially all of our assets; consummate certain fundamental changes or change in our lines of business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. The Revolving Facility also contains financial covenants that require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio.  As of January 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such covenants.The Revolving Facility also contains customary events of default.

​

As of January 31, 2020, under the Revolving Facility, we had no outstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit of $5.4 million, and borrowing availability of $1.24 billion that, due to our intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program described below, could contribute incremental liquidity of $638.4 million at January 31, 2020. In addition, as of January 31, 2020 we had outstanding letters of credit of $41.4 million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements.

​

Commercial Paper

​

As of January 31, 2020, our consolidated balance sheet reflected outstanding unsecured CP Notes of $425.2 million classified as long-term obligations due to our intent and ability to refinance these obligations as long-term debt. An additional $181.0 million of outstanding CP Notes were held by a wholly-owned subsidiary and are therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.  Under this program, we may issue the CP Notes from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.0 billion outstanding at any time.  The CP Notes may have maturities of up to 364 days from the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.  We intend to maintain available commitments under the Revolving Facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of CP Notes outstanding at any time.  As of January 31, 2020, the consolidated outstanding CP Notes had a weighted average borrowing rate of 1.7%.

​

Senior Notes

​

In April 2013 we issued $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior notes due 2023 (the “2023 Senior Notes”) at a discount of $2.4 million, which are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2023. In October 2015 we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.150% senior notes due 2025 (the “2025 Senior Notes”) at a discount of $0.8 million, which are scheduled to mature on November 1, 2025. In April 2017 we issued $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Senior Notes”) at a discount of $0.4 million, which are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2027. In April 2018 we issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.125% senior notes due 2028 (the “2028 Senior Notes”) at a discount of $0.5 million, which are scheduled to mature on May 1, 2028. Collectively, the 2023 Senior Notes, 2025 Senior Notes, 2027 Senior Notes and 2028 Senior Notes comprise the “Senior Notes”, each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of Senior Notes (as so





supplemented and amended, the “Senior Indenture”). Interest on the 2023 Senior Notes and the 2027 Senior Notes is payable in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year. Interest on the 2025 and 2028 Senior Notes is payable in cash on May 1 and November 1 of each year.

​

We may redeem some or all of the Senior Notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the Senior Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Senior Indenture, each holder of our Senior Notes has the right to require us to repurchase some or all of such holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

​

The Senior Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, our ability (subject to certain exceptions) to consolidate, merge, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries.

​

The Senior Indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of and accrued interest on our Senior Notes to become or to be declared due and payable, as applicable.

​

Rating Agencies

​

Our senior unsecured debt is rated “Baa2,” by Moody’s with a stable outlook and “BBB” by Standard & Poor’s with a stable outlook, and our commercial paper program is rated “P-2” by Moody’s and “A-2” by Standard and Poor’s. Our current credit ratings, as well as future rating agency actions, could (i) impact our ability to finance our operations on satisfactory terms; (ii) affect our financing costs; and (iii) affect our insurance premiums and collateral requirements necessary for our self-insured programs. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our current credit ratings.

(a)Represents obligations for interest payments on long-term debt and includes projected interest on variable rate long-term debt using 2019 year end rates and balances. Variable rate long-term debt includes the Revolving Facility (although such facility had a balance of zero as of January 31, 2020), the CP Notes (which had a





balance of $425.2 million as of January 31, 2020, which amount is net of $181 million held by a wholly-owned subsidiary), and the balance of an outstanding tax increment financing of $4.9 million.

​

(b)We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation, employee health, general liability, property loss, automobile, and third-party landlord claims exposures. As these obligations do not have scheduled maturities, these amounts represent undiscounted estimates based upon actuarial assumptions. Substantially all amounts are reflected on an undiscounted basis in our consolidated balance sheets.

​

(c)Commercial commitments include information technology license and support agreements, supplies, fixtures, letters of credit for import merchandise, and other inventory purchase obligations.

​

(d)Purchase obligations include legally binding agreements for software licenses and support, supplies, fixtures, and merchandise purchases (excluding such purchases subject to letters of credit).

​

(e)We have potential payment obligations associated with uncertain tax positions that are not reflected in these totals. We are currently unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the taxing authorities for the $5.1 million of reserves for uncertain tax positions.

​

Share Repurchase Program

​

Our existing common stock repurchase program had a total remaining authorization of approximately $1.1 billion at January 31, 2020. Under the authorization, purchases may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time subject to market and other conditions. The authorization has no expiration date and may be modified or terminated from time to time at the discretion of our Board of Directors. For more detail about our share repurchase program, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.

​

Other Considerations

​

On March 11, 2020, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36 per share which is payable on or before April 21, 2020 to shareholders of record of our common stock on April 7, 2020. We paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.32 per share in 2019. Although the Board currently expects to continue regular quarterly cash dividends, the declaration and amount of future cash dividends are subject to the Board’s sole discretion and will depend upon, among other factors, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that our Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion.

​

Our inventory balance represented approximately 55% of our total assets exclusive of goodwill, operating lease assets, and other intangible assets as of January 31, 2020. Our ability to effectively manage our inventory balances can have a significant impact on our cash flows from operations during a given fiscal year. Inventory purchases are often somewhat seasonal in nature, such as the purchase of warm-weather or Christmas-related merchandise. Efficient management of our inventory has been and continues to be an area of focus for us.

​

As described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, we are involved in a number of legal actions and claims, some of which could potentially result in material cash payments. Adverse developments in those actions could materially and adversely affect our liquidity.

​

Cash Flows

​

Cash flows from operating activities.Cash flows from operating activities were $2.24 billion in 2019, which represents a $94.4 million increase compared to 2018. Changes in accounts payable resulted in a $428.6 million increase in 2019 compared to a $375.2 million increase in 2018, due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms. In addition, net income increased by $123.1 million in 2019 over 2018. These items were offset by changes in merchandise inventories





which resulted in a $578.8 million decrease in 2019 as compared to a decrease of $521.3 million in 2018. Changes in income taxes in 2019 compared to 2018 are primarily due to the timing of payments for income taxes.

​

Cash flows from operating activities were $2.1 billion in 2018, which represents a $341.4 million increase compared to 2017. Changes in accounts payable resulted in a $375.2 million increase in 2018 compared to a $427.9 million increase in 2017, due primarily to the timing of receipts and payments which was partially impacted by certain changes in payment terms. In addition, net income increased by $50.5 million in 2018 over 2017. These items were offset by changes in merchandise inventories which resulted in a $521.3 million decrease in 2018 as compared to a decrease of $348.4 million in 2017. Changes in income taxes in 2018 compared to 2017 are primarily due to the reduction in the federal income tax rate to 21% from 35% and the timing of payments for income taxes.

​

On an ongoing basis, we closely monitor and manage our inventory balances, and they may fluctuate from period to period based on new store openings, the timing of purchases, and other factors. Merchandise inventories increased by 14% in 2019, by 14% in 2018 and by 11% in 2017. Inventory levels in the consumables category increased by $371.9 million, or 14%, in 2019, by $320.9 million, or 14%, in 2018, and by $322.9 million, or 16% in 2017. The seasonal category increased by $127.3 million, or 17%, in 2019, by $108.4 million, or 17%, in 2018, and by $14.9 million, or 2%, in 2017. The home products category increased by $82.8 million, or 23%, in 2019, by $24.0 million, or 7%, in 2018, and by $10.6 million, or 3%, in 2017. The apparel category decreased by $2.1 million, or 1%, in 2019, and increased by $34.7 million, or 10%, in 2018, and by $1.9 million, or 1%, in 2017.

​

Cash flows from investing activities. Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2019 included the following approximate amounts: $338 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $217 million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $149 million for new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; and $59 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. The timing of new, remodeled and relocated store openings along with other factors may affect the relationship between such openings and the related property and equipment purchases in any given period. During 2019, we opened 975 new stores and remodeled or relocated 1,124 stores.

​

Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2018 included the following approximate amounts: $289 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $242 million for distribution and transportation-related projects; $138 million for new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; and $47 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 2018, we opened 900 new stores and remodeled or relocated 1,165 stores.

​

Significant components of property and equipment purchases in 2017 included the following approximate amounts: $231 million for improvements, upgrades, remodels and relocations of existing stores; $203 million for new leased stores, primarily for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; $176 million for distribution and transportation-related projects; and $30 million for information systems upgrades and technology-related projects. During 2017, we opened 1,315 new stores and remodeled or relocated 764 stores.

​

Capital expenditures during 2020 are projected to be in the range of $925 million to $975 million. We anticipate funding 2020 capital requirements with a combination of some or all of the following: existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, availability under our Revolving Facility and/or the issuance of additional senior notes or CP Notes. We plan to continue to invest in store growth and development of approximately 1,000 new stores and approximately 1,580 stores to be remodeled or relocated. Capital expenditures in 2020 are anticipated to support our store growth as well as our remodel and relocation initiatives, including capital outlays for leasehold improvements, fixtures and equipment; the construction of new stores; costs to support and enhance our supply chain initiatives including new and existing distribution center facilities and our private fleet; technology initiatives; as well as routine and ongoing capital requirements.

​





Cash flows from financing activities. In 2019, we had a net increase in consolidated commercial paper borrowings of $58.3 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the Revolving Facility. We repurchased 8.3 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2019 at a total cost of $1.2 billion, and paid cash dividends of $327.6 million.

​

In 2018, we had net proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes of $499.5 million, redeemed the 2018 Senior Notes for $400.0 million, and made a principal payment on the Term Facility of $175.0 million. We had a net decrease in consolidated commercial paper borrowings in 2018 of $63.3 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the Revolving Facility. We repurchased 9.9 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2018 at a total cost of $1.0 billion, and paid cash dividends of $306.5 million.

​

In 2017, we had net proceeds from the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes of $599.6 million, redeemed the 2017 Senior Notes for $500.0 million, and made a principal payment on the Term Facility of $250.0 million. We had a net decrease in consolidated commercial paper borrowings in 2017 of $60.3 million and had no borrowings or repayments under the Revolving Facility. We repurchased 7.1 million outstanding shares of our common stock in 2017 at a total cost of $579.7 million, and paid cash dividends of $282.9 million.

​

Accounting Standards

​

In January 2017, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent measurement of goodwill. These amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Subsequent to adoption, an entity will perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition.  Wedo not anticipate a material effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to result from the adoption of this guidance.

​

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

​

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. In addition to the estimates presented below, there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation, but are not deemed critical as defined below. We believe these estimates are reasonable and appropriate. However, if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used, the resulting changes could have a material effect on the financial statements taken as a whole.

​

Management believes the following policies and estimates are critical because they involve significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below relating to those policies and estimates. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our principal accounting policies.

​

Merchandise Inventories. Merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”) with cost determined using the retail last in, first out (“LIFO”) method.  We use the retail inventory method (“RIM”) to calculate gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost, which are computed utilizing a calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio at an inventory department level. We apply the RIM to these departments, which are groups of products that are fairly uniform in terms of cost, selling price relationship and turnover. The





RIM will result in valuing inventories at LCM if permanent markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Inherent in the RIM calculation are certain management judgments and estimates that may impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as the gross profit recognized. These judgments include ensuring departments consist of similar products, recording estimated shrinkage between physical inventories, and timely recording of markdowns needed to sell inventory.

​

We perform an annual LIFO analysis whereby all merchandise units are considered for inclusion in the index formulation. An actual valuation of inventory under the LIFO method is made at the end of each year based on the inventory levels and costs at that time. In contrast, interim LIFO calculations are based on management’s annual estimates of sales, the rate of inflation or deflation, and year-end inventory levels. We also perform analyses for determining obsolete inventory, adjusting inventory on a quarterly basis to an LCM value based on various management assumptions including estimated below cost markdowns not yet recorded, but required to liquidate such inventory in future periods.

​

Factors considered in the determination of markdowns include current and anticipated demand based on changes in competitors’ practices, consumer preferences, consumer spending, significant weather events and unseasonable weather patterns. Certain of these factors are outside of our control and may result in greater than estimated markdowns to entice consumer purchases of excess inventory. The amount and timing of markdowns may vary significantly from year to year.

​

We perform physical inventories in virtually all of our stores on an annual basis. We calculate our shrink provision based on actual physical inventory results during the fiscal period and an accrual for estimated shrink occurring subsequent to a physical inventory through the end of the fiscal reporting period. This accrual is calculated as a percentage of sales at each retail store, at a department level, based on the store’s most recent historical shrink rate. To the extent that subsequent physical inventories yield different results than the estimated accrual, our effective shrink rate for a given reporting period will include the impact of adjusting to the actual results.

​

We believe our estimates and assumptions related to the application of the RIM results in a merchandise inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost on a consistent basis.

​

Impairment of Long-lived Assets.Impairment of long-lived assets results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets. Our estimate of undiscounted future store cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and are difficult to predict. If our estimates of future cash flows are not materially accurate, our impairment analysis could be impacted accordingly. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon projected future cash flows (discounted at our credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Although not currently anticipated, changes in these estimates, assumptions or projections could materially affect the determination of fair value or impairment.

​

Insurance Liabilities. We retain a significant portion of the risk for our workers’ compensation, employee health, general liability, property loss, automobile and third-party landlord claim exposures. These represent significant costs primarily due to our large employee base and number of stores. Provisions are made for these liabilities on an undiscounted basis. Certain of these liabilities are based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed using actuarial methodologies based on historical claim trends, which have been and are anticipated to continue to be materially accurate. If future claim trends deviate from recent historical patterns, or other unanticipated events affect the number and significance of future claims, we may be required to record additional expenses or expense reductions, which could be material to our future financial results.

​





Contingent Liabilities – Income Taxes.Income tax reserves are determined using the methodology established by accounting standards relating to uncertainty in income taxes. These standards require companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position. Uncertain tax positions require determinations and liabilities to be estimated based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation. If our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to our future financial results.

​

Lease Accounting. We adopted new accounting guidance related to leases as of February 2, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, existing leases were recorded at the adoption date, and comparative periods were not restated and are presented under previously existing guidance. Adoption of the leasing standard resulted in right of use operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities of approximately $8.0 billion each as of February 2, 2019. Significant judgments and estimates were utilized in calculating these initial balances, including the determination of appropriate lease discount rates.

​

Many of our stores are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords, which typically carry a primary lease term of up to 15 years with multiple renewal options. We also have stores subject to shorter-term leases and many of these leases have renewal options. Certain of our stores have provisions for contingent rentals based upon a percentage of defined sales volume. We recognize contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. We record single lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term including any option periods that are reasonably certain to be renewed, commencing on the date that we take physical possession of the property from the landlord which normally includes a period prior to store opening to make necessary leasehold improvements and install store fixtures. When a lease contains a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis. Tenant allowances, to the extent received, are recorded as a reduction of the right of use asset. Improvements of leased properties are amortized over the shorter of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.

​

Share-Based Payments. Our stock option awards are valued on an individual grant basis using the Black-Scholes-Merton closed form option pricing model. We believe that this model fairly estimates the value of our stock option awards. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental in the valuation of stock options, which affects compensation expense related to these options. These assumptions include the term that the options are expected to be outstanding, the historical volatility of our stock price, applicable interest rates and the dividend yield of our stock. Other factors involving judgments that affect the expensing of share-based payments include estimated forfeiture rates of share-based awards. Historically, these estimates have been materially accurate; however, if our estimates differ materially from actual experience, we may be required to record additional expense or reductions of expense, which could be material to our future financial results.

​

Fair Value Measurements.Accounting standards for the measurement of fair value of assets and liabilities establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy). Therefore, Level 3 inputs are typically based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity, and thus require the use of significant judgment and estimates. Currently, we have no assets or liabilities that are valued based solely on Level 3 inputs.

​

Our fair value measurements are primarily associated with our outstanding debt instruments. We use various valuation models in determining the values of these liabilities. We believe that in recent years these methodologies have produced materially accurate valuations.

​









ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

​

Financial Risk Management

​

We are exposed to market risk primarily from adverse changes in interest rates, and to a lesser degree commodity prices. To minimize this risk, we may periodically use financial instruments, including derivatives. All derivative financial instrument transactions must be authorized and executed pursuant to approval by the Board of Directors. As a matter of policy, we do not buy or sell financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes, and any such derivative financial instruments are intended to be used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Our objective is to correlate derivative financial instruments and the underlying exposure being hedged, so that fluctuations in the value of the financial instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the value of the underlying economic exposure.

​

Interest Rate Risk

​

We manage our interest rate risk through the strategic use of fixed and variable interest rate debt and, from time to time, derivative financial instruments. Our principal interest rate exposure relates to outstanding amounts under our Revolving Facility as well as our commercial paper program. As of January 31, 2020, we had consolidated borrowings of $425.2 million under our commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under our Revolving Facility. In order to mitigate a portion of the variable rate interest exposure under the credit facilities, in prior years we have entered into various interest rate swaps. As of January 31, 2020, no such interest rate swaps were outstanding and, as a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in variable interest rates under the Revolving Facility and our commercial paper program. For a detailed discussion of our Revolving Facility and our commercial paper program, see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.

​

A change in interest rates on variable rate debt impacts our pre-tax earnings and cash flows; whereas a change in interest rates on fixed rate debt impacts the economic fair value of debt but not our pre-tax earnings and cash flows. Based on our variable rate borrowing levels as of January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, the annualized effect of a one percentage point increase in variable interest rates would have resulted in a pretax reduction of our earnings and cash flows of approximately $4.3 million in 2019 and $3.7 million in 2018.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

​

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

Dollar General Corporation

​

Opinion on the Financial Statements

​

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”).  In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

​

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated March 19, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

​

Adoption of New Accounting Standard

​

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for lease contracts on February 2, 2019, due to the adoption of ASU 2016-02Leases(ASC 842). See below for discussion of our related critical audit matter.

​

Basis for Opinion

​

These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

​

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

​

Critical Audit Matters

​

The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our





opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

​

​

​Estimate of Workers’ Compensation and General Liability Reserves

​​

Description of the MatterThe Company records expenses and reserves for workers’ compensation matters related to alleged work-related employee accidents and injuries, as well as general liability matters related to alleged non-employee incidents and injuries. At January 31, 2020, the Company’s reserves for self-insurance risks were $240.6 million, which includes workers’ compensation and general liability reserves. As discussed in Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company retains a significant portion of risk related to its workers’ compensation and general liability exposures. Accordingly, provisions are recorded for the Company’s estimates of such losses. The undiscounted future claim costs for the workers’ compensation and general liability exposures are estimated using actuarial methods.​Auditing management’s assessment of the recorded self-insurance exposure reserves was complex and judgmental due to the significant assumptions required in projecting the exposure on incurred claims (including those which have not been reported to the Company). In particular, the estimate was sensitive to significant assumptions such as loss development factors, trend factors, pure loss rates, and projected claim counts.

​​

How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for these self-insurance exposures. For example, we tested controls over the appropriateness of the assumptions management used in the calculation and the completeness and accuracy of the data underlying the reserves.​To test the Company’s determination of the estimated required self-insurance reserves, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the actuarial valuation methodologies utilized by management, testing the significant assumptions discussed above, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its evaluation, and testing the mathematical accuracy of the calculations. We also compared the significant assumptions used by management to industry accepted actuarial assumptions, reassessed the accuracy of management’s historical estimates utilized in prior period evaluations, and utilized an actuarial valuation specialist to assist in assessing the valuation methodologies and significant assumptions used in the valuation analysis, as well as to compare the Company’s recorded reserve to an independently developed range of actuarial reserves.

​





​​​​

​

​Adoption of New Lease Accounting Standard

​​

Description of the Matter

As described above and in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company adopted ASU 2016-02,Leases(ASC 842), on February 2, 2019. The adoption of ASC 842 resulted in the recognition of right-of-use operating lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $8.0 billion as of February 2, 2019. The cumulative effect of adopting the standard resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings of $28.8 million at the same date. Among the elements of management estimation in connection with the adoption was the determination of incremental borrowing rates (“IBR”) which were used to calculate its operating right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Management estimates certain adjustments to observed borrowing rates in order to derive the IBRs that are representative of the rate the lessee would have to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term as the subject lease.

​

Auditing the Company’s adoption of ASC 842 was complex and involved subjective auditor judgement because the Company is party to a significant number of lease contracts, and certain aspects of adopting ASC 842 required management to exercise significant judgment in applying ASC 842 to its portfolio of lease contracts. In particular, auditing management’s estimate of the IBRs used to determine the operating right-of-use assets and lease liabilities was especially challenging and required the evaluation of the significant assumptions utilized by management including the selection of appropriate yield curves and adjustments for collateralization.

​​

How We Addressed the Matter in Our AuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for the adoption of ASC 842. For example, we tested controls over management’s review of the application of accounting policy elections to its portfolio of leases and over management’s review of the estimation of the IBRs.​To test the Company’s adoption of ASC 842, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the completeness of the population of contracts that meet the definition of a lease under ASC 842, testing the accuracy of lease terms by agreement of such terms to the original lease contract, and testing the accuracy of the Company’s calculations of initial right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We involved our specialist to assist in our evaluation of the Company’s methodology, model and significant assumptions utilized in developing the IBRs. We also compared the Company’s IBRs to ranges developed by our specialists based on independently observed data.

​

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

​

1.Basis of presentation and accounting policies

​

Basis of presentation​These notes contain references to the years 2019, 2018, and 2017, which represent fiscal years ended January 31, 2020, February 1, 2019, and February 2, 2018, respectively. The Company’s 2019, 2018 and 2017 accounting periods were each comprised of52-weeks. The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday closest to January 31. The consolidated financial statements include all subsidiaries of the Company, except for its not-for-profit subsidiary which the Company does not control. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated.​The Company sells general merchandise on a retail basis through16,278stores (as of January 31, 2020) in44states with the greatest concentration of stores in the southern, southwestern, midwestern and eastern United States. The Company owns13and leasesfourdistribution centers for non-refrigerated merchandise. At January 31, 2020, the Company also operatedoneowned andfourleased cold storage and distribution facilities.

​

Cash and cash equivalents​Cash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities ofthree monthsor less when purchased. Such investments primarily consist of money market funds, bank deposits, certificates of deposit, and commercial paper. The carrying amounts of these items are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short maturity of these investments.​Payments due from processors for electronic tender transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled approximately $101.9million and $99.5million at January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, respectively.

​

Investments in debt and equity securities​The Company accounts for investments in debt and marketable equity securities as held-to-maturity, available-for-sale, or trading, depending on their classification. Debt securities categorized as held-to-maturity are stated at amortized cost. Debt and equity securities categorized as available-for-sale are stated at fair value, with any unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Trading securities are stated at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded as a component of Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expense.  The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.​

Merchandise inventories​Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market (“LCM”) with cost determined using the retail last-in, first-out (“LIFO”) method as this method results in a better matching of costs and revenues. Under the Company’s retail inventory method (“RIM”), the calculation of gross profit and the resulting valuation of inventories at cost are computed by applying a calculated cost-to-retail inventory ratio to the retail value of sales at a department level. The use of the RIM will result in valuing inventories at LCM if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories. Costs directly associated with warehousing and distribution are capitalized into inventory.​The excess of current cost over LIFO cost was approximately $110.7million and $103.7million at January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, respectively. Current cost is determined using the RIM on a first-in, first-out basis. Under the LIFO inventory method, the impacts of rising or falling market price changes increase or decrease cost of sales (the LIFO provision or benefit). The Company recorded a LIFO provision (benefit) of $7.0





















































million in 2019, $25.2million in 2018, and $(2.2) million in 2017, which is included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of income.​The Company purchases its merchandise from a wide variety of suppliers. The Company’stwolargest suppliers each accounted for approximately8% of the Company’s purchases in 2019.

​

Vendor rebates​The Company accounts for all cash consideration received from vendors in accordance with applicable accounting standards pertaining to such arrangements. Cash consideration received from a vendor is generally presumed to be a rebate or an allowance and is accounted for as a reduction of merchandise purchase costs as earned. However, certain specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying SG&A expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products may be offset by cash consideration received from vendors, in accordance with arrangements such as cooperative advertising, when earned for dollar amounts up to but not exceeding actual incremental costs.

​

Prepaid expenses and other current assets

​

Prepaid expenses and other current assets include prepaid amounts for maintenance, business licenses, advertising, and insurance, and amounts receivable for certain vendor rebates (primarily those expected to be collected in cash) and coupons.

​

Property and equipment​In 2007, the Company’s property and equipment was recorded at estimated fair values as the result of a merger transaction. Property and equipment acquired subsequent to the merger has been recorded at cost. The Company records depreciation and amortization on a straight-line basis over the assets’ estimated useful lives. The Company’s property and equipment balances and depreciable lives are summarized as follows:​​​​​​​​​​​​​​DepreciableJanuary 31,February 1,(In thousands)​Life​2020​2019LandIndefinite​$220,228​$214,632​Land improvements​​20​86,636​85,093​Buildings39-40​1,290,673​1,219,852​Leasehold improvements​​(a)​656,234​583,531​Furniture, fixtures and equipment3-10​3,782,016​3,298,594​Construction in progress​​​​​62,183​117,275​​​​​​​6,097,970​5,518,977​Less accumulated depreciation and amortization​​​​​2,819,611​2,548,171​Net property and equipment​​​​​$3,278,359​$2,970,806​(a)Amortized over the lesser of the life of the applicable lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset.​Depreciation expense related to property and equipment was approximately $500.4million, $454.1million and $403.3million for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest on borrowed funds during the construction of property and equipment is capitalized where applicable. Interest costs of $2.7million, $3.7million, and $2.0million were capitalized in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

​

Impairment of long-lived assets​When indicators of impairment are present, the Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets, excluding goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, in relation to the operating performance and future cash flows or the appraised values of the underlying assets. Generally, the Company’s policy is to review





for impairment stores open more thanthree yearsfor which current cash flows from operations are negative. Impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. The Company’s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to variability and difficult to predict. If a long-lived asset is found to be impaired, the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset’s estimated fair value. The fair value is estimated based primarily upon estimated future cash flows over the asset’s remaining useful life (discounted at the Company’s credit adjusted risk-free rate) or other reasonable estimates of fair market value. Assets to be disposed of are adjusted to the fair value less the cost to sell if less than the book value.

​

The Company recorded impairment charges included in SG&A expense of approximately $3.6million in 2019, $4.1million in 2018 and $7.8million in 2017, to reduce the carrying value of certain of its stores’ assets. Such action was deemed necessary based on the Company’s evaluation that such amounts would not be recoverable primarily due to insufficient sales or excessive costs resulting in the carrying value of the assets exceeding the estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated by the assets at these locations.

​

Goodwill and other intangible assets

​

If not deemed indefinite, the Company amortizes intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present. Definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment if indicators of impairment are present. Impaired assets are written down to fair value as required.Noimpairment of intangible assets has been identified during any of the periods presented.

​

In accordance with accounting standards for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, an entity has the option first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If after such assessment an entity concludes that the asset is not impaired, then the entity is not required to take further action. However, if an entity concludes otherwise, then it is required to determine the fair value of the asset using a quantitative impairment test, and if impaired, the associated assets must be written down to fair value as described in further detail below.

​

The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step process that would require management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of an entity’s reporting units based on valuation techniques (including a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts) and comparing that estimated fair value with the recorded carrying value, which includes goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an “implied fair value” of goodwill. The determination of the implied fair value of goodwill would require the entity to allocate the estimated fair value of its reporting unit to its assets and liabilities. Any unallocated fair value would represent the implied fair value of goodwill, which would be compared to its corresponding carrying value.

​

The quantitative impairment test for intangible assets compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.

​

The Company’s goodwill balance has an indefinite life and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Substantially all of the Company’s other intangible assets are trade names and trademarks which have an indefinite life.

​

Other assets

​

Noncurrent Other assets consist primarily of qualifying prepaid expenses for maintenance, beer and wine licenses, and utility, security and other deposits.

































​

Accrued expenses and other liabilities

​

Accrued expenses and other consist of the following:

​​​​​​​​​​January 31,February 1,(In thousands)​2020​2019Compensation and benefits​$135,492​$121,375​Self-insurance reserves​109,291​107,380​Taxes (other than taxes on income)​192,656​183,941​Other​271,717​205,709​​​$709,156​$618,405​​

Included in other accrued expenses are liabilities for freight expense, interest, utilities, and maintenance.

​

Insurance liabilities​The Company retains a significant portion of risk for its workers’ compensation, employee health, general liability, property, automobile, and third-party landlord liability claim exposures. Accordingly, provisions are made for the Company’s estimates of such risks which are recorded as self-insurance reserves pursuant to Company policy. The undiscounted future claim costs for the workers’ compensation, general liability, landlord liability, and health claim risks are derived using actuarial methods which are sensitive to significant assumptions such as loss development factors, trend factors, pure loss rates, and projected claim counts. To the extent that subsequent claim costs vary from the Company’s estimates, future results of operations will be affected as the reserves are adjusted.​Ashley River Insurance Company (“ARIC”), a Tennessee-based wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary of the Company, charges the operating subsidiary companies premiums to insure the retained workers’ compensation, medical stop-loss, and non-property general liability exposures. Pursuant to Tennessee insurance regulations, ARIC maintains certain levels of cash and cash equivalents related to its self-insured exposures.

​

Leases

​

Effective in 2019, the Company records right of use lease assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet. Lease liabilities are recorded at a discount based upon the Company’s estimated collateralized incremental borrowing rate. Factors incorporated into the calculation of lease discount rates include the valuations and yields of the Company’s senior notes, their credit spread over comparable U.S. Treasury rates, and an index of the credit spreads for all North American investment grade companies by rating. To determine an indicative secured rate, the Company uses the estimated credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification by tenor.

​

Also effective in 2019, the Company records single lease cost on a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable lease term commencing on the date that the Company takes physical possession of the property from the landlord, which may include a period prior to the opening of a store or other facility to make any necessary leasehold improvements and install fixtures. Any tenant allowances received are recorded as a reduction of the right of use asset. Leases with an initial term of12 monthsor less are not recorded on the balance sheet and lease expense for such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company combines lease and nonlease components. Many leases include one or more options to renew, and the exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.

​

For periods prior to 2019, rent expense was recognized over the term of the lease. The Company recorded minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the base, non-cancelable lease term commencing



































on the date that the Company took physical possession of the property from the landlord. When a lease contained a predetermined fixed escalation of the minimum rent, the Company recognized the related rent expense on a straight-line basis and recorded the difference between the recognized rental expense and the amounts payable under the lease as deferred rent. Tenant allowances, to the extent received, were recorded as deferred incentive rent and were amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease. The difference between the calculated expense and the amounts paid result in a liability which was classified in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet, totaling approximately $70.1million at February 1, 2019.​The Company recognizes contingent rental expense when the achievement of specified sales targets is considered probable. The amount expensed but not paid as of January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019 was approximately $2.3million and $2.4million, respectively, and is included in Accrued expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheets.

​

Other liabilities

​

Noncurrent Other liabilities consist of the following:

​​​​​​​​​​January 31,February 1,(In thousands)​2020​2019Self-insurance reserves​$131,281​$130,022​Deferred rent​—​70,139​Deferred gain on sale leaseback​—​40,303​Other​41,395​57,897​​​$172,676​$298,361​

​

The deferred rent balance was reclassified and the deferred gain on sale leaseback balance was eliminated on February 2, 2019 as a result of the adoption of a new lease accounting standard discussed in greater detail in Note 1 and Note 4 below.

​

Fair value accounting

​

The Company utilizes accounting standards for fair value, which include the definition of fair value, the framework for measuring fair value, and disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, fair value accounting standards establish a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity (observable inputs that are classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity’s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).

​

Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, as well as inputs that are observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, which are based on an entity’s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, observable market activity. In instances where the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.

​





Other comprehensive income​The Company previously recorded a loss on the settlement of derivatives associated with the issuance of long-term debt in 2013 which was deferred to other comprehensive income and is being amortized as an increase to interest expense over the10-yearperiod of the debt’s maturity.

​

Revenue recognition​The Company recognizes retail sales in its stores at the time the customer takes possession of merchandise. All sales are net of discounts and are presented net of taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed concurrent with those sales.​The Company recognizes gift card sales revenue at the time of redemption. The liability for gift cards is established for the cash value at the time of purchase of the gift card. The liability for outstanding gift cards was approximately $6.0million and $5.2million at January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, respectively, and is recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities. Estimated breakage revenue, a percentage of gift cards that will never be redeemed based on historical redemption rates, is recognized over time in proportion to actual gift card redemptions. The Company recorded breakage revenue of $1.0million, $0.8million and $0.6million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

​

Advertising costs​Advertising costs are expensed upon performance, “first showing” or distribution, and are reflected in SG&A expenses net of earned cooperative advertising amounts provided by vendors which are specific, incremental and otherwise qualifying expenses related to the promotion or sale of vendor products for dollar amounts up to but not exceeding actual incremental costs. Advertising costs were $91.0million, $70.5million and $68.8million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These costs primarily include promotional circulars, targeted circulars supporting new stores, television and radio advertising, and in-store signage. Vendor funding for cooperative advertising offset reported expenses by $34.7million, $35.0million and $33.8million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.

​

Share-based payments

​

The Company recognizes compensation expense for share-based compensation based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period. This estimate may be adjusted periodically based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from the prior estimate. The forfeiture rate is the estimated percentage of share-based awards granted that are expected to be forfeited or canceled before becoming fully vested. The Company bases this estimate on historical experience or estimates of future trends, as applicable. An increase in the forfeiture rate will decrease compensation expense.

​

The fair value of each option grant is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense on a straight-line basis between the applicable grant date and each vesting date. The Company has estimated the fair value of all stock option awards as of the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense.

​

The Company calculates compensation expense for restricted stock, share units and similar awards as the difference between the market price of the underlying stock or similar award on the grant date and the purchase price, if any. Such expense is recognized on a straight-line basis for time-based awards and on an accelerated or straight-line basis for performance awards depending on the period over which the recipient earns the awards.

​







Store pre-opening costs​Pre-opening costs related to new store openings and the related construction periods are expensed as incurred.​

Income taxes​Under the accounting standards for income taxes, the asset and liability method is used for computing the future income tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements or income tax returns. Deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the Company’s deferred income tax assets and liabilities.​The Company includes income tax related interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income tax expense.​Income tax reserves are determined using a methodology which requires companies to assess each income tax position taken using a two-step process. A determination is first made as to whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained, based upon the technical merits, upon examination by the taxing authorities. If the tax position is expected to meet the more likely than not criteria, the benefit recorded for the tax position equals the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement of the respective tax position. Uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation. If the Company’s determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate, the resulting adjustments could be material to the Company’s future financial results.​

Management estimates​The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Accounting standards

​

The Company adopted new accounting guidance related to leases as of February 2, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach. Under this approach, existing leases were recorded at the adoption date, and comparative periods were not restated and are presented under previously existing guidance. In addition, the Company elected the package ofpractical expedientspermitted under the transition guidance in the standard, which among other things, allowed the carry forward of historical conclusions for lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs. The Company is accounting for leases with a term of less than one year under the short-term policy election. The Company also elected thepractical expedientto not separate lease components from the nonlease components (typically fixed common-area maintenance costs at its retail store locations) for all classes of leased assets.  The Company chose not to elect the hindsightpractical expedient. Factors incorporated into the calculation of lease discount rates include the valuations and yields of the Company’s senior notes, their credit spread over comparable U.S. Treasury rates, and an index of the credit spreads for all North American investment grade companies by rating. To determine an indicative secured rate, the Company uses the estimated credit spread improvement that would result from an upgrade of one ratings classification by tenor.

​

Adoption of the leasing standard resulted in right of use operating leaseassetsand operating lease liabilities of approximately $8.0billion each as of February 2, 2019. The cumulative effect of applying the standard resulted in an adjustment to retained earnings of $28.8million at February 2, 2019, primarily for the







elimination of deferred gain on a 2013 sale-leaseback transaction. Because the standard was adopted under the modified retrospective approach, it did not impact the Company’s historical consolidated net income or cash flows.

​

In February 2018, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for the reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income which gives entities the option to reclassify to retained earnings tax effects related to items that have been stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”). An entity that elects to reclassify these amounts must reclassify stranded tax effects related to the TCJA’s change in US federal tax rate for all items accounted for in other comprehensive income. These entities can also elect to reclassify other stranded effects that relate to the TCJA but do not directly relate to the change in the federal tax rate. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2019 and recorded a transition adjustment of $0.9million, which is reflected as a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

​

In October 2016, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to accounting for intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory, which affected the Company’s historical accounting for intra-entity transfers of certain intangible assets. This guidance was effective for the Company in 2018. The amendments were applied on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company adopted this guidance effective February 3, 2018 which resulted in an increase in deferred income taxliabilitiesand a decrease in retained earnings of $41.3million.

​

In January 2017, the FASB issued amendments to existing guidance related to the subsequent measurement of goodwill. These amendments modify the concept of impairment from the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value to the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. Subsequent to adoption, an entity will perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.  The amendments should be applied on a prospective basis. An entity is required to disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle upon transition.  The Company does not anticipate a material effect on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows to result from the adoption of this guidance.

Reclassifications​Certain financial disclosures relating to prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation where applicable.

3.Income taxes​The provision (benefit) for income taxes consists of the following:​​​​​​​​​​​​(In thousands)201920182017Current:​​​​​​​​​​Federal​$368,451​$320,361​$426,933​Foreign​102​159​105​State​65,215​53,091​79,011​​​433,768​373,611​506,049​Deferred:​​​​​​​​​​Federal​45,966​48,262​(159,728)​Foreign​​(15)​​(38)​​(22)​State​9,456​4,109​22,021​​​55,407​52,333​(137,729)​​​$489,175​$425,944​$368,320​​































































A reconciliation between actual income taxes and amounts computed by applying the federal statutory rate to income before income taxes is summarized as follows:

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​(Dollars in thousands)​2019​2018​2017U.S. federal statutory rate on earnings before income taxes$462,36421.0%$423,23721.0%$643,32633.7%Impact of federal tax rate changes​​—​—​​(12,222)​(0.6)​​(310,756)​(16.3)​State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit​60,9362.8​44,5842.2​61,2013.2​Jobs credits, net of federal income taxes​(27,768)(1.3)​(27,506)(1.4)​(26,759)(1.4)​Increase (decrease) in valuation allowances, net of federal taxes​(356)(0.0)​——​4,4350.2​Stock-based compensation programs​​(6,177)​(0.3)​​(3,682)​(0.2)​​(2,227)​(0.1)​Increase (decrease) in income tax reserves​(513)(0.0)​3,9520.2​(1,837)(0.1)​Other, net​6890.0​(2,419)(0.1)​9370.1​​​$489,17522.2%$425,94421.1%$368,32019.3%

​

The effective income tax rate for 2019 was22.2% compared to a rate of21.1% for 2018 which represents a net increase of1.1percentage points. The effective income tax rate was higher in 2019 primarily due to an increase in income taxes resulting from changes in state income tax laws and a federal income tax benefit arising from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “TCJA”) in 2018 that did not reoccur in 2019.

​

The effective income tax rate for 2018 was21.1% compared to a rate of19.3% for 2017 which represents a net increase of1.8percentage points. The effective income tax rate was higher in 2018 primarily due to the one-time remeasurement of the deferred tax assets and liabilities at21% in 2017, which was offset by the reduction in the current federal tax rate from33.7% in 2017 to21% in 2018.

​

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law.  Among other changes, the TCJA reduced the federal corporate tax rate to21% from35% effective January 1, 2018, including a reduction in the Company’s federal corporate tax rate for 2017 to33.7% as a result of the Company’s 2017 fiscal year ending approximately one month after the effective date of the TCJA.

​

The Company’s 2017 provision for income taxes reflected an estimate due to the changes in the federal income tax law arising from the TCJA. The provisional tax benefit consisted of $310.8million related to the one-time remeasurement of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the21% rate and $24.2million related to the reduced statutory tax rate of33.7%, compared to35% in prior years.  Subsequent to the signing of the TCJA, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”), which allowed companies to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year after the enactment date while the accounting impact is still under analysis.  In 2018, the Company concluded its analysis of the accounting impact of the TCJA pursuant to SAB 118 and recorded immaterial adjustments related to its 2017 provision for income taxes.

​

















































































Deferred taxes reflect the effects of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

​​​​​​​​​​January 31,February 1,(In thousands)​2020​2019Deferred tax assets:​​​​​​​Deferred compensation expense​$7,556​$6,490​Accrued expenses​16,788​3,278​Accrued rent​401​22,668​Operating lease liabilities​​2,167,780​​—​Accrued insurance​5,895​6,869​Accrued incentive compensation​16,721​15,219​Share based compensation​​16,321​​15,713​Interest rate hedges​1,076​1,421​Tax benefit of income tax and interest reserves related to uncertain tax positions​164​472​Deferred gain on sale-leaseback​—​11,649​Other​3,702​3,942​State tax net operating loss carry forwards, net of federal tax​555​598​State tax credit carry forwards, net of federal tax​7,534​8,245​​​2,244,493​96,564​Less valuation allowances, net of federal income taxes​(4,077)​(4,433)​Total deferred tax assets​2,240,416​92,131​Deferred tax liabilities:​​​​​​​Property and equipment​(389,080)​(322,575)​Operating lease assets​​(2,143,996)​​—​Inventories​(59,075)​(56,221)​Trademarks​(310,862)​(308,793)​Prepaid insurance​​(11,933)​​(12,639)​Other​(697)​(1,590)​Total deferred tax liabilities​(2,915,643)​(701,818)​Net deferred tax liabilities​$(675,227)​$(609,687)​

​

In the year ended January 31, 2020, the Company recorded a deferred tax asset related to its operating lease liabilities and a deferred tax liability related to its operating lease assets pursuant to the adoption of a new lease accounting standard as described in Note 1 above.

The Company has state tax credit carryforwards of approximately $7.5million (net of federal benefit) that will expire beginning in 2022 through 2028and the Company has approximately$15.6million of state apportioned net operating loss carryforwards, which will begin to expire in 2033 and will continue through 2039.

​

The Company established a valuation allowance for the state tax credit carryforwards, in the amount of $4.4million (net of federal benefit) increasing income tax expense in 2017. In 2019, the Company updated its projections, releasing $0.4million of valuation allowance (net of federal benefit), but management continues to believe that results from operations will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining state tax credits before they expire.

​

Management believes that it is more likely than not that the Company’s results of operations and its existing deferred tax liabilities will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the remaining deferred tax assets.

​

The Company’s 2015 and earlier tax years are not open for further examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The IRS, at its discretion, may choose to examine the Company’s 2016 through 2018 fiscal year income tax filings. The Company has various state income tax examinations that are currently in progress.













































































Generally, with few exceptions, the Company’s 2016 and later tax years remain open for examination by the various state taxing authorities.

​

As of January 31, 2020, accruals for uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to income taxes and potential income tax penalties were $5.1million, $0.4million and $0.0million, respectively, for a total of $5.5million. As of February 1, 2019, accruals for uncertain tax benefits, interest expense related to income taxes and potential income tax penalties were $5.0million, $0.8million and $0.9million, respectively, for a total of $6.7million. These totals are reflected in noncurrent Other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.

​

The Company’s reserve for uncertain tax positions is not expected to be reduced in the coming twelve months as a result of expiring statutes of limitations. As of January 31, 2020 and February 1, 2019, approximately $5.1million and $5.0million, respectively, of the uncertain tax positions would impact the Company’s effective income tax rate if the Company were to recognize the tax benefit for these positions.

​

The amounts associated with uncertain tax positions included in income tax expense consists of the following:

4.Leases​As of January 31, 2020, the Company’s primary leasing activities were real estate leases for most of its retail store locations and certain of its distribution facilities. Many of the Company’s store locations are subject to build-to-suit arrangements with landlords which typically carry a primary lease term of up to15 years. The Company does not control build-to-suit properties during the construction period. Store locations not subject to build-to-suit arrangements are typically shorter-term leases. Certain of the Company’s leased store locations have variable payments based upon actual costs of common area maintenance, real estate taxes and property and liability insurance. In addition, some of the Company’s leased store locations have provisions for variable payments based upon a specified percentage of defined sales volume. The Company’s lease agreements generally do not contain material restrictive covenants.​Most of the Company’s leases include one or more options to renew and extend the lease term. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. Generally, a renewal option is not deemed to be reasonably certain to be exercised until such option is legally executed. The Company’s leases do not include purchase options or residual value guarantees on the leased property. The depreciable life of leasehold improvements is limited by the expected lease term.​

















































All of the Company’s leases are classified as operating leases and the associated assets and liabilities are presented as separate captions in the consolidated balance sheet. At January 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining lease term for the Company’s leases is10.1years, and the weighted average discount rate is4.2%. For 2019, operating lease cost of $1.27billion and variable lease cost of $0.23billion were reflected as selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities of $1.28billion was reflected in cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows for 2019.​The scheduled maturity of the Company’s operating lease liabilities is as follows:​​​​​​(In thousands)​​2020​$1,312,605​2021​1,264,655​2022​1,200,056​2023​1,132,968​2024​1,052,032​Thereafter​4,806,745​Total lease payments (a)​​10,769,061​Less imputed interest​​(1,984,573)​Present value of lease liabilities​$8,784,488​a)Excludes approximately $0.6billion of legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed which have not yet commenced.​Rent expense under all operating leases prior to the adoption of new lease accounting guidance in 2019 is as follows:​​​​​​​​​(In thousands)​20182017Minimum rentals​$1,154,429​$1,075,984​Contingent rentals​4,656​5,532​​​$1,159,085​$1,081,516​​

At January 31, 2020, the Company maintained a $1.25billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) that provides for the issuance of letters of credit up to $175.0million and is scheduled to mature on September 10, 2024.

​

Borrowings under the Revolving Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable interest rate margin plus, at the Company’s option, either (a) LIBOR or (b) a base rate (which is usually equal to the prime rate). The applicable interest rate margin for borrowings as of January 31, 2020 was1.015% forLIBORborrowings and0.015% forbase-rateborrowings. The Company is also required to pay a facility fee, payable on any used and unused commitment amounts of the Revolving Facility, and customary fees on letters of credit issued under the Revolving Facility.  As of January 31, 2020, the facility fee rate was0.11%. The applicable interest rate margins for borrowings, the facility fees and the letter of credit fees under the Revolving Facility are subject to adjustment from time to time based on the Company’s long-term senior unsecured debt ratings.

​

The Revolving Facility contains a number of customary affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the Company’s ability to: incur additional liens; sell all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; consummate certain fundamental changes or change in the Company’s lines of business; and incur additional subsidiary indebtedness. The Revolving Facility also contains financial covenants which require the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. As of January 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants.  The Revolving Facility also contains customary events of default.

​

On June 11, 2018, the Company voluntarily prepaid the entire $175.0million outstanding balance of its senior unsecured term loan facility and recognized an associated loss of $1.0million which is reflected in Other (income) expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended February 1, 2019.

​

As of January 31, 2020, the Company hadnooutstanding borrowings, outstanding letters of credit of $5.4million, and borrowing availability of $1.24billion under the Revolving Facility that, due to its intention to maintain borrowing availability related to the commercial paper program described below, could contribute incremental liquidity of $638.4million. In addition, the Company had outstanding letters of credit of $41.4million which were issued pursuant to separate agreements.

​

As of January 31, 2020, the Company had a commercial paper program under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes (the “CP Notes”) from time to time in an aggregate amount not to exceed $1.0billion outstanding at any time. The CP Notes have maturities of up to364 daysfrom the date of issue and rank equal in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Company intends to maintain available commitments under the Revolving Facility in an amount at least equal to the amount of CP Notes outstanding at any time. As of January 31, 2020, the Company’s consolidated balance sheet reflected outstanding CP notes of $425.2million, which were classified as long-term obligations due to the Company’s intent and ability to refinance these obligations as long-term debt. An additional $181.0million of outstanding CP Notes were held by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company and are therefore not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet. As of January 31, 2020, the outstanding CP Notes had a weighted average borrowing rate of1.7%.

​

On April 10, 2018, the Company issued $500.0million aggregate principal amount of4.125% senior notes due 2028 (the “2028 Senior Notes”), net of discount of $0.5million, which are scheduled to mature on May 1, 2028. Interest on the 2028 Senior Notes is payable in cash on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The Company incurred $4.4million of debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes.

​

Effective April 15, 2018, the Company redeemed $400.0million aggregate principal amount of outstanding1.875% senior notes due 2018 (the “2018 Senior Notes”). There wasnogain or loss associated with the redemption. The Company funded the redemption price for the 2018 Senior Notes with proceeds from the issuance of the 2028 Senior Notes.

​





On April 11, 2017, the Company issued $600.0million aggregate principal amount of3.875% senior notes due 2027 (the “2027 Senior Notes”), at a discount of $0.4million, which are scheduled to mature on April 15, 2027. Interest on the 2027 Senior Notes is payable in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The Company incurred $5.2million of debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the 2027 Senior Notes.

​

On April 27, 2017, the Company redeemed $500.0million aggregate principal amount of outstanding4.125% senior notes due 2017 (the “2017 Senior Notes”), resulting in a pretax loss of $3.4million which is reflected in Other (income) expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended February 2, 2018.

​

Collectively, the 2028 Senior Notes, the 2027 Senior Notes and the Company’s other Senior Notes due 2023 and 2025 as reflected in the table above comprise the “Senior Notes”, each of which were issued pursuant to an indenture as supplemented and amended by supplemental indentures relating to each series of Senior Notes (as so supplemented and amended, the “Senior Indenture”). The Company may redeem some or all of its Senior Notes at any time at redemption prices set forth in the Senior Indenture. Upon the occurrence of a change of control triggering event, which is defined in the Senior Indenture, each holder of the Senior Notes has the right to require the Company to repurchase some or all of such holder’s Senior Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.

​

The Senior Indenture contains covenants limiting, among other things, the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to (subject to certain exceptions): consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets; and to incur or guarantee indebtedness secured by liens on any shares of voting stock of significant subsidiaries.

​

7.Commitments and contingencies

​

Legal proceedings

​

From time to time, the Company is a party to various legal matters in the ordinary course of its business, including actions by employees, consumers, suppliers, government agencies, or others.  The Company has recorded accruals with respect to these matters, where appropriate, which are reflected in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. For some matters, a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated and therefore an accrual has not been made. In 2019, the Company recorded an accrual of$31.0million for losses the Company believes are both probable and reasonably estimable relating to certified class actions and associated matters, including certain wage and hour litigation as well as the matters discussed below under Consumer/Product Litigation.

Except as described below and based on information currently available, the Company believes that its pending legal matters, both individually and in the aggregate, will be resolved without a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole. However, litigation and other legal matters involve an element of uncertainty.  Adverse decisions and settlements, including any required changes to the Company’s business, or other developments in such matters could affect our consolidated operating results in future periods or result in liability or other amounts material to the Company’s annual consolidated financial statements.

Consumer/Product Litigation

In December 2015 the Company was first notified of several lawsuits in which plaintiffs allege violation of state law, including state consumer protection laws, relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of certain Dollar General private-label motor oil. Each of these lawsuits, as well as additional, similar lawsuits filed after December 2015, was filed in, or removed to, various federal district courts of the United States (collectively “Motor Oil Lawsuits”).

On June 2, 2016, the Motor Oil Lawsuits were centralized in a matter styledIn re Dollar General Corp. Motor Oil Litigation, Case MDL No. 2709, before the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri (“Motor Oil MDL”).  In their consolidated amended complaint, the plaintiffs in the Motor Oil MDL sought to certifytwonationwide classes and multiple statewide sub-classes and for each putative class member some or all of the following relief: compensatory damages, injunctive relief, statutory damages, punitive damages and attorneys’ fees.  The Company’s motion to dismiss the allegations raised in the consolidated amended complaint was granted in part and denied in part on August 3, 2017. To the extent additional consumer lawsuits alleging violation of laws relating to the labeling, marketing and sale of Dollar General private-label motor oil have been or will be filed, the Company expects that such lawsuits will be transferred to the Motor Oil MDL.

In May 2017, the Company received a Notice of Proposed Action from the Office of the New Mexico Attorney General (the “New Mexico AG”) which alleges that the Company’s labeling, marketing and sale of certain Dollar General private-label motor oil violated New Mexico law (the “New Mexico Motor Oil Matter”).  The State is represented in connection with this matter by counsel for plaintiffs in the Motor Oil MDL.

On June 20, 2017, the New Mexico AG filed an action in the First Judicial District Court, County of Santa Fe, New Mexico pertaining to the New Mexico Motor Oil Matter.  (Hector H. Balderas v. Dolgencorp, LLC, Case No. D-101-cv-2017-01562).  The Company’s motion to dismiss the action is pending.

On September 1, 2017, the Mississippi Attorney General (the “Mississippi AG”), who also is represented by the counsel for plaintiffs in the Motor Oil MDL, filed an action in the Chancery Court of the First Judicial District of Hinds County, Mississippi alleging that the Company’s labeling, marketing and sale of certain Dollar





General private-label motor oil violated Mississippi law. (Jim Hood v. Dollar General Corporation, Case No. G2017-1229 T/1) (the “Mississippi Motor Oil Matter”). The Company removed this matter to Mississippi federal court on October 5, 2017, and filed a motion to dismiss the action. The matter was transferred to the Motor Oil MDL and the Mississippi AG moved to remand it to state court. (Jim Hood v. Dollar General Corporation, N.D. Miss., Case No. 3:17-cv-801-LG-LRA). On May 7, 2019, the Mississippi AG renewed its motion to remand. The Company’s and the Mississippi AG’s above-referenced motions are pending.

On January 30, 2018, the Company received a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) from the Office of the Louisiana Attorney General (the “Louisiana AG”) requesting information concerning the Company’s labeling, marketing and sale of certain Dollar General private-label motor oil (the “Louisiana Motor Oil Matter”). In response to the CID, the Company filed a petition for a protective order on February 20, 2018 in the 19thJudicial District Court for the Parish of East Baton Rouge, Louisiana seeking to set aside the CID. (In re Dollar General Corp. and Dolgencorp, LLC, Case No. 666499).  On February 7, 2020, the Company reached an agreement with the Louisiana AG to resolve this matter for an amount that is immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole.

On August 20, 2018, plaintiffs moved to certifytwonationwide classes relating to their claims of alleged unjust enrichment and breach of implied warranties. In addition, plaintiffs moved to certify a multi-state class relating to their claims of breach of implied warranties and multiple statewide classes relating to alleged unfair trade practices/consumer fraud, unjust enrichment and breach of implied warranty claims. The Company opposed the plaintiffs’ certification motion. On March 21, 2019, the court granted the plaintiffs’ certification motion as to16statewide classes regarding claims of unjust enrichment and16statewide classes regarding state consumer protection laws.  Subsequently, the court certified an additional class, bringing the total to17statewide classes. The court denied plaintiffs’ certification motion in all other respects. On June 25, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit granted the Company’s Petition to Appeal the lower court’s certification rulings. The Company’s appeal is pending.

The Company is vigorously defending these matters and believes that the labeling, marketing and sale of its private-label motor oil comply with applicable federal and state requirements and are not misleading.  The Company further believes that these matters are not appropriate for class or similar treatment.  At this time, however, except as to the Louisiana Motor Oil Matter, it is not possible to predict whether these matters ultimately will be permitted to proceed as a class or in a similar fashion or the size of any putative class or classes.  Likewise, except as to the Louisiana Motor Oil Matter, no assurances can be given that the Company will be successful in its defense of these matters on the merits or otherwise. Based on its belief that a loss in these matters is both probable and reasonably estimable, during 2019, the Company recorded an accrual for an amount that is immaterial to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as a whole.

8.Benefit plans​The Dollar General Corporation 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan, which became effective on January 1, 1998, is a safe harbor defined contribution plan and is subject to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act (“ERISA”).​A participant’s right to claim a distribution of his or her account balance is dependent on the plan, ERISA guidelines and Internal Revenue Service regulations. All active participants are fully vested in all contributions to the 401(k) plan. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company expensed approximately $25.0million, $20.2million and $17.5million, respectively, for matching contributions.​The Company also has a compensation deferral plan (“CDP”) and a nonqualified supplemental retirement plan (“SERP”), known as the Dollar General Corporation CDP/SERP Plan, for a select group of management and other key employees. The Company incurred compensation expense for these plans of approximately $0.8million in 2019, and $0.7million in each of 2018 and 2017, respectively.​The deferred compensation liability associated with the CDP/SERP Plan is reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as further disclosed in Note 6.





​









































9.Share-based payments

​

The Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with applicable accounting standards, under which the fair value of each award is separately estimated and amortized into compensation expense over the service period. The fair value of the Company’s stock option grants are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are judgmental and highly sensitive in the determination of compensation expense. The fair value of the Company’s other share-based awards discussed below are estimated using the Company’s closing stock price on the grant date. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of valuation and reduce expense ratably over the vesting period.

​

On July 6, 2007, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted the 2007 Stock Incentive Plan, which plan was subsequently amended and restated on several occasions (as so amended and restated, the “Plan”). The Plan allows the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalent rights to key employees, directors, consultants or other persons having a service relationship with the Company, its subsidiaries and certain of its affiliates. The number of shares of Company common stock authorized for grant under the Plan is31,142,858.

​

Generally, share-based awards issued by the Company are in the form of stock options, restricted stock units and performance share units, and unless noted otherwise, the disclosures that follow refer to such awards. With limited exceptions, stock options and restricted stock units granted to employees generally vest ratably on an annual basis overfour-yearandthree-yearperiods, respectively.  Awards granted to board members generally vest over aone-yearperiod. The number of performance share units earned are based on performance criteria measured over a period ofonetothree years, and such awards generally vest over athree-yearperiod. With limited exceptions, the performance share unit and restricted stock unit awards are payable in shares of common stock on the vesting date.

​

The weighted average for key assumptions used in determining the fair value of all stock options granted in the years ended January 31, 2020, February 1, 2019, and February 2, 2018, and a summary of the methodology applied to develop each assumption, are as follows:

​​​​​​​​​​January 31,February 1,February 2,​​2020​2019​2018Expected dividend yield1.1%1.2%1.3%Expected stock price volatility25.3%25.0%25.5%Weighted average risk-free interest rate2.3%2.7%2.1%Expected term of options (years)6.2​6.3​6.3​​

Expected dividend yield - This is an estimate of the expected dividend yield on the Company’s stock. An increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense.

​

Expected stock price volatility - This is a measure of the amount by which the price of the Company’s common stock has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate. An increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense.

Weighted average risk-free interest rate - This is the U.S. Treasury rate for the week of the grant having a term approximating the expected life of the option. An increase in the risk-free interest rate will increase compensation expense.

Expected term of options - This is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding. An increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense.

11.Common stock transactions

​

On August 29, 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program, which the Board has since increased on several occasions. On December 3, 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $1.0billion increase to the existing common stock repurchase program and a cumulative total of $8.0billion has been authorized under the program since its inception. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date and allows repurchases from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and number of shares purchased depends on a variety of factors, such as price, market conditions, compliance with the covenants and restrictions under the Company’s debt agreements and other factors. Repurchases under the program may be funded from available cash or borrowings including under the Company’s Revolving Facility and issuance of CP Notes discussed in further detail in Note 5.

​

During the years ended January 31, 2020, February 1, 2019, and February 2, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately8.3million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.2billion, approximately9.9million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $1.0billion, and approximately7.1million shares of its common stock at a total cost of $0.6billion, respectively, pursuant to its common stock repurchase program.

​

The Company paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.32per share in 2019. On March 11, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.36per share, which is payable on or before April 21, 2020 to shareholders of record on April 7, 2020. The amount and declaration of future cash dividends is subject to the sole discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and will depend upon, among





other things, the Company’s results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, contractual restrictions and other factors that the Board may deem relevant in its sole discretion.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

​

(a)  Disclosure Controls and Procedures.Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.

​

(b)  Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our management prepared and is responsible for the consolidated financial statements and all related financial information contained in this report. This responsibility includes establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles.

​

To comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management designed and implemented a structured and comprehensive assessment process to evaluate the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Such assessment was based on criteria established inInternal Control—Integrated Framework(2013 Framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Because of its inherent limitations, a system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management regularly monitors our internal control over financial reporting, and actions are taken to correct any deficiencies as they are identified. Based on its assessment, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting is effective as of January 31, 2020.

To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of

Dollar General Corporation

​

Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting

​

We have audited Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Dollar General Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria.

​

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2019 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated March 19, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

​

Basis for Opinion

​

The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.

​

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

​

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

​

Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting

​

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

​

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that





controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

ITEM 9B. OTHER INFORMATION

​

Long-Term Incentive Program: 2020 Annual Equity Grants

​

On March 17, 2020, the Company’s Compensation Committee (the “Committee”) awarded 133,723 non-qualified stock options (“Options”) and 28,494 performance share units (“PSUs”) to Mr. Vasos, 32,688 Options and 6,965 PSUs to Mr. Owen, 23,773 Options and 5,066 PSUs to Mr. Garratt and 20,058 Options and 4,274 PSUs to Mr. Reiser on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the form of Option award agreement (as applicable, the “Form Option Agreement”) and form of PSU award agreement (as applicable, the “Form PSU Agreement”) attached hereto respectively as Exhibit 10.38 and Exhibit 10.39 for Mr. Vasos and as Exhibit 10.6 and Exhibit 10.14 for Messrs. Owen, Garratt and Reiser (collectively and as applicable, the “Form Award Agreements”), and subject to the terms and conditions of the previously filed Dollar General Corporation Amended and Restated 2007 Stock Incentive Plan.



The Options, which were granted to each such officer on terms substantially similar to the prior year with the exceptions described below for Mr. Vasos, have a term of ten years and, subject to earlier forfeiture or accelerated vesting under certain circumstances described in the Form Option Agreement, generally will vest in four equal annual installments beginning on April1, 2021. The Form Option Agreement applicable to Mr. Vasos includes additional expiration, forfeiture and accelerated vesting conditions in the event he terminates employment with the Company due to an Early Retirement after April 1, 2021.



The PSUs represent a target number of units that can be earned if certain performance measures are achieved during the applicable performance periods and if certain additional vesting requirements are met. Fifty percent of the target number of PSUs is subject to an adjusted EBITDA performance measure with a performance period of the Company’s fiscal year 2020.  The other fifty percent of the target number of PSUs is subject to an adjusted ROIC performance measure which is the average of adjusted ROIC for the Company’s fiscal years 2020, 2021 and 2022. All performance measures were established by the Committee on the grant date. The number of PSUs earned will vary between 0% and 300% of the target amount based on actual performance compared to target performance on a graduated scale, with performance at the target level resulting in 100% of the target number of PSUs being earned. At the conclusion of each applicable performance period, the Committee will determine the level of achievement of each performance goal measure and the corresponding number of PSUs earned by each grantee.

​

Subject to certain pro-rata vesting conditions, one-third of the PSUs earned by each grantee for adjusted EBITDA performance will vest in equal installments on April 1, 2021, April 1, 2022 and April 1, 2023, in each case subject to the grantee’s continued employment with the Company (except as noted below for Mr. Vasos) and certain accelerated vesting provisions described in the Form PSU Agreement. The Form PSU Agreement applicable to Mr. Vasos includes additional vesting, forfeiture and termination provisions in the event he





terminates employment with the Company due to an Early Retirement after April 1, 2021. Subject to certain pro-rata vesting conditions, the PSUs earned by each grantee for adjusted ROIC performance will vest on April 1, 2023, subject to the grantee’s continued employment with the Company and certain accelerated vesting provisions described in the Form PSU Agreement.

​

For purposes of Mr. Vasos’s Form Award Agreements, Early Retirement means the voluntary termination of his employment with the Company after April 1, 2021, but prior to Normal Retirement (as defined in the applicable Form Award Agreement); provided that: (a) he has provided notice of voluntary termination in writing to the Board within a reasonable period of time prior to the date of his voluntary termination; (b) he has agreed in writing to provide reasonable transition services to the Board and his successor for up to twelve (12) months following his voluntary termination; (c) he agrees in writing to extend the “Restricted Period” of the business protection provisions, including his agreement not to compete and not to solicit, contained in his employment agreement with the Company (the “Business Protection Provisions”) from two (2) years to three (3) years from the date of voluntary termination; and (d) there is no basis for the Company to terminate him with Cause (as defined in the applicable Form Award Agreement) at the time of his voluntary termination.

​

In the event of Mr. Vasos’s Early Retirement after April 1, 2021, the Option shall remain outstanding and become vested and exercisable on the vesting dates described above, subject, however to immediate forfeiture in the event of a violation of any of the Business Protection Provisions following Early Retirement, and to accelerated vesting if he dies or incurs a Disability or there is a Change in Control (each as defined in his Form Option Agreement) following Early Retirement. Subject to such earlier forfeiture, Mr. Vasos will have five (5) years from the date of his termination of employment with the Company due to Early Retirement to exercise vested Options. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company becomes aware of his violation following Early Retirement of any of the Business Protection Provisions, any portion of the Option that vested following Early Retirement shall immediately be forfeited and subject to clawback by the Company and the unvested portion of any Option shall immediately be forfeited.
