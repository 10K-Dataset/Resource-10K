Item 1.  Business.

General Development of Business

▪General:Altria Group, Inc. is a holding company incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia in 1985.  AtDecember 31, 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. ("PM USA"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes and certain smokeless products in the United States; John Middleton Co. ("Middleton"), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco, and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; and UST LLC ("UST"), which through its direct and indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC ("USSTC") and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. ("Ste. Michelle"), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless products and wine.  Philip Morris Capital Corporation ("PMCC"), another wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc., maintains a portfolio of leveraged and direct finance leases.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. held approximately 26.9% of the economic and voting interest of SABMiller plc ("SABMiller") atDecember 31, 2012, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting.

On January 6, 2009, Altria Group, Inc. acquired all of the outstanding common stock of UST.  The transaction was valued at approximately $11.7 billion, which represented a purchase price of $10.4 billion and approximately $1.3 billion of UST debt, which together with acquisition-related costs and payments of approximately $0.6 billion, represented a total cash outlay of approximately $11 billion.  This acquisition was financed with long-term borrowings.  As a result of the acquisition, UST became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc.

On March 28, 2008, Altria Group, Inc. distributed all of its interest in Philip Morris International Inc. ("PMI") to Altria Group, Inc. stockholders in a tax-free distribution.  Following the distribution of PMI, Altria Group, Inc. does not own any shares of PMI stock.  Altria Group, Inc. has reflected the results of PMI prior to the distribution as discontinued operations.  The PMI spin-off resulted in a net decrease to Altria Group, Inc.'s total stockholders' equity of $14.7 billion on the distribution date.  Following the PMI spin-off, Altria Group, Inc. lowered its dividend so that holders of both Altria Group, Inc. and PMI shares would receive initially, in the aggregate, the same dividends paid by Altria Group, Inc. prior to the PMI spin-off.

▪Source of Funds:Because Altria Group, Inc. is a holding company, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  AtDecember 31, 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their common stock.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. receives cash



dividends on its interest in SABMiller, if and when SABMiller pays such dividends.

Financial Information About Segments

Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker has been evaluating the operating results of the former cigarettes and cigars segments as a single smokeable products segment since January 1, 2012.  The combination of these two formerly separate segments is related to the restructuring associated with the cost reduction program announced in October 2011 (the "2011 Cost Reduction Program").  Also, in connection with the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, effective January 1, 2012, Middleton became a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA.  For further discussion on the 2011 Cost Reduction Program, see Note 4.Asset Impairment, Exit, Implementation and Integration Coststo the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K ("Item 8").

Effective with the first quarter of 2012, and at December 31, 2012, Altria Group, Inc.'s reportable segments were smokeable products, smokeless products, wine and financial services.  Net revenues and operating companies income (together with reconciliation to earnings before income taxes) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth in Note 15.Segment Reportingto the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 15").

Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of and allocate resources to the segments.  Operating companies income for the segments excludes general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.  Interest and other debt expense, net (consumer products), and provision for income taxes are centrally managed at the corporate level and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker.  Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by Altria Group, Inc.'s chief operating decision maker.  Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed in Note 3.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, netto the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesto the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ("Note 2").











The relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment were as follows:

201220112010Smokeable products83.7%90.5%84.6%Smokeless products12.513.612.1Wine1.41.40.9Financial services2.4(5.5)2.4100.0%100.0%100.0%



For items affecting the comparability of the relative percentages of operating companies income attributable to each reportable segment, see Note 15.

Effective with the first quarter of 2013, Altria Group, Inc.'s reportable segments will be smokeable products, smokeless products and wine.  In connection with this revision, results of the financial services business and the alternative products business will be combined in an All Other category.  Altria Group, Inc. is making these changes due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc.'s alternative products business to its consolidated results.  Altria Group, Inc. will begin reporting the All Other category and presenting comparable results for prior periods with its 2013 first-quarter results.

Narrative Description of Business

Portions of the information called for by this Item are included in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -Operating Results by Business Segmentof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Tobacco Space

Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco operating companies include PM USA, USSTC and other subsidiaries of UST, and Middleton.  In addition, Altria Group Distribution Company provides centralized sales, distribution and consumer engagement services for Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco operating companies.

The products of Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries include smokeable products, comprised of cigarettes manufactured and sold by PM USA and machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco manufactured and sold by Middleton; and smokeless products manufactured and sold by or on behalf of USSTC and PM USA.  Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch between tobacco categories or use multiple forms of tobacco products and that approximately 30% of adult smokers are interested in spit-free smokeless tobacco alternatives to cigarettes.

▪Cigarettes:PM USA is the largest cigarette company in the United States, with total cigarette shipment volume in the United States of approximately 134.9 billion units in 2012, a decrease of 0.2% from 2011.Marlboro, the principal cigarette brand of PM



USA, has been the largest-selling cigarette brand in the United States for over 35 years.

▪Cigars:Middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco to customers, substantially all of which are located in the United States.  Total shipment volume for cigars was approximately 1.2 billion units in 2012, a decrease of 0.7% from 2011.Black & Mildis the principal cigar brand of Middleton.

▪Smokeless products:USSTC is the leading producer and marketer of moist smokeless tobacco products.  The smokeless products segment includes the premium brands,CopenhagenandSkoal, value brands,Red SealandHusky,andMarlboroSnus, a premium PM USA spit-free smokeless tobacco product.  Substantially all of the smokeless products are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States.  Total smokeless products shipment volume was 763.3 million units in 2012, an increase of 3.9% from 2011.

▪Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors), large retail organizations, including chain stores, and the armed services.

The market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition.  Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions and other discounts, including coupons, product promotions and allowances for new products.

In June 2009, the President signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act ("FSPTCA"), which provides the United States Food and Drug Administration ("FDA") with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations.  The law also grants the FDA authority to extend its application, by regulation, to other tobacco products, including cigars.  The FSPTCA imposes significant new restrictions on the sale, advertising and promotion of tobacco products.  PM USA and a subsidiary of USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of this legislation, and the cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  PM USA, USSTC and other U.S. tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the United States as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions.

In the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers.  Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts.  PM USA also purchases a portion of its United States tobacco requirements











through leaf merchants.  In 2003, PM USA and certain other defendants reached an agreement with plaintiffs to settle a suit filed on behalf of a purported class of tobacco growers and quota-holders. The agreement includes a commitment by each settling manufacturer defendant, including PM USA, to purchase a certain percentage of its leaf requirements from U.S. tobacco growers over a period of at least 10 years.  These quantities are subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement.

Tobacco production in the United States was historically subject to government controls, including the production control programs administered by the United States Department of Agriculture (the "USDA").  In October 2004, the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004 ("FETRA") was signed into law.  PM USA, USSTC, and Middleton are all subject to obligations imposed by FETRA.  FETRA eliminated the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry-funded buy-out of tobacco growers and quota holders.  The cost of the buy-out is approximately $9.5 billion and is being paid over 10 years by manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  The cost is being allocated based on the relative market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  As a result of FETRA, Altria Group, Inc.'s subsidiaries recorded approximately $0.4 billion of charges to cost of sales during each of the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

In February 2011, PM USA filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the USDA's method for calculating the 2011 and future tobacco product class shares that are used to allocate liability for the industry payments that fund the FETRA buy-out described above and used by the FDA to calculate the industry's FDA user fees.  PM USA asserts in this litigation that the USDA violated FETRA and its own regulations by failing to apply the most current federal excise tax ("FET") rates enacted by Congress which became effective in April 2009, in calculating the class share allocations.   PM USA has filed administrative appeals of its FETRA assessments beginning in fiscal year 2011 (all of which have been denied by the USDA) and has submitted a petition for rulemaking with the USDA (which petition was denied by the USDA in November 2011), in each case asserting that the USDA erroneously failed to base the FETRA class share allocations on the current FET rates.  PM USA is appealing the USDA's calculations methodology as well as the denial of the petition for rulemaking and the denial of its quarterly assessment challenges.  The Cigar Association of America has joined the litigation as a defendant intervenor.  In October 2012, the district court dismissed the case over PM USA's objection and the matter is now on appeal.

The quota buy-out did not have a material impact on Altria Group, Inc.'s2012consolidated results, and Altria Group, Inc. does not currently anticipate that the quota buy-out will have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results in 2013 and 2014, when the obligations imposed by FETRA will expire.

USSTC purchases burley, dark fire-cured and air-cured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco



growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants.

Middleton purchases burley and dark air-cured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants.  Middleton does not have a contract growing program.

Altria Group, Inc.'s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.

Wine

Altria Group, Inc. acquired UST and its premium wine business, Ste. Michelle, in January 2009.  Ste. Michelle is a producer of premium varietal and blended table wines.  Ste. Michelle is a leading producer of Washington state wines, primarilyChateau Ste. MichelleandColumbia Crest, and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other wineregions and foreign countries.  Ste. Michelle's total2012wine shipment volume of 7.6 million cases increased 3.7% from2011.

Ste. Michelleholds an 85% ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, which ownsStag's Leap Wine Cellarsin Napa Valley.  Ste. Michelle also ownsConn Creekin Napa Valley andErathin Oregon.  In addition, Ste. Michelle distributesAntinoriandVilla Maria Estatewines andChampagne Nicolas Feuillattein the United States.

▪Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:Key elements of Ste. Michelle's strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines, especially in certain account categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers, and a focus on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products.

Ste. Michelle's business is subject to significant competition, including competition from many larger, well-established domestic and international companies, as well as from many smaller wine producers.  Wine segment competition is primarily based on quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings, competitive wine judging, third-party acclaim and advertising.  Substantially all of Ste. Michelle's sales occur through state-licensed distributors.

Federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the alcohol beverage industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  Further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle's wine business.

Ste. Michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers, as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources.  Grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production.  At the present time, Ste. Michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements.











Financial Services

In 2003, PMCC ceased making new investments and began focusing exclusively on managing its existing portfolio of finance assets in order to maximize gains and generate cash flow from asset sales and related activities.  Accordingly, PMCC's operating companies income will fluctuate over time as investments mature or are sold.

AtDecember 31, 2012, PMCC's investments in finance leases were principally comprised of the following investment categories: aircraft (33%), rail and surface transport (24%), electric power (24%), real estate (13%) and manufacturing (6%).  There were no investments located outside the United States at December 31, 2012.

See Note 7.Finance Assets, net, Note 14.Income Taxesand Note 18.Contingenciesto the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for a discussion of a closing agreement with the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") that conclusively resolved the federal income tax treatment for all prior and future tax years of certain leveraged lease transactions entered into by PMCC.
