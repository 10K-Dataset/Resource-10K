AtDecember 31, 2016, Altria Group, Inc.’s wholly-owned subsidiaries included Philip Morris USA Inc. (“PM USA”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the United States; John Middleton Co. (“Middleton”), which is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of PM USA; and UST LLC (“UST”), which through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, including U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company LLC (“USSTC”) and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates Ltd. (“Ste. Michelle”), is engaged in the manufacture and sale of smokeless tobacco products and wine.  Altria Group, Inc.’s other operating companies included Nu Mark LLC (“Nu Mark”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that is engaged in the manufacture and sale of innovative tobacco products, and Philip Morris Capital Corporation (“PMCC”), a wholly-owned subsidiary that maintains a portfolio of finance assets, substantially all of which are leveraged leases.  Other Altria Group, Inc. wholly-owned subsidiaries included Altria Group Distribution Company, which provides sales, distribution and consumer engagement services to certain Altria Group, Inc. operating subsidiaries, and Altria Client Services LLC, which provides various support services in areas, such as legal, regulatory, finance, human resources and external affairs, to Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries.

At September 30, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate 27% ownership of SABMiller plc (“SABMiller”), which Altria Group, Inc. accounted for under the equity method of accounting.  On

October 10, 2016

, Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“Legacy AB InBev”) completed a business combination with SABMiller in a cash and stock transaction (the “Transaction”).  A newly formed Belgian company, which retained the name Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“AB InBev”), became the holding company for the combined SABMiller and Legacy AB InBev businesses.  Upon completion of the Transaction, Altria Group, Inc. had a

9.6%

ownership of AB InBev based on AB InBev’s shares outstanding at October 10, 2016.  Following completion of the Transaction, Altria Group, Inc. purchased

12,341,937

ordinary shares of AB InBev for a total cost of approximately

$1.6 billion

, thereby increasing Altria Group, Inc.’s ownership to approximately

10.2%

.  At December 31, 2016, Altria Group, Inc. had an approximate

10.2%

ownership of AB InBev, which Altria Group, Inc. accounts for under the equity method of accounting using a one-quarter lag.  As a result of the one-quarter lag and the timing of the completion of the Transaction,

to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 8”).



In January 2017, Altria Group, Inc. acquired the privately-held Sherman Group Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Nat Sherman”).  Nat Sherman sells super-premium cigarettes and premium cigars and joins PM USA and Middleton as part of Altria Group, Inc.’s smokeable products segment.

▪Source of Funds:Because Altria Group, Inc. is a holding company, its access to the operating cash flows of its wholly-owned subsidiaries consists of cash received from the payment of dividends and distributions, and the payment of interest on intercompany loans by its subsidiaries.  AtDecember 31, 2016, Altria Group, Inc.’s principal wholly-owned subsidiaries were not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions with respect to their equity interests.  In addition, Altria Group, Inc. receives cash dividends on its interest in AB InBev if and when AB InBev pays such dividends.

Financial Information About Segments

Altria Group, Inc.’s reportable segments are smokeable products, smokeless products and wine.  The financial services and the innovative tobacco products businesses are included in an all other category due to the continued reduction of the lease portfolio of PMCC and the relative financial contribution of Altria Group, Inc.’s innovative tobacco products businesses to Altria Group, Inc.’s consolidated results.

Altria Group, Inc.’s chief operating decision maker (the “CODM”) reviews operating companies income to evaluate the performance of, and allocate resources to, the segments.  Operating companies income for the segments is defined as operating income before general corporate expenses and amortization of intangibles.  Interest and other debt expense, net, and provision for income taxes are centrally managed at the corporate level and, accordingly, such items are not presented by segment since they are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by the CODM.  Net revenues and operating companies income (together with a reconciliation to earnings before income taxes) attributable to each such segment for each of the last three years are set forth inNote 16.Segment Reportingto the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 16”).  Information about total assets by segment is not disclosed because such information is not reported to or used by the CODM.  Segment goodwill and other intangible assets, net, are disclosed inNote 4.Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, netto the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 4”).The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described inNote 2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesto the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 2”).











The relative percentages of operating companies income (loss) attributable to each reportable segment and the all other category were as follows:

Tobacco Space

Altria Group, Inc.’s tobacco operating companies include PM USA, USSTC and other subsidiaries of UST, Middleton, Nu Mark and Nat Sherman.  Altria Group Distribution Company provides sales, distribution and consumer engagement services to Altria Group, Inc.’s tobacco operating companies.

▪Cigars:Middleton is engaged in the manufacture and sale of machine-made large cigars and pipe tobacco to customers, substantially all of which are located in the United States.  Middleton sources a portion of its cigars from an importer through a third-party contract manufacturing arrangement.  Total shipment volume for cigars was approximately1.4 billionunits in2016, an increase of5.9%from2015.Black & Mildis the principal cigar brand of Middleton.  Nat Sherman sources its premium cigars from importers through third-party contract manufacturing arrangements and sells substantially all of its cigars in the United States.



▪Smokeless tobacco products:USSTC is the leading producer and marketer of moist smokeless tobacco (“MST”) products.  The smokeless products segment includes the premium brands,CopenhagenandSkoal, and value brands,Red SealandHusky.Substantially all of the smokeless tobacco products are manufactured and sold to customers in the United States.  Total smokeless products shipment volume was853.5 millionunits in2016, an increase of4.9%from2015.

▪Innovative tobacco products:Nu Mark participates in the e-vapor category and has developed and commercialized other innovative tobacco products.  In addition, Nu Mark sources the production of its e-vapor products through overseas contract manufacturing arrangements.  In 2013, Nu Mark introducedMarkTene-vapor products.  In April 2014, Nu Mark acquired the e-vapor business of Green Smoke, Inc. and its affiliates (“Green Smoke”), which began selling e-vapor products in 2009.  For a further discussion of the acquisition of Green Smoke, seeNote 3.Acquisition of Green Smoketo the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 (“Note 3”).

In December 2013, Altria Group, Inc.’s subsidiaries entered into a series of agreements with Philip Morris International Inc. (“PMI”) pursuant to which Altria Group, Inc.’s subsidiaries provide an exclusive license to PMI to sell Nu Mark’s e-vapor products outside the United States, and PMI’s subsidiaries provide an exclusive license to Altria Group, Inc.’s subsidiaries to sell two of PMI’s heated tobacco product platforms in the United States.  Further, in July 2015, Altria Group, Inc. announced the expansion of its strategic framework with PMI to include a joint research, development and technology-sharing agreement.  Under this agreement, Altria Group, Inc.’s subsidiaries and PMI will collaborate to develop e-vapor products for commercialization in the United States by Altria Group, Inc.’s subsidiaries and in markets outside the United States by PMI.  This agreement also provides for exclusive technology cross licenses, technical information sharing and cooperation on scientific assessment, regulatory engagement and approval related to e-vapor products.

In the fourth quarter of 2016, PMI submitted a Modified Risk Tobacco Product (“MRTP”) application for an electronically heated tobacco product with the United States Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”) Center for Tobacco Products and announced that it plans to file its corresponding pre-market tobacco product application during the first quarter of 2017.  The FDA must determine whether to accept the applications for substantive review.  Upon regulatory authorization by the FDA, Altria Group, Inc.’s subsidiaries will have an exclusive license to sell this heated tobacco product in the United States.

▪Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:Altria Group, Inc.’s tobacco subsidiaries sell their tobacco products principally to wholesalers (including distributors), large retail organizations, including chain stores, and the armed services.

The market for tobacco products is highly competitive, characterized by brand recognition and loyalty, with product quality, taste, price, product innovation, marketing, packaging and distribution constituting the significant methods of competition.  Promotional activities include, in certain instances and where











permitted by law, allowances, the distribution of incentive items, price promotions, product promotions, coupons and other discounts.

In June 2009, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (“FSPTCA”), which provides the FDA with broad authority to regulate the design, manufacture, packaging, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products; the authority to require disclosures of related information; and the authority to enforce the FSPTCA and related regulations.  The FSPTCA went into effect in 2009 for cigarettes, cigarette tobacco and smokeless tobacco products and in August 2016 for all other tobacco products, including cigars, e-vapor products, pipe tobacco and oral tobacco-derived nicotine products (“Other Tobacco Products”).  The FSPTCA imposes restrictions on the advertising, promotion, sale and distribution of tobacco products, including at retail.  PM USA and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees as a result of the FSPTCA.  Their respective FDA user fee amounts are determined by an allocation formula administered by the FDA that is based on the respective market shares of manufacturers and importers of each kind of tobacco product.  PM USA, USSTC and other U.S. tobacco manufacturers have agreed to other marketing restrictions in the United States as part of the settlements of state health care cost recovery actions.

In the United States, under a contract growing program, PM USA purchases burley and flue-cured leaf tobaccos of various grades and styles directly from tobacco growers.  Under the terms of this program, PM USA agrees to purchase the amount of tobacco specified in the grower contracts.  PM USA also purchases a portion of its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants.  Nat Sherman purchases its tobacco requirements through leaf merchants.

USSTC purchases burley, dark fire-cured and air-cured tobaccos of various grades and styles from domestic tobacco growers under a contract growing program as well as from leaf merchants.

Middleton purchases burley, dark air-cured and flue-cured tobaccos of various grades and styles through leaf merchants.  Middleton does not have a contract growing program.

Altria Group, Inc.’s tobacco subsidiaries believe there is an adequate supply of tobacco in the world markets to satisfy their current and anticipated production requirements.  See Item 1A.  Risk Factors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Item 1A”) andTobacco Space - Business Environment - Price, Availability and Quality of Agricultural Productsin Item 7 for a discussion of risks associated with tobacco supply.

Wine

Ste. Michelle is a producer and supplier of premium varietal and blended table wines and of sparkling wines.  Ste. Michelle is a leading producer of Washington state wines, primarilyChateau Ste. Michelle,Columbia Crestand14 Hands,and owns wineries in or distributes wines from several other domestic and foreign wineregions.  Ste. Michelle’s total2016wine shipment volume of approximately9.3 millioncases increased5.3%from2015.



Ste. Michelleholds an 85% ownership interest in Michelle-Antinori, LLC, which ownsStag’s Leap Wine Cellarsin Napa Valley.  Ste. Michelle also ownsConn Creekin Napa Valley,Patz & Hallin Sonoma andErathin Oregon.  In addition, Ste. Michelle imports and marketsAntinori,TorresandVilla Maria Estatewines andChampagne Nicolas Feuillattein the United States.

▪Distribution, Competition and Raw Materials:Key elements of Ste. Michelle’s strategy are expanded domestic distribution of its wines, especially in certain account categories such as restaurants, wholesale clubs, supermarkets, wine shops and mass merchandisers, and a focus on improving product mix to higher-priced, premium products.

Ste. Michelle’s business is subject to significant competition, including competition from many larger, well-established domestic and international companies, as well as from many smaller wine producers.  Wine segment competition is primarily based on quality, price, consumer and trade wine tastings, competitive wine judging, third-party acclaim and advertising.  Substantially all of Ste. Michelle’s sales occur in the United States through state-licensed distributors.  Ste. Michelle also sells to domestic consumers through retail and e-commerce channels and exports wines to international distributors.

Federal, state and local governmental agencies regulate the beverage alcohol industry through various means, including licensing requirements, pricing rules, labeling and advertising restrictions, and distribution and production policies.  Further regulatory restrictions or additional excise or other taxes on the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages may have an adverse effect on Ste. Michelle’s wine business.

Ste. Michelle uses grapes harvested from its own vineyards or purchased from independent growers, as well as bulk wine purchased from other sources.  Grape production can be adversely affected by weather and other forces that may limit production.  At the present time, Ste. Michelle believes that there is a sufficient supply of grapes and bulk wine available in the market to satisfy its current and expected production requirements.  See Item 1A for a discussion of risks associated with competition, unfavorable changes in grape supply and governmental regulations.

However, no one patent or group of related patents was material to Altria Group, Inc.’s business or its tobacco businesses as ofDecember 31, 2016.

▪Environmental Regulation:Altria Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries (and former subsidiaries) are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise related to environmental protection, including, in the United States:  The Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “Superfund”), which can impose joint and several liability on each responsible party.

that subsidiaries of Altria Group, Inc. may undertake in the future.
