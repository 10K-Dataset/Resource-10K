Cash Flows - Investing Activities - Construction and Acquisition Expenditures” in MDA for discussion of anticipated construction and acquisition expenditures for 2011, 2012 and 2013.

3)  REGULATION -Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The following includes the primary
regulations impacting Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)- -

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005)- Alliant Energy is registered with FERC as a public utility holding
company, pursuant to PUHCA 2005, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain transactions involving its public utilities and other entities regulated by FERC. IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under PUHCA 2005 for
various issues including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, issuance of securities (IPL only) and books and records requirements.

Energy Policy Act- The Energy Policy Act requires creation of an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to provide oversight by FERC. FERC
designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the overarching ERO. The Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO), which is a regional member of NERC, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric reliability standards for
IPL and WPL.







Federal Power Act- FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over certain electric
utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale and transmission rates, dividend payments and accounting practices of IPL and WPL.

Electric Wholesale Rates- Corporate Services, as agent for both IPL and WPL, has received wholesale electric market-based rate authority from
FERC. Market-based rate authorization allows for wholesale sales of electricity within the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) and PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) markets and in bilateral markets, based on the market value of the
transactions.

Electric Transmission Rates- FERC regulates the rates charged for electric transmission facilities used in interstate
commerce. Neither IPL nor WPL own or operate electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon FERC-regulated rates. IPL relies primarily upon the use of the ITC
Midwest LLC (ITC) transmission system. WPL relies primarily upon the use of the ATC transmission system.

National Gas Act- FERC
regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and operations of IPL and WPL.

Environmental- The EPA administers certain federal regulatory programs and has delegated the administration of other environmental
regulatory programs to the applicable state environmental agencies. In general, the state agencies have jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances management and transportation, and solid waste management requirements. In certain
cases, the state environmental agencies have delegated the administration of environmental programs to local agencies. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to these environmental regulations as a result of their current and past operations.

IUB-IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB related to its operations in Iowa for various issues including, but not limited
to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements and approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities.

Retail Utility Base Rates -IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail rate relief. These filings are based on historical test periods. The historical test periods may be adjusted for
certain known and measurable capital additions placed in service by IPL within nine months from the end of the historical test period and certain known and measurable operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months of the
commencement of the proceeding. The IUB must decide on requests for retail rate relief within 10 months of the date of the application for which relief is filed, or the interim rates granted become permanent. Interim retail rates can be placed in
effect 10 days after the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on past precedent. Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for details of a retail electric base rate freeze effective for IPL’s Iowa customers through
2013.

Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -IPL’s retail electric and natural gas tariffs contain automatic adjustment
clauses for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs required to serve its retail customers in Iowa. Any over- or under-collection of commodity costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.

Retail Electric Transmission Cost Recovery Mechanism- Effective in the first quarter of 2011, electric transmission service expenses
will be removed from base rates and billed to IPL’s Iowa electric retail customers through a transmission cost rider approved by the IUB in January 2011. This new cost recovery mechanism will provide for subsequent adjustments to electric rates
charged to Iowa electric retail customers for changes in electric transmission service expenses.

Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Mechanism
- -IPL’s electric and natural gas tariffs contain an energy efficiency cost recovery (EECR) factor to recover prudently incurred energy efficiency costs incurred on behalf of IPL’s Iowa customers. EECR factors are revised annually,
subject to approval by the IUB, and include a reconciliation to eliminate any over- or under-recovery of energy efficiency expenses from prior periods.

New Electric Generating Facilities -A Certificate of Public Convenience, Use and Necessity (GCU Certificate) application is required to be filed with the IUB for construction approval of any new
electric generating facility located in Iowa with 25 MW or more of capacity.







Advance Rate Making Principles -Iowa Code §476.53 provides Iowa utilities with rate making
principles prior to making certain generation investments in Iowa. Under Iowa Code §476.53, IPL must file for, and the IUB must provide, rate making principles for electric generating facilities located in Iowa that have received construction
approval including new base-load (primarily defined as nuclear or coal-fired generation) facilities with a capacity of 300 MW or more, combined-cycle natural gas-fired facilities of any size and renewable generating resources, such as wind
facilities, of any size. Upon approval of rate making principles by the IUB, IPL must either build the facility under the approved rate making principles, or not at all.

PSCW-Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and amount of Alliant Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other affiliated interest activities,
among other issues. WPL is also subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of
proceeds of securities, approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities and certain other additions and extensions to facilities.

Retail Utility Base Rates -WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail rate relief. These filings are required to be based on forward-looking test periods. There is no statutory time
limit for the PSCW to decide retail rate requests. However, the PSCW attempts to process base retail rate cases in approximately 10 months and has the ability to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if necessary.

Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -

Electric- WPL’s retail electric base rates include estimates of annual fuel-related costs (fuel and purchased power energy costs) anticipated during the test period. During each electric
retail rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding, the PSCW sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to determine rates in such proceeding. If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall
outside these fuel monitoring ranges, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs from electric retail customers that are outside the approved ranges. Any over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs
for each year are reflected in future billings to retail customers. This cost recovery mechanism became effective for WPL on Jan. 1, 2011.

Natural Gas- WPL’s retail natural gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment clause for changes in prudently incurred natural gas
costs required to serve its retail gas customers. Any over- or under-collection of natural gas costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.

Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery Mechanism -WPL contributes a certain percentage of its annual retail utility revenues to help fund Focus on
Energy, Wisconsin’s statewide energy efficiency and renewable energy resource program. Contributions to Focus on Energy are recovered from WPL’s retail customers through changes in base rates determined during periodic rate proceedings and
include a reconciliation to eliminate any over- or under-recovery of contributions from prior periods.

New Electric Generating
Facilities- A Certificate of Authority application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new electric generating facility with a capacity of less than 100 MW. A Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity
application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new electric generating facility with a capacity of 100 MW or more. In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of electric generating facilities (including those
located outside the state of Wisconsin) to serve Wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.

Advance
Rate Making Principles- Wisconsin Statutes §196.371 provide Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to request rate making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or fossil-fueled electric generating facility or
renewable generating resource, such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers. WPL is not obligated to file for or accept authorized rate making principles under Wisconsin Statutes §196.371. WPL can proceed with an approved
project under traditional rate making terms.

MPUC- IPL is subject to regulation by the MPUC related to its operations in
Minnesota for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities that encumber property in Minnesota and approval of the location and
construction of electric generating facilities located in Minnesota with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.







Retail Utility Rates- Requests for retail rate relief can be based on either historical or projected
data and interim retail rates are permitted. IPL typically files requests for retail rate relief based on historical test periods. The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable capital additions placed in service by
IPL and operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months of the end of the test year. Unless otherwise ordered, the MPUC must reach a final decision within 10 months of filing for retail rate relief; however, the MPUC can extend
the timing by 90 days.

Refer to Notes 1(b), 1(h), 2 and 12(e) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” and
“Rate Matters,” “Environmental Matters” and “Legislative Matters” in MDA for additional information regarding regulation and utility rate matters.

4) STRATEGIC OVERVIEW -Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of various strategic actions by Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.

C. INFORMATION RELATING TO UTILITY OPERATIONS

Alliant Energy’s utility business (IPL and WPL) has three segments: a) electric operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes IPL’s steam operations, various other energy-related
products and services, and the unallocated portions of the utility business. In 2010, IPL’s and WPL’s operating revenues and operating income (loss) for these three utility business segments were as follows:

1) ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

General- Electric utility operations represent the largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL. Alliant
Energy’s electric utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL and WPL providing electric service in Iowa, southern and central Wisconsin and southern Minnesota. Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for
additional details regarding electric utility operations.

Jurisdictions- Electric utility revenues by state were as follows
(dollars in millions):

Customers- The number of electric customers and communities served at Dec. 31, 2010 was as
follows:



Retail CustomersWholesale CustomersOther CustomersTotal CustomersCommunities ServedIPL525,65791,357527,023752WPL454,776212,245457,042606980,433303,602984,0651,358

Wholesale customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale
service agreements. These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in tariffs approved by FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings. A significant majority of IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale service agreements have
terms that end after 2016.

In addition, IPL and WPL have bulk power customers, included in “Other customers” in the above table,
that are billed according to negotiated, long-term customer-specific contracts, pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs.

Seasonality-Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning requirements. In 2010, the maximum peak hour demands were as follows:



Alliant EnergyIPLWPLMW5,4252,9632,654DateAug. 11July 27Aug. 12

Competition-Retail electric customers in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota currently do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier. However, IPL and WPL attempt to attract new customers into their service territories in an effort to keep energy
rates low for all. Although electric service in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota is regulated, IPL and WPL still face competition from self-generation by large industrial customers, alternative energy sources, and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as
well as service territory expansions by municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin). Refer to “Rate Matters - Proposed Changes to Rate Recovery Mechanisms - Economic Development Program” for discussion of the PSCW’s approval
of an economic development program to attract and retain industrial customers in WPL’s service territory, which is currently being challenged by the Citizens Utility Board.

Renewable Energy Standards-

Iowa -Electric utilities in Iowa are required
to purchase or own their proportionate share of 105 MW of capacity and associated energy from alternate energy or small hydro facilities located in the utilities’ service area. IPL’s proportionate share is approximately 50 MW. As of Dec.
31, 2010, IPL had met the requirements of this renewable energy standard.

Wisconsin -A Wisconsin Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS)
was established in 2006 that requires electric utilities in Wisconsin, including WPL, to increase the portion of their total Wisconsin retail electric sales supplied by renewable energy sources above a benchmark of average retail sales from
renewables in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The RPS requires a 2% increase above the benchmark by 2010 and a 6% increase above the benchmark by 2015. Based on this RPS, WPL was required to supply a minimum of 6% of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales
with renewable energy sources by 2010 and will be required to increase this amount to 10% by 2015. Wisconsin utilities may reach the RPS with renewable energy







generated by the utility, acquired under purchased power agreements (PPAs), or through the use of renewable resource credits. As of Dec. 31, 2010, WPL had met the requirements of this renewable
energy standard for 2010.

Minnesota -A Minnesota Renewable Energy Standard (RES) was established in 2007 that requires electric
utilities operating in Minnesota, including IPL, to supply a minimum level of their total Minnesota retail electric sales with renewable energy sources by certain future dates. Based on this RES, IPL’s total Minnesota retail electric sales
supplied with renewable energy sources must be at least 12% by 2012; 17% by 2016; 20% by 2020; and 25% by 2025. Utilities in Minnesota may meet the requirements of the RES with renewable energy generated by the utility, renewable energy acquired
under PPAs or the use of renewable resource credits.

Refer to “Strategic Overview - Generation Plans” in MDA for discussion of
Alliant Energy’s generation plan, which includes additional supply from wind generation that contributed towards meeting renewable energy requirements discussed above.

Energy Conservation-IPL and WPL continue to promote energy conservation, including their customers’ ability to efficiently manage their energy use. Refer to “Strategic Overview -
Energy Efficiency Programs” in MDA for discussion of current energy efficiency programs at IPL and WPL.

Electric Supply

Electric Demand Planning Reserve Margin (PRM)- IPL and WPL are required to maintain a PRM above their projected annual peak demand forecast to
help ensure reliability of electric service to their customers. WPL is required to maintain a 14.5% PRM for long-term planning (planning years two through 10) and a PRM established by MISO for short-term planning. PRM requirements for IPL follow
MISO’s reserve requirements. IPL and WPL currently have adequate capacity to meet the MISO PRM requirements.

Generation -IPL and
WPL own a portfolio of electric generating facilities located in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal, natural gas and renewable resources. Refer to Item 2 Properties for details of IPL’s and WPL’s
electric generating stations.

Generating Capacity- The generating capacity of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating
facilities is based upon MISO’s resource adequacy process, which uses the unforced capacity of the generating facilities. The generating capacity for the June 2010 to May 2011 planning period by fuel type in MWs was as follows:



IPLWPLTotalCoal1,5421,2312,773Natural gas7155821,297Oil261--261Wind (a)--55Hydro--1717Total2,5181,8354,353







(a)Represents 0% and 8% of the capacity of wind projects owned by IPL and WPL, respectively, based upon the MISO resource adequacy process, which is determined separately
for each wind site, during the planning period from June 2010 to May 2011. As of Dec. 31, 2010, wind projects owned by Alliant Energy included IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa and WPL’s 68 MW
Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin. WPL’s 200 MW Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in Freeborn County, Minnesota was completed in early 2011 and was not included in the June 2010 to May 2011 MISO planning period.

Fuel Costs- The average cost of delivered fuel per million British Thermal Units used for electric generation
was as follows:



IPLWPL201020092008201020092008All fuels$2.17$2.29$2.09$2.17$2.13$2.06Coal1.731.561.582.062.021.93Natural gas (a)9.7913.318.1812.8318.538.64

(a)The average cost of natural gas is impacted by gains and losses from swap contracts used to hedge the price of natural gas volumes expected to be used by Alliant
Energy’s natural gas-fired electric generating facilities.

Coal- Coal is the primary fuel source for
Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s internally generated electric supply and generally represents approximately 50% to 55% of their total sources of electric energy. Alliant Energy, through Corporate Services as agent for IPL and WPL,
has entered into contracts with different suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired generating facilities for 2011 through 2013. As of Dec. 31, 2010, existing
contracts provide for a portfolio of coal supplies that cover approximately 78%, 17%, and 9% of Alliant Energy’s estimated coal supply needs for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe this portfolio of coal
supplies represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market changes. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL expect to meet remaining coal requirements from either
future contracts or purchases in the spot market. Alliant Energy, through its subsidiaries Corporate Services, IPL and WPL, also enters into various coal transportation agreements to meet its coal supply requirements. As of Dec. 31, 2010, existing
coal transportation agreements cover approximately 70%, 70%, 50% and 50% of Alliant Energy’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2011 through 2014, respectively.

The majority of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River Basin. A majority of this coal is transported by rail-car directly from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s generating
stations, with the remainder transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via barges to the final destination. As protection against interruptions in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory
supply targets of 25 to 50 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 30 to 150 days (depending upon the time of year) for generating stations with seasonal deliveries. Actual inventory averages for 2010 were 50 days for generating
stations with year-round deliveries and 138 days for generating stations with seasonal deliveries. The average days on hand were computed based on actual tons of inventory divided by estimated average daily tons burned in 2010. Alliant Energy, IPL
and WPL periodically test coal from sources other than the Wyoming Powder River Basin to determine which alternative sources of coal are most compatible with their generating stations. Access to alternative sources of coal is expected to provide
Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL with further protection against interruptions and lessen their dependence on their primary coal source.







Given their current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in their primary purchase region and
regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe they are reasonably insulated against coal price volatility. Alliant Energy’s coal procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms,
stair-stepped levels of supply going forward for multiple years and supplier diversity. Similarly, given the term lengths of its transportation agreements, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believes they are reasonably insulated against future higher coal
transportation rates from the major railroads.

Natural Gas- Alliant Energy owns several natural gas-fired generating facilities
including IPL’s 565 MW Emery Generating Station, WPL’s 300 MW Neenah Energy Facility and Resources’ 300 MW Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility. WPL has exclusive rights to the output of the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility under an
affiliated lease agreement. These facilities help meet customer demand for electricity generally during peak hour demands. Internally generated electric supply from natural gas-fired generating facilities generally represent less than 5% of Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy.

Alliant Energy has responsibility to supply natural gas to the
generating facilities it owns as well as Riverside, which WPL has rights to under a PPA. WPL has contracted with ANR Pipeline to provide firm pipeline transportation of 60,000 dekatherms (Dths) per day for Riverside and 2 million Dths of
storage capacity for WPL’s natural gas-fired generating facilities.

Nuclear- In 2006, IPL sold its interest in the Duane
Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) to a subsidiary of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NextEra) and upon closing of the sale entered into a PPA with NextEra to purchase energy and capacity from DAEC through February 2014. In 2005, WPL sold its interest in the
Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc. (Dominion) and upon closing of the sale entered into a long-term PPA with Dominion to purchase energy and capacity from Kewaunee through December 2013. As a result
of these transactions, Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL no longer have ownership interests in any nuclear generating facilities. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL entered into these transactions to reduce the financial and operational uncertainty associated
with nuclear generating facility ownership and operations while still retaining the benefit of the output from such nuclear generating facilities.

Wind- IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa began generating electricity in 2009. WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County,
Wisconsin began generating electricity in 2008. WPL’s 200 MW Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in Freeborn County, Minnesota began full generating electricity in early 2011. These wind projects are the first fully owned and operated wind
projects for IPL and WPL.

Purchased Power- IPL and WPL enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from wholesale energy markets to meet
a portion of their customer demand for electricity. Purchased power represented almost 45% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2010. IPL’s most significant PPA is with NextEra for the purchase
of energy and capacity from DAEC through February 2014. WPL’s most significant PPAs are with Dominion for the purchase of energy and capacity from Kewaunee through December 2013 and with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation for the purchase of
energy and capacity from Riverside through May 2013.

Refer to Note 1(h) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of electric
production fuel and purchased energy costs, Note 3(a) for details regarding PPAs accounted for as operating leases and Note 12(b) for details on IPL’s and WPL’s coal, natural gas and other purchased power commitments in the “Combined
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Electric Transmission-

IPL- IPL completed the sale of its electric transmission assets located in Iowa, Minnesota and Illinois to ITC in 2007. IPL sold its electric
transmission assets in order to monetize the value of the assets to help fund future capital expenditures, to capture tax benefits under federal tax policy that allowed deferral of gains on sales of qualifying electric transmission assets completed
prior to Jan. 1, 2008 (based on regulations at the time of the sale) and to promote regional transmission expansion that is expected to improve transmission reliability and access for its customers in Iowa and Minnesota. ITC is an independent
for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of the MISO RTO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities. ITC has transmission interconnections at various locations with other transmission owning utilities
in the Midwest. These interconnections enhance the overall reliability of the IPL delivery system and provide access to multiple sources of economic and emergency energy. IPL currently receives substantially all its transmission services from ITC.
The annual transmission service rates that ITC charge its customers is calculated each calendar year using a FERC-approved cost of service formula rate template referred to as Attachment “O.” Refer to “Other Matters - Other Future
Considerations - Electric Transmission Service Charges” in MDA for additional information







regarding transmission services charges from ITC. Refer to “Rate Matters - Recent Retail Base Rate Filings - IPL’s Iowa Retail Electric Rate Case (2009 Test Year)” for discussion
of a new transmission cost rider for recovery of electric transmission service expenses approved by the IUB in January 2011.

WPL- WPL
transferred its transmission assets to ATC in 2001 in exchange for an ownership interest in ATC. As of Dec. 31, 2010, WPL held a 16% ownership interest in ATC with a carrying value of $228 million. WPL currently anticipates making capital
contributions of $5 million, $5 million and $2 million to ATC in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively, to maintain its current ownership percentage. During 2010, ATC distributed to WPL, in the form of dividends, $31 million or approximately 80% of
WPL’s equity earnings from ATC. Although no assurance can be given, WPL anticipates ATC will continue this dividend payout ratio in the future. ATC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning member of
the MISO RTO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities. ATC has transmission interconnections with various other transmission owning utilities in the Midwest. These interconnections enhance the overall reliability of the WPL delivery
system and provide access to multiple sources of economic and emergency energy. WPL currently receives substantially all its transmission services from ATC. Refer to Note 20 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for
details of agreements between ATC and WPL.

MISO Markets- IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved RTO, which is
responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system in their service territories. IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy market and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which are discussed in more detail
below. IPL and WPL are parties to a system coordination and operating agreement whereby Corporate Services serves as agent on behalf of IPL and WPL. The agreement, which has been approved by FERC, provides a contractual basis for coordinated
planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the interconnected electric generation systems of IPL and WPL. As agent of the agreement, Corporate Services enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission service sale and
purchase transactions. Corporate Services allocates such sales and purchases among IPL and WPL based on procedures included in the agreement. The procedures were approved by FERC and all state regulatory bodies having jurisdiction. Refer to Note 20
of the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of these allocated amounts.

Wholesale Energy
Market -IPL and WPL began participation in the wholesale energy market operated by MISO in 2005. The market impacts the way IPL and WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain transmission services, schedule generation and ensure resource
adequacy to reliably serve load. In the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO evaluates IPL’s, WPL’s and other market participants’ offers, bids and
energy injections into, and withdrawals from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly basis. MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on locational marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the
specific time and location of the purchase and/or sale of energy. The market is intended to send price signals to stakeholders where generation or transmission system expansion is needed. This market-based approach is expected to result in lower
overall costs in areas with abundant transmission capacity. In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support reliability needs, but that would not have operated based on economic needs. In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these
generators are made whole financially for their variable costs. IPL and WPL also periodically engage in related transactions in PJM’s bid/offer-based wholesale energy market, which are accounted for similar to the MISO transactions.

Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) and Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs)- In areas of constrained transmission capacity, such as Wisconsin, costs
could be higher due to congestion and their impact on locational marginal prices. As part of the MISO market restructuring in 2005, physical transmission rights of IPL and WPL were replaced with FTRs. FTRs provide a hedge for congestion costs that
occur in the MISO day-ahead energy market. Both IPL and WPL are allocated ARRs from MISO each year based on historical use of the transmission system. The revenue rights associated with these ARRs are used by IPL and WPL to acquire FTRs through the
FTR auctions operated by MISO. IPL’s and WPL’s current FTRs acquired from ARRs extend through May 31, 2011. MISO re-allocates ARRs annually based on a fiscal year from June 1 through May 31. Based on the FTRs awarded to IPL
and WPL to-date and future expected allocations of ARRs, along with the expected regulatory recovery treatment of MISO costs, the financial impacts associated with FTRs have not differed significantly from the financial impacts associated with
physical transmission rights that existed prior to the MISO wholesale energy market.

Ancillary Services Market- In 2009, MISO
launched an ancillary services market, which integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency reserves with the existing wholesale energy market implemented in 2005. Regulation refers to the moment-to-moment changes in generation
that are necessary to meet changes in electricity demand. Contingency reserves refer to additional generation or demand response resources, either on-line or that can be brought on-







line within 10 minutes, to meet certain major events such as the loss of a large generating unit or transmission line. MISO plans to address refinements to its ancillary services market in 2011.

MISO and PJM Market Flow Corrections- In 2009, MISO and PJM disclosed an error in the calculation of market flow data between the two
independent system operators that began in 2005. The error resulted in incorrect payments between MISO and PJM during 2005 through 2009. Because IPL and WPL participated in both the MISO and PJM markets during the period of the error, IPL and WPL
may have been entitled to refunds or may have been required to make additional payments to the two independent system operators. In 2010, MISO and PJM filed complaints against each other with FERC. In January 2011, MISO and PJM filed a settlement,
which is pending final FERC approval. Under the proposed settlement, payments would not be exchanged between MISO and PJM. Instead, process changes would be established, including a baseline review of market-to-market processes and accounting,
establishment of a change management process regarding the same biennial review of process changes, and enhanced access to pertinent data enabling independent verification of calculations related to settlements. Future market-to-market billing
adjustment claims would be limited to one year before the error is discovered compared to the current two-year limitation.

2) GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

General- Gas utility operations represent the second largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL. Alliant Energy’s gas
utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL and WPL providing gas service in Iowa, southern and central Wisconsin and southern Minnesota. Refer to the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding gas
utility operations.

Jurisdictions-Gas utility revenues by state were as follows (dollars in millions):



201020092008AmountPercentAmountPercentAmountPercentIPL:Iowa$261.554%$295.256%$390.455%Minnesota12.83%13.63%20.03%Subtotal274.357%308.859%410.458%WPL:Wisconsin206.343%216.541%300.042%$480.6100%$525.3100%$710.4100%

Customers-The number of gas customers and communities
served at Dec. 31, 2010 were as follows:



RetailTransportation /TotalCommunitiesCustomersOther CustomersCustomersServedIPL233,792249234,041243WPL178,570226178,796237412,362475412,837480

IPL’s and WPL’s retail customers in the above table are
billed under base rates established by the IUB, MPUC or PSCW that include a return on investments in gas infrastructure and recovery of costs required to serve customers. Commodity, storage and transportation costs incurred by IPL and WPL are
recovered pursuant to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms. In addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving customer-owned gas through Alliant
Energy’s distribution systems to the customers’ meters. Revenues are collected for this service pursuant to transportation tariffs.

Seasonality-Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter
season. Natural gas obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements. Storage contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer, store the gas in underground
storage fields and deliver it in the winter.

Competition- Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring more
competition to the gas industry. While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are subject to competition from third parties. It remains uncertain if,
and when, the current economic disincentives for smaller consumption customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that the utility business begins to face competition for the sale of gas to those customers.

Gas Supply- IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 60 suppliers of natural gas from various gas producing regions
of the U.S. and Canada. The majority of the gas supply contracts are for terms of six months or less, with the remaining supply contracts having terms through March 2013. IPL’s and WPL’s gas supply commitments are primarily market-based.

In providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage
contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL. Transportation contracts with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG), ANR Pipeline (ANR), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America (NGPL), Northern Border Pipeline (NBPL) and Guardian Pipeline (Guardian) allow access to
gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada. Arrangements with Firm Citygate Supplies (FCS) provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its service territory. In 2010, the maximum daily delivery capacity for IPL and WPL was as follows (in Dths):







NNGANRNGPLFCSNBPLGuardianTotalIPL191,96953,18042,61815,00014,085--316,852WPL76,056167,467------10,000253,523

FERC
Investigation of Pipeline Tariffs- In 2009, FERC initiated proceedings to investigate the rates of return that NNG, Great Lakes Pipeline and NGPL earned in 2008. FERC used data from annual filings made by interstate pipelines to estimate the
rate of return that all U.S. pipelines earned in 2008 and concluded that these three pipelines may have earned rates of return exceeding 20%. In 2010, settlements were reached in all three FERC investigations, resulting in no impact to WPL and an
immaterial impact to IPL that was passed on to its customers through IPL’s natural gas cost recovery mechanism.

Refer to Note 1(h) for
information relating to utility natural gas cost recovery mechanisms and Note 12(b) for discussion of natural gas commitments in the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

(a)In February 2007, IPL and WPL sold their respective natural gas properties in Illinois. At the date of the sale, IPL and WPL had approximately 6,000 and 8,000 gas
retail customers in Illinois, respectively. Prior to the asset sales, the gas sales to retail customers in Illinois are included in residential, commercial and industrial sales in the tables above.

(b)Heating degree days are calculated using a simple average of the high and low temperatures each day compared to a 65 degree base. Normal degree days are calculated
using a rolling 20-year average of historical heating degree days.







3) STEAM UTILITY OPERATIONS -IPL has historically provided steam service
to approximately 200 customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who used high-pressure steam for production purposes or low-pressure steam for hot water and heat. Substantially all of the steam for these customers was generated by IPL’s Prairie Creek
Generating Station (Prairie Creek) and Sixth Street Generating Station (Sixth Street) in Cedar Rapids prior to June 2008. In June 2008, Prairie Creek and Sixth Street were shutdown as a result of significant damage caused by severe flooding in
downtown Cedar Rapids. Soon after the flood waters receded, IPL made necessary repairs to its steam distribution systems and established temporary steam generating systems (natural gas-fired package boilers and water treatment systems) to resume
steam service for its customers. Following months of evaluations and discussions with its steam customers, IPL announced in 2009 its decision to discontinue providing temporary steam service to those steam customers located in downtown Cedar Rapids
previously served by Sixth Street. IPL ceased low-pressure steam operations in downtown Cedar Rapids in December 2009 and high-pressure steam operations in downtown Cedar Rapids in the second quarter of 2010. Prairie Creek was returned to service in
2009 and is expected to be the primary source of steam for IPL’s remaining two high-pressure steam customers in the future.

D. INFORMATION RELATING TO NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS

Resourcesmanages a portfolio of wholly-owned subsidiaries and additional
investments through several distinct platforms: Transportation, RMT, Non-regulated Generation and other non-regulated investments.

Transportation -includes a short-line railway that provides freight service between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; a barge terminal and
hauling services on the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services.

RMT -provides renewable energy services, and
environmental consulting and engineering services to clients throughout the U.S. RMT offers facility siting, permitting, design, construction and high voltage connection services for wind and solar projects in the U.S. RMT’s environmental
consulting and engineering services include site remediation, restoration and construction management, air quality control, and auditing/compliance management.

Renewable energy services- Recent economic conditions have constrained financial markets and lowered funding for large capital projects in the renewable energy services market. With fewer
renewable energy projects receiving funding, the competition for those projects has intensified and profit margins have been negatively impacted. RMT is currently among a small group of companies that has technical expertise and project experience
for all phases of a renewable energy project, from siting through electrical grid connection. At Dec. 31, 2010, RMT had executed contracts for 6 wind projects and 1 solar project that were either under construction or expected to begin construction
in 2011. Future growth in the renewable energy infrastructure market may attract new competitors to the renewable energy services market including large construction companies.

Environmental consulting and engineering services- The environmental consulting and engineering services market is mature, highly fragmented, and composed of a large number of firms ranging in
size from small private entities to large public firms. Merger and acquisition activity continues, resulting in increased consolidation. RMT’s competitors in this market vary by their scope of services, scale and geographical location of
projects.

Non-regulated Generation- owns the 300 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility near Sheboygan
Falls, Wisconsin, which is leased to WPL for an initial period of 20 years ending in 2025.

Other non-regulated investments -include the Whiting Petroleum Corporation tax sharing agreement receivable discussed in Note 4(b) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” real estate investments, two corporate airplanes and several other modest
investments.
