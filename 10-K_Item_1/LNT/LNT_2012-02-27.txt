ITEM 1.BUSINESS

A. GENERAL

Alliant Energy was incorporated in Wisconsin in 1981 and maintains its principal executive offices in Madison, Wisconsin. Alliant
Energy operates as a regulated investor-owned public utility holding company. Alliant Energy’s primary focus is to provide regulated electricity and natural gas service to approximately 1 million electric and approximately 414,000 natural
gas customers in the Midwest through its two public utility subsidiaries. The primary first tier subsidiaries of Alliant Energy are: IPL, WPL, Resources and Corporate Services. An illustration of Alliant Energy’s first tier subsidiaries is
shown below.





A brief description of the primary first tier subsidiaries of Alliant Energy is as follows:

1) IPL- was incorporated in 1925 in Iowa as Iowa Railway and Light Corporation. IPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and
distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in Iowa and southern Minnesota. In Iowa, IPL provides utility services to incorporated communities as directed by the Iowa Utilities Board (IUB)
and utilizes non-exclusive franchises, which cover the use of public right-of-ways for utility facilities in incorporated communities for a maximum term of 25 years. At Dec. 31, 2011, IPL supplied electric and gas service to 525,770 and 233,715
retail customers, respectively. IPL is also engaged in the generation and distribution of steam for two customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. In 2011, 2010 and 2009, IPL had no single customer for which electric, gas, steam and/or other sales accounted
for 10% or more of IPL’s consolidated revenues.

2) WPL- was incorporated in 1917 in Wisconsin as Eastern Wisconsin Electric
Company. WPL is a public utility engaged principally in the generation and distribution of electricity and the distribution and transportation of natural gas in selective markets in southern and central Wisconsin. WPL operates in municipalities
pursuant to permits of indefinite duration and state statutes authorizing utility operation in areas annexed by a municipality. At Dec. 31, 2011, WPL supplied electric and gas service to 456,637 and 179,945 retail customers, respectively. In 2011,
2010 and 2009, WPL had no single customer for which electric, gas and/or other sales accounted for 10% or more of WPL’s consolidated revenues. WPL Transco LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPL and holds WPL’s investment in the American
Transmission Company LLC (ATC).

3) RESOURCES- was incorporated in 1988 in Wisconsin. In 2008, Resources was converted to a limited
liability company. Alliant Energy’s non-regulated investments are organized under Resources. Refer to “D. Information Relating to Non-regulated Operations” for additional details.

3) REGULATION -Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. The following includes the primary regulations impacting
Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.

Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005)- Alliant Energy is registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to
PUHCA 2005, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain transactions involving its public utilities, service company and other entities regulated by FERC. Corporate Services, IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under
PUHCA 2005 for various matters including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, and books and records requirements.

Energy Policy Act- The Energy Policy Act requires creation of an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO) to provide oversight by FERC. FERC designated the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation (NERC) as the overarching ERO. The Midwest Reliability Organization (MRO), which is a regional member of NERC, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric reliability standards for IPL and WPL.

Federal Power Act- FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric
wholesale and transmission rates, dividend payments, issuance of securities (IPL and Corporate Services only) and accounting practices of Corporate Services, IPL and WPL.

Electric Wholesale Rates- Corporate Services, as agent for both IPL and WPL, has received wholesale electric market-based rate authority from FERC. Market-based rate authorization allows for
wholesale sales of electricity within the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO) and PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) markets and in bilateral markets, based on the market value of the transactions. IPL and WPL also have FERC-approved
cost-of-service based rates related to the provision of firm full- and partial-requirement wholesale electric sales. Both IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale cost-of-service tariffs are formula-based tariffs that allow for annual true-ups to actual
costs, including fuel costs.

Electric Transmission Rates- FERC regulates the rates charged for electric transmission facilities used
in interstate commerce. Neither IPL nor WPL own or operate electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon FERC-regulated rates. IPL relies primarily upon the use
of the ITC Midwest LLC (ITC) transmission system. WPL relies primarily upon the use of the ATC transmission system.

National Gas Act-
FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act. Under the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and operations of IPL and WPL.







As part of routine procedures, in the fourth quarter of 2011, FERC commenced an audit of Alliant Energy,
including its centralized service company (Corporate Services) and other affiliated companies. A final report is expected to be issued by FERC in late 2012 or early 2013. Alliant Energy does not believe that the final report will have any impact
upon its financial condition or results of operations.

Environmental-Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to extensive
environmental requirements. The EPA administers certain federal regulatory programs and has delegated the administration of other environmental regulatory programs to the applicable state environmental agencies. In general, the state agencies have
jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances management, transportation and clean-up, and solid waste management requirements. In certain cases, the state environmental agencies have delegated the administration of environmental
programs to local agencies. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to these environmental regulations as a result of their current and past operations.

IUB-IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB related to its operations in Iowa for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting
requirements and approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities. As part of the IUB’s February 2011 order related to IPL’s Iowa retail electric rate case (2009 test year), the IUB outlined plans for IPL’s
management activities to be audited by a third party vendor. This audit commenced in the third quarter of 2011. A final report is expected to be issued by the third party vendor to the IUB in the second half of 2012. Alliant Energy and IPL do not
currently believe that the final report will have any impact upon their financial condition or results of operations.

Retail Utility Base
Rates -IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail rate relief. These filings are based on historical test periods. The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable capital additions placed in service by IPL
within nine months from the end of the historical test period and certain known and measurable operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months of the commencement of the proceeding. Interim retail rates can be placed in effect 10
days after the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on past precedent. The IUB must decide on requests for retail rate relief within 10 months of the date of the application for which relief is filed, or the interim rates
granted become permanent. Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for details of a retail electric base rate freeze effective for IPL’s Iowa customers through 2013.

Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -IPL’s retail electric and natural gas tariffs contain automatic adjustment clauses for changes in prudently incurred commodity costs required to
serve its retail customers in Iowa. Any over- or under-collection of commodity costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.

Retail Electric Transmission Cost Recovery Mechanism- Effective February 2011, electric transmission service expenses were removed from base rates and billed to IPL’s Iowa retail electric
customers through the transmission cost rider. This new cost recovery mechanism provides for subsequent adjustments to electric rates charged to Iowa retail electric customers for changes in electric transmission service expenses. Any over- or
under-collection of electric transmission costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers. The transmission cost rider will remain in effect until the IUB’s decision in IPL’s next retail
electric base rate case, whereby the rider will be revisited.

Energy Efficiency Cost Recovery (EECR) Mechanism -IPL’s electric
and natural gas tariffs contain an EECR factor to recover prudently incurred energy efficiency costs incurred on behalf of IPL’s Iowa customers. EECR factors are revised annually, subject to approval by the IUB, and include a reconciliation to
eliminate any over- or under-recovery of energy efficiency expenses from prior periods.

New Electric Generating Facilities -A
Certificate of Public Convenience, Use and Necessity (GCU Certificate) application is required to be filed with the IUB for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in Iowa with 25 MW or more of capacity.

Advance Rate Making Principles -Iowa Code §476.53 provides Iowa utilities with rate making principles prior to making certain generation
investments in Iowa. Under Iowa Code §476.53, IPL must file for, and the IUB must render a decision on, rate making principles for electric generating facilities located in Iowa including new base-load (primarily defined as nuclear or
coal-fired generation) facilities with a capacity of 300 MW or more, combined-cycle natural gas-fired facilities of any size and renewable generating resources, such as wind facilities, of any size. Upon approval of rate making principles by the
IUB, IPL must either build the facility under the approved rate making principles, or not at all.







Electric Generating Facility Emission Control Projects- IPL is required to submit an Emissions Plan
and Budget biennially to the IUB setting out a multi-year plan and budget for managing regulated emissions from its electric generating facilities in a cost-effective manner. IPL must simultaneously submit this plan and budget to the Iowa Department
of Natural Resources for a determination of whether the plan and budget meets state environmental requirements for regulated emissions. The reasonable costs associated with implementing the plan are expected to be included in IPL’s future
retail electric rates.

PSCW-Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and amount of Alliant
Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other affiliated interest activities, among other matters. WPL is also subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for various matters including, but not limited
to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities, affiliate transactions, approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities and certain other additions
and extensions to facilities.

Retail Utility Base Rates -WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail rate relief. These
filings are required to be based on forward-looking test periods. There is no statutory time limit for the PSCW to decide retail rate requests. However, the PSCW attempts to process base retail rate cases in approximately 10 months and has the
ability to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if necessary.

Retail Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -

Electric- WPL’s retail electric base rates include estimates of annual fuel-related costs (fuel and purchased power energy
costs) anticipated during the test period. During each electric retail rate proceeding or in a separate fuel cost plan approval proceeding, the PSCW sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to determine rates in
such proceeding. If WPL’s actual fuel-related costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, WPL is authorized to defer the incremental over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs from electric retail customers that are outside the
approved ranges. Deferral of under-collections are reduced to the extent actual return on common equity earned by WPL during the fuel cost plan year exceeds the most recently authorized return on common equity. Subject to review and approval by the
PSCW, any over- or under-collection of fuel-related costs for each year are reflected in future billings to retail customers. This cost recovery mechanism became effective for WPL on Jan. 1, 2011.

Natural Gas- WPL’s retail natural gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment clause for changes in prudently incurred natural gas
costs required to serve its retail gas customers. Any over- or under-collection of natural gas costs for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail customers.

EECR Mechanism -WPL contributes a certain percentage of its annual retail utility revenues to help fund Focus on Energy, Wisconsin’s
statewide energy efficiency and renewable energy resource program. Estimated contributions to Focus on Energy, along with WPL-run energy efficiency program costs, are recovered from WPL’s retail customers through changes in base rates
determined during periodic rate proceedings and include a reconciliation of such estimated amounts to actual costs incurred with any difference deferred for inclusion in future base rate changes.

New Electric Generating Facilities -A Certificate of Authority (CA) application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval
of any new electric generating facility with a capacity of less than 100 MW. A Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of any new electric generating facility with a
capacity of 100 MW or more built in Wisconsin. In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of electric generating facilities (including those located outside the state of Wisconsin) to serve Wisconsin customers is subject to retail utility rate
regulation by the PSCW.

Electric Generating Facility Upgrades -A CA application is required to be filed with the PSCW for
construction approval of any additions to electric generating facilities, including emission control projects that exceed a certain threshold amount. The current PSCW rules require a CA for projects with an estimated cost in excess of approximately
$8 million.

Advance Rate Making Principles -Wisconsin Statute §196.371 provides Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to
request rate making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or fossil-fueled electric generating facility or renewable generating resource, such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers. WPL is not obligated
to file for or accept authorized rate making principles under Wisconsin Statute §196.371. WPL can proceed with an approved project under traditional rate making terms or accept authorized rate making principles under Wisconsin Statute
§196.371.

Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC)- IPL is subject to regulation by the MPUC related to its
operations in Minnesota for various matters including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities that encumber property in Minnesota, affiliate
transactions, and approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities located in Minnesota with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.







Retail Utility Rates- Requests for retail rate relief can be based on either historical or projected
data and interim retail rates are permitted. IPL typically files requests for retail rate relief based on historical test periods. The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain known and measurable capital additions placed in service by
IPL and operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months of the end of the test year. Unless otherwise ordered, the MPUC must reach a final decision within 10 months of filing for retail rate relief; however, the MPUC can extend
the timing by 90 days.

Renewable Energy Cost Recovery Mechanism -In November 2011, IPL received an order from the MPUC approving the
implementation of an automatic cost recovery rider on a temporary basis to recover costs associated with renewable generation. The renewable energy rider does not require a base rate case for annual revision of rates charged to IPL’s Minnesota
retail electric customers, but requires that the renewable energy costs incurred be fully reconciled against the revenues collected for such costs. Initially, this would allow recovery of IPL’s Whispering Willow - East wind project located in
Iowa. In November 2011, the MPUC deferred judgment on the prudence of the Whispering Willow - East wind project costs. The initial recovery amount of the project costs will be allowed through the temporary renewable energy rider at a levelized cost
of $51 per megawatt-hour (MWh). The final recovery amount of the project costs will be addressed in a separate proceeding that is expected to be completed in 2012.

Refer to Notes 1(b), 1(h), 2 and 13(d) of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” and “Rate Matters,” “Environmental Matters” and “Legislative
Matters” in MDA for additional information regarding regulation and utility rate matters.

1) ELECTRIC UTILITY OPERATIONS

General- Electric utility operations represent the largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL. Alliant Energy’s electric utility operations are located in the Midwest
with IPL providing electric service in Iowa and southern Minnesota and WPL providing electric service in southern and central Wisconsin. Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding electric utility
operations.

Jurisdictions- Electric utility revenues by state were as follows (dollars in millions):

Wholesale
customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale service agreements. These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms that are detailed in tariffs approved by
FERC through wholesale rate case proceedings. The tariffs include an annual true-up process for actual costs incurred. A significant majority of IPL’s and WPL’s wholesale service agreements have terms that end after 2017.

In addition, IPL and WPL have bulk power customers, included in “Other customers” in the above table, that are billed according to negotiated,
long-term customer-specific contracts, pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs.

Seasonality-Electric sales are seasonal to some
extent with the annual peak normally occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning requirements. In 2011, the maximum peak hour demands were as follows:



Alliant EnergyIPLWPLMW5,7343,1312,761DateJuly 18Aug. 2July 20

Competition-Retail electric customers in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota currently do not have the ability
to choose their electric supplier. However, IPL and WPL attempt to attract new customers into their service territories in an effort to keep energy rates low for all. Although electric service in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota is regulated, IPL and
WPL still face competition from self-generation by large industrial customers, alternative energy sources, and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin). Refer to
“Rate Matters - Other - Economic Development Program” in MDA for discussion of the PSCW’s approval of an economic development program to attract and retain industrial customers in WPL’s service territory.







Renewable Energy Standards (RES)-

Iowa -Electric utilities in Iowa are required to purchase or own their proportionate share of 105 MW of capacity and associated energy from alternate energy or small hydro facilities located in
the utilities’ service area. IPL’s proportionate share is approximately 50 MW. As of Dec. 31, 2011, IPL had met the requirements of this renewable energy standard.

Wisconsin -A Wisconsin Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was established in 2006 that requires electric utilities in Wisconsin, including WPL, to increase the portion of their total Wisconsin
retail electric sales supplied by renewable energy sources above a benchmark of average retail sales from renewables in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The RPS required a 2% increase above the benchmark by 2010 and will require a 6% increase above the
benchmark by 2015. Based on this RPS, WPL was required to supply a minimum of 5.28% of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales with renewable energy sources by 2010 and will be required to increase this amount to 9.28% by 2015. Wisconsin utilities
may reach the RPS with renewable energy generated by the utility, acquired under purchased power agreements (PPAs), or through the use of renewable resource credits. WPL has met the 2010 requirements of this renewable energy standard and currently
expects to meet the 2015 requirements of the RPS with its current wind generation and wind PPAs.

Minnesota -A Minnesota RES was
established in 2007 that requires electric utilities operating in Minnesota, including IPL, to supply a minimum level of their total Minnesota retail electric sales with renewable energy sources by certain future dates. Based on this RES, IPL’s
total Minnesota retail electric sales supplied with renewable energy sources must be at least 12% by 2012; 17% by 2016; 20% by 2020; and 25% by 2025. Utilities in Minnesota may meet the requirements of the RES with renewable energy generated by the
utility, renewable energy acquired under PPAs or the use of renewable energy credits. IPL currently expects to satisfy the 2012 requirements of the RES with its current wind generation and wind PPAs, and supplemented as needed with renewable energy
credits.

Energy Conservation-IPL and WPL continue to promote energy conservation, including their customers’ ability to
efficiently manage their energy use. Refer to “Strategic Overview - Energy Efficiency Programs” in MDA for discussion of current energy efficiency programs at IPL and WPL.

Electric Supply

Electric Demand Planning Reserve Margin (PRM)- IPL and WPL are required to maintain a PRM
above their projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure reliability of electric service to their customers. WPL is required to maintain a 14.5% PRM for long-term planning (planning years two through 10) and a PRM established by MISO for
short-term planning. PRM requirements for IPL follow MISO’s reserve requirements. IPL and WPL currently have adequate capacity to meet the MISO PRM requirements.

Generation -IPL and WPL own a portfolio of electric generating facilities located in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal, natural gas and renewable resources.
Refer to Item 2 Properties for details of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating stations.







Generating Capacity- The generating capacity of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating
facilities is based upon MISO’s resource adequacy process, which uses the unforced capacity of the generating facilities. The generating capacity for the June 2011 to May 2012 planning period by fuel type in MWs was as follows:



IPLWPLTotalCoal1,3921,3322,724Natural gas7796131,392Oil277—277Wind (a)—66Hydro—2424Total2,4481,9754,423



(a)As of Dec. 31, 2011, completed wind projects owned by Alliant Energy included IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa,
WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin and WPL’s 200 MW Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in Freeborn County, Minnesota. The amounts in the table above represent 0%, 9% and 0% of the capacity of IPL’s
Whispering Willow - East, WPL’s Cedar Ridge and WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I wind projects, respectively, based upon the MISO resource adequacy process, which is determined separately for each wind site, during the planning period from June
2011 to May 2012.

Fuel Costs- The average cost of delivered fuel per million British Thermal Units used for electric
generation was as follows:



IPLWPL201120102009201120102009All fuels$2.18$2.17$2.29$2.28$2.17$2.13Coal1.861.731.562.222.062.02Natural gas (a)7.179.7913.316.3012.8318.53



(a)The average cost of natural gas includes commodity costs as well as gains and losses from swap contracts used to hedge the price of natural gas volumes expected to be
used by Alliant Energy’s natural gas-fired electric generating facilities.

Coal- Coal is the primary fuel
source for Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s internally generated electric supply and generally represents approximately 50% to 55% of their total sources of electric energy. Alliant Energy, through Corporate Services as agent for IPL
and WPL, has entered into contracts with different suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired generating facilities for 2012 and 2013. As of Dec. 31, 2011, existing
contracts provide for a portfolio of coal supplies that cover approximately 80% and 50% of IPL’s and WPL’s estimated coal supply needs for 2012 and 2013, respectively. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL believe this portfolio of coal supplies
represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market changes. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL expect to meet remaining coal requirements from either future
contracts or purchases in the spot market. Alliant Energy, through its subsidiaries Corporate Services, IPL and WPL, also enters into various coal transportation agreements to meet its coal supply requirements. As of Dec. 31, 2011, existing coal
transportation agreements cover approximately 100%, 50%, 50% and 15% of IPL’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2012 through 2015, respectively, and 100%, 100%, 100% and 30% of WPL’s estimated coal transportation needs for 2012
through 2015, respectively.

Nearly all of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River Basin. A majority of this coal is
transported by rail-car directly from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s generating stations, with the remainder transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via barges to the final destination. As protection against
interruptions in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory supply targets of 25 to 50 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 30 to 150 days (depending upon the time of year) for generating stations
with seasonal deliveries. Actual inventory averages for 2011 were 43 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 103 days for generating stations with seasonal deliveries. The average days on hand were computed based on actual tons
of inventory divided by estimated average daily tons burned in 2011. Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL periodically test coal from sources other than the Wyoming Powder River Basin to determine which alternative sources of coal are most compatible with
their generating stations. Access to alternative sources of coal is expected to provide Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL with further protection against interruptions and lessen their dependence on their primary coal source.







Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL
believe they are reasonably insulated against coal price volatility given their current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in their primary purchase region and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms. Alliant Energy’s coal
procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms, stair-stepped levels of supply going forward for multiple years and supplier diversity. Similarly, given the term lengths of its transportation agreements, Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL believes they are reasonably insulated against future higher coal transportation rates from the major railroads.

Natural Gas- Alliant Energy owns several natural gas-fired generating facilities including IPL’s 565 MW Emery Generating Station, WPL’s
300 MW Neenah Energy Facility and Resources’ 300 MW Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility. WPL has exclusive rights to the output of the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility under an affiliated lease agreement. These facilities help meet customer demand
for electricity generally during peak hour demands. Internally generated electric supply from natural gas-fired generating facilities generally represents less than 5% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric
energy.

Alliant Energy has responsibility to supply natural gas to the generating facilities it owns as well as Riverside, which WPL has
rights to under a PPA. WPL has contracted with ANR Pipeline (ANR) to provide firm pipeline transportation of 60,000 dekatherms (Dths) per day for Riverside and 2 million Dths of storage capacity for WPL’s natural gas-fired generating
facilities.

Wind- IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa began generating electricity in
2009. WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin began generating electricity in 2008. WPL’s 200 MW Bent Tree - Phase I wind project in Freeborn County, Minnesota began full generation of electricity in early
2011. Internally generated electric supply from wind facilities generally represents less than 5% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy. All or some of the renewable energy attributes associated with
generation from these sources may be used in future years to comply with renewable energy standards or other regulatory requirements, or sold to third parties in the form of renewable energy credits or other environmental commodities.

Purchased Power- IPL and WPL enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from wholesale energy markets to meet a portion of their customer demand
for electricity. Purchased power represented approximately 40% to 45% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in 2011. IPL’s most significant PPA is with NextEra Energy, Inc. for the purchase of
energy and capacity from the Duane Arnold Energy Center (DAEC) through February 2014. IPL currently believes it is unlikely that it will enter into any long-term agreement with NextEra Energy, Inc. for the purchase of electricity generated by DAEC
beyond the current DAEC PPA term. WPL’s most significant PPAs are with Dominion Resources, Inc. for the purchase of energy and capacity from the Kewaunee Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) through December 2013 and with a subsidiary of Calpine
Corporation for the purchase of energy and capacity from Riverside through May 2013. WPL currently believes it is unlikely that it will enter into any long-term agreement with Dominion Resources, Inc. for the purchase of electricity generated by
Kewaunee beyond the current Kewaunee PPA term. WPL currently anticipates it will acquire Riverside in late 2012 to replace the electricity output currently obtained from Riverside beyond the current Riverside PPA term.







Refer to Note 1(h) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of electric production fuel and
purchased energy costs, Note 3(a) for details regarding PPAs accounted for as operating leases and Note 13(a) for details on IPL’s and WPL’s coal, natural gas and other purchased power commitments in the “Combined Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.”

Electric Transmission-

IPL

WPL- WPL
transferred its transmission assets to ATC in 2001 in exchange for an ownership interest in ATC. As of Dec. 31, 2011, WPL held a 16% ownership interest in ATC with a carrying value of $239 million. WPL currently anticipates making capital
contributions of $7 million, $4 million and $2 million to ATC in 2012, 2013 and 2014, respectively, to maintain its current ownership percentage. During 2011, ATC distributed to WPL, in the form of dividends, $31 million or approximately 82% of
WPL’s equity earnings from ATC. Although no assurance can be given, WPL anticipates ATC will continue a dividend payout ratio close to this level in the future. ATC is an independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a
transmission-owning member of the MISO RTO, MRO and Reliability First Corporation Regional Entities. ATC has transmission interconnections with various other transmission owning utilities in the Midwest. These interconnections enhance the overall
reliability of the WPL delivery system and provide access to multiple sources of economic and emergency energy. WPL currently receives substantially all its transmission services from ATC. Refer to Note 21 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements” for details of agreements between ATC and WPL.

MISO Markets- IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a
FERC-approved RTO, which is responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system in their service territories. IPL and WPL participate in the wholesale energy and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which are
discussed in more detail below. IPL and WPL are parties to a system coordination and operating agreement whereby Corporate Services serves as agent on behalf of IPL and WPL. The agreement, which has been approved or reviewed by FERC and all state
regulatory bodies having jurisdiction, provides a contractual basis for coordinated planning, construction, operation and maintenance of the interconnected electric generation systems of IPL and WPL. As agent of the agreement, Corporate Services
enters into energy, capacity, ancillary services, and transmission service sale and purchase transactions. Corporate Services allocates such sales and purchases among IPL and WPL based on information provided by MISO and procedures included in the
agreement. Refer to Note 21 of the “Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional discussion of these allocated amounts.

Wholesale Energy Market -IPL and WPL began participation in the wholesale energy market operated by MISO in 2005. The market impacts the way IPL and WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain
transmission services, schedule generation and ensure resource adequacy to reliably serve load. In the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for energy at locations across the MISO region. MISO evaluates IPL’s,
WPL’s and other market participants’ offers, bids and energy injections into, and withdrawals from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly basis. MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on
locational marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the specific time and location of the purchase and/or sale of energy. The market is intended to send price signals to stakeholders about where generation or transmission system
expansion is needed. This market-based approach is expected to result in lower overall costs in areas with abundant transmission capacity. In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support reliability needs, but that would not have operated
based on economic needs. In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these generators are made whole financially for their variable costs. IPL and WPL also periodically engage in related transactions in PJM’s bid/offer-based wholesale
energy market, which are accounted for in a similar manner as the MISO transactions.







Financial Transmission Rights (FTRs) and Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs)- In areas of constrained
transmission capacity, costs could be higher due to congestion and their impact on locational marginal prices. As part of the MISO market restructuring in 2005, physical transmission rights of IPL and WPL were replaced with FTRs. FTRs provide a
hedge for congestion costs that occur in the MISO day-ahead energy market. Both IPL and WPL are allocated ARRs from MISO each year based on historical use of the transmission system. The revenue rights associated with these ARRs are used by IPL and
WPL to acquire FTRs through the FTR auctions operated by MISO. IPL’s and WPL’s current FTRs acquired from ARRs extend through May 31, 2012. MISO re-allocates ARRs annually based on a fiscal year from June 1 through May 31.
Based on the FTRs awarded to IPL and WPL to-date and future expected allocations of ARRs, along with the expected regulatory recovery treatment of MISO costs, the financial impacts associated with FTRs have not differed significantly from the
financial impacts associated with physical transmission rights that existed prior to the MISO wholesale energy market.

Ancillary Services
Market- In 2009, MISO launched an ancillary services market, which integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency reserves with the existing wholesale energy market implemented in 2005. Regulation reserves refer to generation
available to meet the moment-to-moment changes in generation that are necessary to meet changes in electricity demand. Contingency reserves refer to additional generation or demand response resources, either on-line or that can be brought on-line
within 10 minutes, to meet certain major events such as the loss of a large generating unit or transmission line.

MISO and PJM Market Flow
Corrections- In 2009, MISO and PJM disclosed an error in the calculation of market flow data between the two independent system operators that began in 2005. The error resulted in incorrect payments between MISO and PJM during 2005 through
2009. Because IPL and WPL participated in both the MISO and PJM markets during the period of the error, IPL and WPL may have been entitled to refunds or may have been required to make additional payments to MISO and/or PJM. In 2010, MISO and PJM
filed complaints against each other with FERC. In January 2011, MISO and PJM filed a settlement, which was approved by FERC in June 2011. Under the settlement, payments were not exchanged between MISO and PJM, resulting in no direct financial impact
to Alliant Energy, IPL or WPL. Instead, process changes were established, including a baseline review of market-to-market processes and accounting, establishment of a change management process regarding the same biennial review of process changes,
and enhanced access to pertinent data enabling independent verification of calculations related to settlements. Future market-to-market billing adjustment claims are limited to one year before the error is discovered compared to the previous
two-year limitation.

2) GAS UTILITY OPERATIONS

General- Gas utility operations represent the second largest operating segment for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL. Alliant Energy’s gas
utility operations are located in the Midwest with IPL providing gas service in Iowa and southern Minnesota, and WPL providing gas service in southern and central Wisconsin. Refer to the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional
details regarding gas utility operations.

Jurisdictions-Gas utility revenues by state were as follows (dollars in millions):



201120102009AmountPercentAmountPercentAmountPercentIPL:Iowa$263.355%$261.554%$295.256%Minnesota13.03%12.83%13.63%Subtotal276.358%274.357%308.859%WPL:Wisconsin200.442%206.343%216.541%$476.7100%$480.6100%$525.3100%

Customers-The number of gas customers and communities served at Dec. 31, 2011 were as follows:



RetailCustomersTransportation /Other CustomersTotalCustomersCommunitiesServedIPL233,715273233,988243WPL179,945227180,172239413,660500414,160482

IPL’s and WPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under base rates established by the IUB, MPUC or
PSCW that include recovery of and a return on investments in gas infrastructure and recovery of costs required to serve customers. Commodity, storage and transportation costs incurred by IPL and WPL are recovered pursuant to natural gas cost
recovery mechanisms. In addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy’s distribution systems to the
customers’ meters. Revenues are collected for this service pursuant to transportation tariffs. Refer to “Rate Matters” in MDA for discussion of potential retail gas rate filings by IPL and WPL in 2012.

Seasonality-Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a large heating peak occurring during the winter
season. Natural gas obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements. Storage contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer, store the gas in underground
storage fields and deliver it in the winter.

Competition- Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring more
competition to the gas industry. While the gas utility distribution function is expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and related services are subject to competition from third parties. It remains uncertain if,
and when, the current economic disincentives for smaller consumption customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be removed such that the utility business begins to face competition for the sale of gas to those customers.

Gas Supply- IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 70 suppliers of natural gas from various gas producing regions
of the U.S. and Canada. The majority of the gas supply contracts are for terms of six months or less, with the remaining supply contracts having terms through March 2014. IPL’s and WPL’s gas supply commitments are primarily market-based.

Recently, natural gas prices have fallen to levels not seen in a decade. Prices have fallen largely due to surging supply caused by shale gas
production. Given the tariffs for IPL’s and WPL’s retail gas customers provide for subsequent adjustments to their rates in the cost of gas sold, the decreased natural gas prices do not have a material impact on their respective gas
margins.







In providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services administers a diversified
portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on behalf of IPL and WPL. Transportation contracts with Northern Natural Gas Company (NNG), ANR, Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America (NGPL), Guardian Pipeline (Guardian) and Northern Border Pipeline
(NBPL) allow access to gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada. Arrangements with Firm Citygate Supplies (FCS) provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its service territory. In 2011, the maximum daily delivery capacity for IPL and WPL was as
follows (in Dths):

using a rolling 20-year average of historical heating degree days.







3) STEAM UTILITY OPERATIONS -IPL has historically provided steam service to
approximately 200 customers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, who used high-pressure steam for production purposes or low-pressure steam for hot water and heat. Substantially all of the steam for these customers was generated by IPL’s Prairie Creek
Generating Station (Prairie Creek) and Sixth Street Generating Station (Sixth Street) in Cedar Rapids prior to June 2008. In June 2008, Prairie Creek and Sixth Street were shutdown as a result of significant damage caused by severe flooding in
downtown Cedar Rapids. Soon after the flood waters receded, IPL made necessary repairs to its steam distribution systems and established temporary steam generating systems (natural gas-fired package boilers and water treatment systems) to resume
steam service for its customers. Following months of evaluations and discussions with its steam customers, IPL announced in 2009 its decision to discontinue providing temporary steam service to those steam customers located in downtown Cedar Rapids
previously served by Sixth Street. IPL ceased low-pressure steam operations in downtown Cedar Rapids in December 2009 and high-pressure steam operations in downtown Cedar Rapids in the second quarter of 2010. Prairie Creek was returned to service in
2009 and is expected to be the primary source of steam for IPL’s remaining two high-pressure steam customers in the future.

IPL’s
largest remaining high-pressure steam customer accounts for approximately 95% of IPL’s steam revenues. This customer is under contract through 2025 for annual steam usage of at least 3.8 million Dths, with certain conditions. IPL is
currently negotiating a 10-year contract with the other remaining high-pressure steam customer for annual steam usage of at least 175,000 Dths, with certain conditions.

D. INFORMATION RELATING TO NON-REGULATED OPERATIONS

Resourcesmanages a portfolio of wholly-owned subsidiaries and additional investments through several distinct platforms: Transportation, RMT,
Non-regulated Generation and other non-regulated investments.

Transportation -includes a short-line railway that provides freight
service between Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; a barge terminal and hauling services on the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services.

RMT -provides renewable energy services to clients throughout the U.S., including facility siting, permitting, design, procurement, construction and high voltage connection services for wind and
solar projects. In February 2012, Alliant Energy announced plans to sell RMT in 2012.
