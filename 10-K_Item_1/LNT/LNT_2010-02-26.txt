3)  REGULATION-Alliant Energy, IPL and
WPL are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local
agencies.  The following includes the primary regulations impacting
Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s businesses.



Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)-

Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (PUHCA 2005)- Alliant Energy is
registered with FERC as a public utility holding company, pursuant to PUHCA
2005, and is required to maintain certain records and to report certain
transactions involving its public utilities and other entities regulated by
FERC.  IPL and WPL are subject to regulation by FERC under PUHCA 2005
for various issues including, but not limited to, affiliate transactions, public
utility mergers, acquisitions and dispositions, issuance of securities (IPL
only) and books and records requirements.



Energy
Policy Act- The Energy Policy Act requires creation of an Electric
Reliability Organization (ERO) to provide oversight by FERC.  FERC
designated the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) as the
overarching ERO.  The Midwest Reliability Organization, which is a
regional member of NERC, has direct responsibility for mandatory electric
reliability standards for IPL and WPL.



Federal
Power Act- FERC also has jurisdiction, under the Federal Power Act, over
certain electric utility facilities and operations, electric wholesale and
transmission rates, dividend payments and accounting practices of IPL and
WPL.



Electric
Wholesale Rates- Corporate Services, as agent for both IPL and WPL, has
received wholesale electric market-based rate authority from
FERC.  Market-based rate authorization allows for wholesale sales of
electricity within the Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator (MISO)
energy and ancillary services markets and in bilateral markets, based on the
market value of the transactions.



Electric
Transmission Rates- FERC regulates the rates charged for electric
transmission facilities used in interstate commerce.  Neither IPL nor
WPL own or operate electric transmission facilities; however, both IPL and WPL
pay for the use of the interstate electric transmission system based upon
FERC-regulated rates.  IPL relies primarily upon the use of the ITC
Midwest LLC (ITC) transmission system.  Refer to “Other Matters -
Other Future Considerations - IPL’s Electric Transmission Service Charges” in
MDA for additional information regarding transmission service charges from ITC,
including a FERC 206 complaint filed by IPL against ITC in 2008.  WPL
relies primarily upon the use of the ATC transmission system.



National
Gas Act- FERC regulates the transportation and sale for resale of
natural gas in interstate commerce under the Natural Gas Act.  Under
the Natural Gas Act, FERC has authority over certain natural gas facilities and
operations of IPL and WPL.



Environmental- -The EPA administers certain federal regulatory programs and has
delegated the administration of other environmental regulatory programs to the
applicable state environmental agencies.  In general, the state
agencies have jurisdiction over air and water quality, hazardous substances
management and transportation, and solid waste management
requirements.  In certain cases, the state environmental agencies have
delegated the administration of environmental programs to local
agencies.  Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL are subject to these
environmental regulations as a result of their current and past
operations.



IUB- -IPL is subject to regulation by the IUB related to its operations in
Iowa for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and
standards of service, accounting requirements and approval of the location and
construction of electric generating facilities.



Retail
Utility Base Rates- IPL files periodic requests with the IUB for retail
rate relief.  These filings are based on historical test
periods.  The historical test periods may be adjusted for certain
known and measurable capital additions placed in service by IPL within nine
months from the end of the historical test period and certain known and
measurable operating and maintenance expenses incurred by IPL within 12 months
of the commencement of the proceeding.  The IUB must decide on
requests for retail rate relief within 10 months of the date of the application
for which relief is filed, or the interim rates granted become
permanent.  Interim retail rates can be placed in effect 10 days after
the rate application filing, subject to refund, and must be based on past
precedent.




Retail
Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms- IPL’s retail electric and natural
gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment clause for changes in prudently
incurred commodity costs required to serve its retail customers.  Any
over/under collection of commodity costs for each given month are automatically
reflected in future billings to retail customers.



New
Electric Generating Facilities- A Certificate of Public Convenience, Use
and Necessity (GCU Certificate) application is required to be filed with the IUB
for construction approval of any new electric generating facility located in
Iowa with 25 megawatts (MW) or more of capacity.



Advance
Rate Making Principles- Iowa Code §476.53 (formerly referred to as HF
577) provides Iowa utilities with rate making principles prior to making certain
generation investments in Iowa.  Under Iowa Code §476.53, IPL must
file for, and the IUB must provide, rate making principles for electric
generating facilities located in Iowa that have received construction approval
including new base-load (primarily defined as nuclear or coal-fired generation)
facilities with a capacity of 300 MW or more, combined-cycle natural gas-fired
facilities of any size and renewable generating resources, such as wind
facilities, of any size.  Upon approval of rate making principles by
the IUB, IPL must either build the facility under the approved rate making
principles, or not at all.



Public
Service Commission of Wisconsin(PSCW)- -Alliant Energy is subject to regulation by the PSCW for the type and
amount of Alliant Energy’s investments in non-utility businesses and other
affiliated interest activities, among other issues.  WPL is also
subject to regulation by the PSCW related to its operations in Wisconsin for
various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates and standards
of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds of securities,
approval of the location and construction of electric generating facilities and
certain other additions and extensions to facilities.



Retail
Utility Base Rates- WPL files periodic requests with the PSCW for retail
rate relief.  These filings are required to be based on
forward-looking test periods.  There is no statutory time limit for
the PSCW to decide retail rate requests.  However, the PSCW attempts
to process base retail rate cases in approximately 10 months and has the ability
to approve interim retail rate relief, subject to refund, if
necessary.



Retail
Commodity Cost Recovery Mechanisms -

Electric- - WPL’s retail electric rates are based on estimates of annual fuel-related
costs (includes fuel and purchased power energy costs) anticipated during the
test period.  During each electric retail rate proceeding, the PSCW
sets fuel monitoring ranges based on the forecasted fuel-related costs used to
determine rates in such proceeding.  If WPL’s actual fuel-related
costs fall outside these fuel monitoring ranges, the PSCW can authorize an
adjustment to future retail electric rates.



The fuel
monitoring ranges set by the PSCW consist of unit cost variances between
monitoring levels and actual unit costs and include three different ranges based
on monthly costs, cumulative costs and revised forecasted annual costs during
the test-year period.  In order for WPL, or others, to initiate a
proceeding to change rates related to fuel-related costs during the test period,
WPL, or others, must demonstrate: a) that either 1) any actual monthly costs
during the test period exceeded the monthly ranges or 2) the actual cumulative
costs to date during the test period exceeded the cumulative ranges; and b) that
the annual projected costs (that include cumulative actual costs) for the test
period also exceed the annual ranges.  In December 2009, the PSCW
approved an order continuing WPL’s fuel monitoring ranges of plus or minus 8%
for the monthly range; for the cumulative range, plus or minus 8% for the first
month, plus or minus 5% for the second month, and plus or minus 2% for the
remaining months of the monitoring period; and plus or minus 2% for the annual
range.  For fuel-only retail rate changes, the PSCW attempts to
provide interim changes effective within 21 days of notice to
customers.  There is no statutory time limit for final fuel-only
retail rate change decisions.



Natural
Gas- WPL’s retail natural gas tariffs contain an automatic adjustment
clause for changes in prudently incurred natural gas costs required to serve its
retail gas customers.  Any over/under collection of natural gas costs
for each given month are automatically reflected in future billings to retail
customers.



New
Electric Generating Facilities- A Certificate of Authority (CA)
application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of
any new electric generating facility with a capacity of less than 100
MW.  A Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN)
application is required to be filed with the PSCW for construction approval of
any new electric generating facility with a capacity of 100 MW or
more.  In addition, WPL’s ownership and operation of electric
generating facilities (including those located in Minnesota) to serve Wisconsin
customers is subject to retail utility rate regulation by the PSCW.




In June
2008, WPL filed a CPCN application with the PSCW to construct WPL’s Bent Tree -
Phase I wind project, which proposed the installation of a 200 MW wind
generating facility in Minnesota.  In a November 2008 interim order,
the PSCW interpreted the CA and CPCN statutes in relationship to constructing
more than 100 MW of capacity outside of Wisconsin, an issue that is not
specifically addressed in either the CA or the CPCN statute.  The PSCW
determined that WPL’s Bent Tree - Phase I application must be reviewed under the
CA statute and not the CPCN statute, and processed WPL’s application as a CA
application.



In August
2009, Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group, Inc. and Citizens Utility Board filed a
Petition for Review with the Circuit Court of Dane County, Wisconsin seeking
judicial review of: 1) the PSCW’s November 2008 interim order that determined
WPL’s application for the Bent Tree - Phase I wind project must be reviewed
under the CA statute and not the CPCN statute; and 2) the PSCW’s July 2009 final
order that granted WPL a CA to construct the Bent Tree - Phase I wind
project.  In October 2009, the PSCW filed a motion to dismiss the
petition.



Advance
Rate Making Principles- Wisconsin Statutes §196.371 (formerly referred
to as Act 7) provides Wisconsin utilities with the opportunity to request rate
making principles prior to the purchase or construction of any nuclear or
fossil-fueled electric generating facility or renewable generating resource,
such as a wind facility, utilized to serve Wisconsin customers.  WPL
is not obligated to file for or accept authorized rate making principles under
Wisconsin Statutes §196.371.  WPL can proceed with an approved project
under traditional rate making terms.



Minnesota
Public Utilities Commission (MPUC)- -IPL is subject to regulation by the MPUC related to its operations in
Minnesota for various issues including, but not limited to, retail utility rates
and standards of service, accounting requirements, issuance and use of proceeds
of securities, periodic approval of IPL’s capital structure, and approval of the
location and construction of electric generating facilities located in Minnesota
with a capacity in excess of 50 MW.



Retail
Utility Rates- Requests for retail rate relief can be based on either
historical or projected data and interim retail rates are
permitted.  Unless otherwise ordered, the MPUC must reach a final
decision within 10 months of filing for retail rate relief.  In
February 2010, legislation (H.R. 2798 and S. 2519) was introduced in the
Minnesota legislature that would allow a utility to implement interim retail
rates only when the MPUC finds an immediate and compelling necessity exists for
interim rate relief.  If the MPUC finds that interim rate relief is
necessary, the MPUC may authorize an interim rate schedule under which the
utility’s revenues would be increased by an amount deemed necessary to prevent
harm to the public or utility.  Alliant Energy and IPL are currently
unable to determine the ultimate impact of this proposed legislation on their
financial condition and results of operations.



Refer to
Notes 1(b), 1(h), 2 and 12(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements;” and “Rate Matters,” “Environmental Matters” and
“Legislative Matters” in MDA for additional information regarding regulation and
utility rate matters.



4)  STRATEGIC
OVERVIEW -Refer to “Strategic Overview” in MDA for discussion of various
strategic actions by Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.



C.  INFORMATION
RELATING TO UTILITY OPERATIONS



Alliant
Energy’s utility business (IPL and WPL) has three segments: a) electric
operations; b) gas operations; and c) other, which includes IPL’s steam
operations, various other energy-related products and services and the
unallocated portions of the utility business.  In 2009, IPL’s and
WPL’s operating revenues and operating income (loss) by these three utility
business segments were as follows:

1)  ELECTRIC UTILITYOPERATIONS

General- -Electric utility operations represent the largest operating segment for
Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  Alliant Energy’s electric utility
operations are located in the Midwest with IPL and WPL providing electric
service in Iowa, southern and central Wisconsin and southern
Minnesota.  Refer to the “Electric Operating Information” tables for
additional details regarding electric utility operations.

IPL and
WPL provide electric utility service to a diversified base of retail customers
in several industries, with the largest concentrations in the food
manufacturing, chemical (including ethanol) and paper
industries.  IPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed
under base rates established by the IUB or MPUC that include recovery of
purchased electric capacity costs, electric transmission service costs and other
costs required to serve customers.  IPL’s electric production fuel and
energy purchases costs are recovered pursuant to fuel adjustment
clauses.  WPL’s retail customers in the above table are billed under
base rates established by the PSCW that include recovery of electric production
fuel and purchased energy costs, purchased electric capacity costs, electric
transmission service costs and other costs required to serve
customers.  The electric fuel rules in Wisconsin allow the PSCW to
authorize rate increases/decreases if electric production fuel and energy
purchases costs exceed or fall below established fuel monitoring
ranges.



Wholesale
customers in the above table, which primarily consist of municipalities and
rural electric cooperatives, are billed under wholesale service
agreements.  These agreements include standardized pricing mechanisms
that are detailed in tariffs approved by FERC through wholesale rate case
proceedings.



In
addition, IPL and WPL have bulk power customers, included in “Other customers”
in the above table, that are billed according to negotiated, long-term
customer-specific contracts, pursuant to FERC-approved tariffs.




Seasonality-Electric sales are seasonal to some extent with the annual peak normally
occurring in the summer months due to air conditioning
requirements.  In 2009, the maximum peak hour demands for Alliant
Energy, IPL and WPL were 5,491 MW, 2,981 MW and 2,558 MW, respectively, all on
June 23, 2009.



Competition-Retail electric customers in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota currently do
not have the ability to choose their electric supplier.  However, IPL
and WPL attempt to attract new customers into their service territories in an
effort to keep energy rates low for all.  Although electric service in
Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota is regulated, IPL and WPL still face competition
from self-generation by large industrial customers, alternative energy sources,
and petitions to municipalize (Iowa) as well as service territory expansions by
municipal utilities through annexations (Wisconsin).  Refer to “Other
Matters - Other Future Considerations - Electric Sales Projections - Customer
Owned Generation” in MDA for information on the recent construction of
cogeneration facilities by two of IPL’s industrial customers.



In
November 2009, WPL filed a request with the PSCW for approval of a proposed
economic development program to attract and retain industrial customers in WPL’s
service territory.  If approved, the proposed program would permit WPL
to provide eligible industrial customers a discounted energy rate based upon
specifically-defined conditions.  To be eligible for the proposed
program, each customer would need to demonstrate that they were also eligible
for direct governmental assistance through a local, state or federal economic
development program, in addition to other criteria.  The discount
amounts would be limited to ensure recovery of marginal costs and would be
continually decreased until a customer was paying the full tariff
rate.  WPL currently anticipates receiving a decision from the PSCW
regarding this filing in the first half of 2010.



Renewable
Energy Standards

Iowa -Electric utilities in Iowa are required to purchase or own their
proportionate share of 105 MW of capacity and associated energy from alternate
energy or small hydro facilities located in the utilities’ service
area.  IPL’s proportionate share is approximately 50 MW.  As
of Dec. 31, 2009, IPL had met the requirements of this renewable energy
standard.



Wisconsin
- -A Wisconsin Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) was established in 2006
that requires electric utilities in Wisconsin, including WPL, to increase the
portion of their total Wisconsin retail electric sales supplied by renewable
energy sources above a benchmark of average retail sales from renewables in
2001, 2002 and 2003.  The RPS requires a 2% increase above the
benchmark by 2010 and a 6% increase above the benchmark by
2015.  Based on this RPS, WPL is required to supply a minimum of 6%
and 10% of its total Wisconsin retail electric sales with renewable energy
sources by 2010 and 2015, respectively.  Wisconsin utilities may reach
the RPS with renewable energy generated by the utility, acquired under purchased
power agreements (PPAs), or through the use of renewable resource
credits.



Minnesota
- -A Minnesota Renewable Energy Standard (RES) was established in 2007
that requires electric utilities operating in Minnesota, including IPL, to
supply a minimum level of their total Minnesota retail electric sales with
renewable energy sources by certain future dates.  Based on this RES,
IPL’s total Minnesota retail electric sales supplied with renewable energy
sources must be at least 12% by 2012; 17% by 2016; 20% by 2020; and 25% by
2025.  Utilities in Minnesota may meet the requirements of the RES
with renewable energy generated by the utility, renewable energy acquired under
PPAs or the use of renewable resource credits.



Refer to
“Strategic Overview - Utility Generation Plans” in MDA for discussion of Alliant
Energy’s utility generation plan, which includes additional supply from wind
generation that is expected to contribute towards meeting renewable energy
requirements discussed above.



Energy
Conservation-With increased emphasis on energy conservation as a matter of public
policy, IPL and WPL are continuing and, where appropriate, expanding initiatives
to promote energy conservation and enhance customers’ ability to manage their
energy use more efficiently.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Energy
Efficiency Programs” in MDA for discussion of current energy efficiency programs
at IPL and WPL.




Electric
Supply

- -



Electric
Demand Planning Reserve Margin (PRM)- IPL and WPL are required to
maintain a PRM above their projected annual peak demand forecast to help ensure
reliability of electric service to their customers.  WPL is required
to maintain a 14.5% PRM for long-term planning (planning years two through 10)
and a PRM established by MISO for short-term planning.  PRM
requirements for IPL follow MISO’s reserve requirements.  IPL and WPL
currently have adequate capacity to meet the MISO PRM requirements.



Generation
- -IPL and WPL own a portfolio of electric generating facilities located
in Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota with a diversified fuel mix including coal,
natural gas and renewable resources.  Refer to Item 2. Properties for
details of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating stations.



Generating
Capacity- The generating capacity of IPL’s and WPL’s electric generating
facilities is based upon MISO’s resource adequacy process, which uses the
unforced capacity of the generating facilities.  The generating
capacity for the June 2009 to May 2010 planning period by fuel type in MWs was
as follows:



IPLWPLTotalCoal1,5901,2312,821Natural
      gas8226281,450Oil292--292Wind

(a)  Represents
20% of the capacity of wind projects owned by IPL and WPL based upon the MISO
resource adequacy process for wind projects for the planning period from June
2009 to May 2010.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, wind projects owned by Alliant
Energy included IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin
County, Iowa and WPL’s 68 MW Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County,
Wisconsin.



Fuel
Costs- -The average cost of delivered fuel per million British Thermal Units
used for electric generation was as follows:

(a) The
average cost of natural gas is impacted by gains and losses from swap contracts
used to hedge the price of natural gas volumes expected to be used by Alliant
Energy’s natural gas-fired electric generating facilities.




Coal-Coal is the primary fuel source for Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s internally
generated electric supply and generally represents approximately 50% of their
total sources of electric energy.  Alliant Energy, through Corporate
Services as agent for IPL and WPL, has entered into contracts with different
suppliers to help ensure that a specified supply of coal is available at known
prices for IPL’s and WPL’s coal-fired generating facilities for 2010 through
2012.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, existing contracts provide for a portfolio
of coal supplies that cover approximately 91%, 62%, and 6% of Alliant Energy’s
estimated coal supply needs for 2010, 2011 and 2012,
respectively.  Alliant Energy believes this portfolio of coal supplies
represents a reasonable balance between the risks of insufficient supplies and
those associated with being unable to respond to future coal market
changes.  Alliant Energy expects to meet remaining coal requirements
from either future contracts or purchases in the spot market.  Alliant
Energy, through its subsidiaries Corporate Services, IPL and WPL, also enters
into various coal transportation contracts to meet its coal supply
agreements.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, existing coal transportation
agreements cover approximately 80%, 67%, 67%, 47%, and 47% of Alliant Energy’s
estimated coal transportation needs for 2010 through 2014,
respectively.



The
majority of the coal utilized by IPL and WPL is from the Wyoming Powder River
Basin.  A majority of this coal is transported by rail-car directly
from Wyoming to IPL’s and WPL’s generating stations, with the remainder
transported from Wyoming to the Mississippi River by rail-car and then via
barges to the final destination.  As protection against interruptions
in coal deliveries, IPL and WPL strive to maintain average coal inventory supply
targets of 25 to 50 days for generating stations with year-round deliveries and
30 to 150 days (depending upon the time of year) for generating stations with
seasonal deliveries.  Actual inventory averages for 2009 were 82 days
for generating stations with year-round deliveries and 210 days for generating
stations with seasonal deliveries.  The average days on hand were
computed based on actual tons of inventory divided by average daily tons burned
in 2009.  Average days on hand increased in 2009 primarily due to
lower coal volumes burned as a result of reduced generation needed to serve the
lower sales volumes in 2009.  Alliant Energy periodically tests coal
from sources other than the Wyoming Powder River Basin to determine which
alternative sources of coal are most compatible with its generating
stations.  Access to alternative sources of coal is expected to
provide Alliant Energy with further protection against interruptions and lessen
its dependence on its primary coal source.





Given its
current coal procurement process, the specific coal market in its primary
purchase region and regulatory cost-recovery mechanisms, Alliant Energy believes
it is reasonably insulated against coal price volatility. Alliant Energy’s coal
procurement process stresses periodic purchases, staggering of contract terms,
stair-stepped levels of supply going forward for multiple years and supplier
diversity. Similarly, given the term lengths of its transportation agreements,
Alliant Energy believes it is reasonably insulated against future higher coal
transportation rates from the major railroads.



Natural
Gas- Alliant Energy owns several natural gas-fired generating facilities
including IPL’s 565 MW Emery Generating Station, WPL’s 300 MW Neenah Energy
Facility and Resources’ 300 MW Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility.  WPL
has exclusive rights to the output of the Sheboygan Falls Energy Facility under
an affiliated lease agreement.  These facilities help meet customer
demand for electricity generally during peak hour demands.  Internally
generated electric supply from natural gas-fired generating facilities generally
represent less than 5% of Alliant Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of
electric energy.  Refer to Note 1(e) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements” for additional information on WPL’s purchase
of the Neenah Energy Facility from Resources in June 2009.




Alliant
Energy has responsibility to supply natural gas to the generating facilities it
owns as well as Riverside, which WPL has rights to under a PPA.  WPL
has contracts with several companies to provide fixed-price natural gas supply
for these generating facilities with the longest contracts having terms through
August 2010.  WPL has also contracted with ANR Pipeline to provide
firm pipeline transportation of 60,000 dekatherms (Dths) per day for Riverside
and 2 million Dths of storage capacity for WPL’s natural gas-fired generating
facilities.  IPL has also contracted with Northern Border Pipeline to
provide firm pipeline transportation of 50,000 Dths per day for the Emery
Generating Station through March 2010.



Nuclear-In January 2006, IPL sold its interest in the Duane Arnold Energy Center
(DAEC) to a subsidiary of FPL Group, Inc. (FPL) and upon closing of the sale
entered into a PPA with FPL to purchase energy and capacity from DAEC through
February 2014.  In July 2005, WPL sold its interest in the Kewaunee
Nuclear Power Plant (Kewaunee) to a subsidiary of Dominion Resources, Inc.
(Dominion) and upon closing of the sale entered into a long-term PPA with
Dominion to purchase energy and capacity from Kewaunee through December
2013.  As a result of these transactions, Alliant Energy no longer has
an ownership interest in any nuclear generating facilities.  Alliant
Energy entered into these transactions to reduce the financial and operational
uncertainty associated with nuclear generating facility ownership and operations
while still retaining the benefit of the output from such nuclear generating
facilities.



Wind- - IPL’s 200 MW Whispering Willow - East wind project in Franklin County, Iowa
began commercial operation in the fourth quarter of 2009.  WPL’s 68 MW
Cedar Ridge wind project in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin began commercial
operation in the fourth quarter of 2008.  Whispering Willow - East and
Cedar Ridge are the first fully owned and operated wind projects for IPL and
WPL, respectively.  Refer to “Strategic Overview - Utility Generation
Plans” in MDA for discussion of additional wind projects included in the Utility
Generation Plans.



Purchased
Power -IPL and WPL enter into PPAs and purchase electricity from
wholesale energy markets to meet a portion of their customer demand for
electricity.  Purchased power represented almost 50% of Alliant
Energy’s, IPL’s and WPL’s total sources of electric energy in
2009.  IPL’s most significant PPA is with FPL for the purchase of
energy and capacity from DAEC through February 2014.  WPL’s most
significant PPAs are with Dominion for the purchase of energy and capacity from
Kewaunee through December 2013 and with a subsidiary of Calpine Corporation for
the purchase of energy and capacity from Riverside through May
2013.



Refer to
Note 1(h) for discussion of IPL’s and WPL’s rate recovery of electric production
fuel and purchased energy costs, Note 3(a) for details regarding PPAs accounted
for as operating leases and Note 12(b) for details on IPL’s and WPL’s coal,
natural gas and other purchased power commitments in Alliant Energy’s “Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements.”



Electric
Transmission-

IPL




WPL- - WPL transferred its transmission assets to ATC in 2001 in exchange for an
ownership interest in ATC.  As of Dec. 31, 2009, WPL held a 16%
ownership interest in ATC with a carrying value of $219 million.  WPL
currently anticipates making capital contributions of $3 million, $4 million and
$3 million to ATC in 2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, to maintain its current
ownership percentage.  During 2009, ATC distributed to WPL, in the
form of dividends, $29 million or approximately 80% of WPL’s equity earnings
from ATC.  Although no assurance can be given, WPL anticipates ATC
will continue this dividend payout ratio in the future.  ATC is an
independent for-profit, transmission-only company and is a transmission-owning
member of the MISO RTO, Midwest Reliability Organization and Reliability First
Corporation Regional Entities.  ATC has transmission interconnections
with various other transmission owning utilities in the
Midwest.  These interconnections enhance the overall reliability of
the WPL delivery system and provide access to multiple sources of economic and
emergency energy.  WPL currently receives substantially all its
transmission services from ATC.  Refer to Note 20 of Alliant Energy’s
“Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” for details of agreements between
ATC and WPL.



MISO
Markets- IPL and WPL are members of MISO, a FERC-approved RTO, which is
responsible for monitoring and ensuring equal access to the transmission system
in their service territories.  IPL and WPL participate in the
wholesale energy market and ancillary services markets operated by MISO, which
are discussed in more detail below.



Wholesale
Energy Market -IPL and WPL began participation in the wholesale energy
market operated by MISO in 2005.  The market impacts the way IPL and
WPL buy and sell wholesale electricity, obtain transmission services, schedule
generation and ensure resource adequacy to reliably serve load.  In
the market, IPL and WPL submit day-ahead and/or real-time bids and offers for
energy at locations across the MISO region.  MISO evaluates IPL’s,
WPL’s and other market participants’ energy injections into, and withdrawals
from, the system to economically dispatch the entire MISO system on an hourly
basis.  MISO settles these hourly offers and bids based on locational
marginal prices, which are market-driven values based on the specific time and
location of the purchase and/or sale of energy.  The market is
intended to send price signals to stakeholders where generation or transmission
system expansion is needed.  This market-based approach is expected to
result in lower overall costs in areas with abundant transmission
capacity.  In addition, MISO may dispatch generators that support
reliability needs, but which would not have operated based on economic
needs.  In these cases, MISO’s settlement assures that these
generators are made whole financially for variable costs.



Financial
Transmission Rights (FTRs) and Auction Revenue Rights (ARRs)- In areas
of constrained transmission capacity, such as Wisconsin, costs could be higher
due to congestion and its impact on locational marginal prices.  As
part of the MISO market restructuring in 2005, physical transmission rights of
IPL and WPL were replaced with FTRs.  FTRs provide a hedge for
congestion costs that occur in the MISO day-ahead energy market.  Both
IPL and WPL are allocated ARRs from MISO each year based on historical use of
the transmission system.  The revenues from these ARRs are used by IPL
and WPL to acquire FTRs through the FTR auctions operated by
MISO.  IPL’s and WPL’s current FTRs acquired from ARRs extend through
May 31, 2010.  MISO re-allocates ARRs annually based on a fiscal year
from June 1 through May 31.  Based on the FTRs awarded to IPL and WPL
to-date and future expected allocations of ARRs, along with the expected
regulatory recovery treatment of MISO costs, the financial impacts associated
with FTRs have not differed significantly from the financial impacts associated
with physical transmission rights that existed prior to the MISO wholesale
energy market.



Ancillary
Services Market- In January 2009, MISO launched an ancillary services
market, which integrates the procurement and use of regulation and contingency
reserves with the existing wholesale energy market implemented in
2005.  Regulation refers to the moment-to-moment changes in generation
that are necessary to meet changes in electricity demand.  Contingency
reserves refer to additional generation or demand response resources, either
on-line or that can be brought on-line within 10 minutes, to meet certain major
events such as the loss of a large generating unit or transmission
line.  MISO plans to address in 2011 refinements to its ancillary
services market requested by market participants.



MISO
Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) Settlements -In 2008, FERC issued
two orders requiring MISO to resettle two separate amounts of historical RSG
charges from its wholesale energy market.  These resettlements involve
MISO collecting RSG charges from some market participants and refunding the
collected amounts to other market participants.  In May and June 2009,
FERC issued two orders reversing portions of its 2008 orders that reduced the
amount of anticipated RSG resettlements compared to initial
estimates.  Various FERC orders related to RSG settlements and
resettlements are subject to FERC rehearing or have been appealed to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  In 2009, IPL and WPL received
$2 million and $1 million, respectively, of net benefits from the two
resettlements, including interest.




MISO
and PJM Interconnection, LLC (PJM) Market Flow Corrections- In August
2009, MISO and PJM disclosed an error in the calculation of market flow data
between the two independent system operators that began in 2005.  The
error resulted in incorrect payments between MISO and PJM during 2005 through
2009.  Because IPL and WPL participated in both the MISO and PJM
markets during the period of the error, IPL and WPL may be entitled to refunds
or may be required to make additional payments to the two independent system
operators.  MISO and PJM are currently in settlement discussions
regarding this matter.  IPL and WPL are currently unable to predict
the ultimate resolution of this matter.  However, the net impact of
payments to or refunds from these two independent system operations to resolve
this matter is not expected to have a material adverse impact on IPL’s or WPL’s
financial condition and results of operation.

2)  GAS UTILITYOPERATIONS

General- -Gas utility operations represent the second largest operating segment
for Alliant Energy, IPL and WPL.  Alliant Energy’s gas utility
operations are located in the Midwest with IPL and WPL providing gas service in
Iowa, southern and central Wisconsin and southern Minnesota.  Refer to
the “Gas Operating Information” tables for additional details regarding gas
utility operations.

In
addition to sales of natural gas to retail customers, IPL and WPL provide
transportation service to commercial and industrial customers by moving
customer-owned gas through Alliant Energy’s distribution systems to the
customers’ meters.  Revenues are collected for this service pursuant
to transportation tariffs.



Seasonality-Gas sales follow a seasonal pattern with an annual base-load of gas and a
large heating peak occurring during the winter season.  Natural gas
obtained from producers, marketers and brokers, as well as gas in storage, is
utilized to meet the peak heating season requirements.  Storage
contracts allow IPL and WPL to purchase gas in the summer, store the gas in
underground storage fields and deliver it in the winter.



Competition- - Federal and state regulatory policies are in place to bring more competition
to the gas industry.  While the gas utility distribution function is
expected to remain a regulated function, sales of the natural gas commodity and
related services are subject to competition from third parties.  It
remains uncertain if, and when, the current economic disincentives for smaller
consumption customers to choose an alternative gas commodity supplier may be
removed such that the utility business begins to face competition for the sale
of gas to those customers.



Gas
Supply- IPL and WPL maintain purchase agreements with over 40 suppliers
of natural gas from various gas producing regions of the U.S. and
Canada.  The majority of the gas supply contracts are for terms of six
months or less, with the remaining supply contracts having terms through March
2011.  IPL’s and WPL’s gas supply commitments are primarily
market-based.




In
providing gas commodity service to retail customers, Corporate Services
administers a diversified portfolio of transportation and storage contracts on
behalf of IPL and WPL.  Transportation contracts with Northern Natural
Gas Company (NNG), ANR Pipeline (ANR), Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America
(NGPL), Northern Border Pipeline (NBPL) and Guardian Pipeline (Guardian) allow
access to gas supplies located in the U.S. and Canada.  Arrangements
with Firm Citygate Supplies (FCS) provide IPL with gas delivered directly to its
service territory.  In 2009, the maximum daily delivery capacity for
IPL and WPL was as follows (in Dths):

FERC
Investigation of Pipeline Tariffs- In November 2009, FERC initiated
proceedings to investigate the rates of return that NNG, Great Lakes Pipeline
and NGPL earned in 2008.  FERC used data from annual filings made by
interstate pipelines to estimate the rate of return that all U.S. pipelines
earned in 2008 and concluded that these three pipelines may have earned rates of
return exceeding 20%.  The purpose of the proceeding is to determine
whether the tariff rates charged by these pipelines are set too
high.  By law, there will be no retroactive refunds as a result of
these proceedings.  However, the proceedings may result in changes to
tariff rates charged by these pipelines in the future.  Any change in
tariff rates charged by these pipelines in the future is expected to be passed
on to IPL’s and WPL’s gas customers through their respective natural gas cost
recovery mechanisms.  FERC anticipates issuing a ruling regarding
these proceedings in late 2010.

Note 1(h) for information relating to utility natural gas cost recovery
mechanisms and Note 12(b) for discussion of natural gas commitments in Alliant
Energy’s “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.”

D.  INFORMATION
RELATING TONON-REGULATEDOPERATIONS



Resourcesmanages a portfolio of wholly-owned subsidiaries and additional investments
through several distinct platforms: RMT (including WindConnect®), Non-regulated
Generation, Transportation and other non-regulated investments.



RMT -provides renewable energy services and environmental consulting and
engineering services to industrial and commercial clients
nationwide.  RMT offers renewable energy services through its
WindConnect® segment, which provides siting, design, construction, and high
voltage connection services for wind and solar projects in the
U.S.  RMT’s environmental consulting and engineering services include
site remediation and restoration, air quality control, auditing/compliance
management, facility siting and planning, and environmental
construction.



The
economic conditions during 2008 and 2009 have resulted in constrained financial
markets and lower funding for large capital projects in the renewable energy
services market.  With fewer renewable energy projects receiving
funding, the competition for those projects has intensified.  RMT is
currently among a small group of companies that has technical expertise and
project experience for all phases of a renewable energy project, from siting
through electrical grid connection.  Future growth in the renewable
energy infrastructure market may attract new competitors to the renewable energy
services market including large construction companies.



The
environmental consulting and engineering market is mature, highly fragmented,
and composed of a large number of firms ranging in size from small private
entities to large public firms.  RMT’s competitors in this market vary
by their scope of services, scale and geographical location of
projects.



Non-regulated
Generation -owns the 300 MW, simple-cycle, natural gas-fired Sheboygan
Falls Energy Facility near Sheboygan Falls, Wisconsin, which is leased to WPL
for an initial period of 20 years ending in 2025.  Also included in
Non-regulated Generation is Industrial Energy Applications, Inc., which provides
on-site energy services with small standby generators.



Transportation
- -includes a short-line railway that provides freight service between
Cedar Rapids, Iowa and Iowa City, Iowa; a barge terminal and hauling services on
the Mississippi River; and other transfer and storage services.



Other
non-regulated investments -include the Whiting Petroleum Corporation tax
sharing agreement receivable discussed in Note 4(b) of Alliant Energy’s “Notes
to Consolidated Financial Statements,” real estate investments, two corporate
airplanes and several other modest investments.
