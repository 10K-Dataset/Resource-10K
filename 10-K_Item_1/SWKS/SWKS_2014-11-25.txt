INDUSTRY BACKGROUND



Consumer demand for wireless ubiquity and the trend towards linking people, places and things in ways previously not imagined are driving connectivity across a growing number of markets and applications. This explosive demand for connectivity and consumers’ desire for anytime, anywhere access is helping fuel our growth and expand our served markets. In fact, a recent report by Morgan Stanley estimates that by 2020 the total number of connected devices could reach a staggering 75 billion. General Electric, for example, has announced that it will incorporate machine-to-machine communications across its entire industrial portfolio, including jet engines, locomotives, turbines and medical devices. This is just one example of how analog end markets are incorporating connectivity, in many cases for the first time.











In addition to the more traditional analog segments, we are embracing an entirely new generation of connected devices such as home automation systems, fitness gear and a variety of health and wellness products. While many of these products are still in the early stages of deployment, we have already captured strong positions in these new growth sectors.



The billions of connected devices that make up the Internet of Things will be enabled by a combination of sensors, microcontrollers and, most importantly for Skyworks, connectivity and power management solutions-dramatically expanding the markets we currently serve. At the same time, these connected devices are also incorporating more and more network standards.



In the connected home we have an exciting and diverse pipeline of opportunities including but not limited to gaming, entertainment, security and automation.  In the broadest sense, we are seeing increased global demand for higher data rate services, like 802.11ac and LTE for mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, which are enabling seamless connections, faster download speeds, improved signal range and longer battery life.  Smartphone manufacturers and network operators are rapidly rolling out these technologies to provide users with the best possible experience.



Solving RF Challenges



This transition to ubiquitous connectivity, however, does not come without its challenges. RF solutions in ultra-thin, high performance consumer products must preserve battery life, increase data rates and solve signal interference problems while occupying minimal board space. Meeting these design challenges requires broad competencies including signal transmission and conditioning, the ability to ensure seamless hand-offs between multiple standards, power management, voltage regulation, battery charging, filtering and tuning, among others. This complexity plays directly to Skyworks’ strengths. We have a strong heritage in analog systems design and have spent the last decade investing in key technologies and resources. We are at the forefront of advanced multi-chip module integration and offer unmatched technology breadth, providing deep expertise in CMOS, SOI, GaAs and filters and maintaining strategic partnerships with outside foundries.



SKYWORKS' STRATEGY



Skyworks' overall strategy is to enable all forms of connectivity through semiconductor innovation. Key elements in our strategy include:

By leveraging core analog and mixed signal technologies, we are expanding our family of solutions to a set of increasingly diverse end markets and customers. We are steadily growing our business beyond just mobile devices (where we support all top-tier manufacturers, including the leading smartphone suppliers and key baseband vendors) into additional high-performance analog markets, including infrastructure, smart energy, wireless networking, automotive and medical.  In these markets we leverage our scale, intellectual property and worldwide distribution network, which span over 2,000 customers and over 2,500 analog components.

Industry-Leading Technology

As the industry migrates to more complex LTE architectures across a multitude of wireless broadband applications, we are uniquely positioned to help mobile device manufacturers handle growing levels of system complexity in the transmit and receive chain.  The trend towards increasing front-end and analog design challenges in smartphones and other mobile devices plays directly into Skyworks' core strengths and positions us to address these challenges.  We believe that we offer the broadest portfolio of radio and analog solutions from the transceiver to the antenna as well as all required manufacturing process technologies.  Our expertise includes BiFET, CMOS, HBT, pHEMT, SOI and silicon germanium processes.  We also hold strong technology leadership positions in passive devices, as well as advanced integration including proprietary shielding and 3-D die stacking.  Our product portfolio is reinforced by a library of over 1,800 worldwide patents and other intellectual property that we own and control. Together, our industry-leading technology enables us to deliver the highest levels of product performance and integration.

Customer Relationships

Given our scale and technology leadership, we are engaged with key original equipment manufacturers, smartphone providers and baseband reference design partners.  Our customers value our supply chain strength, our innovative technology and our system engineering expertise resulting in deep customer loyalty. We partner with our customers to support their long-term product road maps and are valued as a system solutions provider rather than just a point product vendor.









Delivering Operational Excellence



We either vertically integrate our supply chain where we can create a competitive advantage, or enter into alliances and strategic relationships for leading-edge capabilities. This hybrid manufacturing approach allows us to better balance our manufacturing capacity with the demands of the marketplace. Internally, our capacity utilization remains high and we have therefore been able to maintain margins and achieve our desired return on invested capital on a broader range of revenue.



Additionally, we continue to strive to achieve the industry's shortest product design and manufacturing cycle times and highest yields.  The combination of agile, flexible capacity and world-class module manufacturing and scale advantage allows us to achieve a low product cost structure while integrating multiple technologies into highly sophisticated multi-chip modules.



Maintaining a Performance Driven Culture



We consider our people and corporate culture to be a major competitive advantage and a key element of our overall strategy.  We create key performance indicators that align employee performance with corporate strategy and link responsibilities with performance measurement.  Accountability is paramount and we compensate our employees through a pay-for-performance methodology.  We strive to be an employer-of-choice among peer companies and have created a work environment in which turnover is well below semiconductor industry averages.



Generating Superior Operating Results and Shareholder Returns



We seek to generate financial returns that are comparable to a highly diversified analog semiconductor company while delivering high growth rates representative of a mobile internet company.  Given our product volume and overall utilization we strive to achieve a best-in-class return on investment and operating income to reward shareholders with increasing returns.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION



Our products are primarily sold through a direct global Skyworks sales force deployed across all of our major market regions. In some markets we supplement our direct sales effort with independent manufacturers' representatives and distribution partners, some of which are franchised globally with others focused in specific regional markets.



Our sales engagement begins at the earliest stages of the design of an existing or potential customer's product. We strive to provide close technical collaboration with our customers and reference design partners at the inception of new programs. These relationships allow our team to facilitate customer-driven solutions, which leverage the unique strength of our intellectual property and product portfolio while providing high value and greatly reducing time-to-market.



We believe the technical and complex nature of our products and markets demand an extraordinary commitment to maintain close ongoing relationships with our customers. As such, we strive to expand the scope of our customer relationship to include design, engineering, manufacturing, procurement, logistics and project management. We also employ a collaborative approach in developing these relationships by combining the support of our design teams, applications engineers, manufacturing personnel, sales and marketing staff and senior management.  Lastly, we leverage our customer relationships with cross-selling opportunities across product lines in order to maximize revenue.



We believe that maintaining frequent and interactive contact with our customers is paramount to our continuous efforts to provide world-class sales and service support. By listening and responding to feedback, we are able to mobilize resources to raise our level of customer satisfaction, improve our ability to anticipate future product needs, and enhance our understanding of key market dynamics. We are confident that diligently following this path will position Skyworks to participate in numerous opportunities for growth in the future.



CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION



A small number of customers historically has accounted for a significant portion of our net revenue. In fiscal years ended October 3, 2014 (“fiscal 2014”), September 27, 2013 (“fiscal 2013”), and September 28, 2012 (“fiscal 2012”), two customers—Foxconn Technology Group (together with its affiliates and other suppliers to a large OEM for use in multiple applications including









smartphones, tablets, routers, desktop and notebook computers) and Samsung Electronics—each constituted more than ten percent of our net revenue.  For further information regarding concentrations seeNote 16to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS





COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS



The competitive environment in the semiconductor industry is in a constant state of flux, with new products continually emerging and existing products approaching technological obsolescence.  We compete on the basis of time-to-market, new product innovation, quality, performance, price, compliance with industry standards, strategic relationships with customers and baseband vendors, personnel and protection of our intellectual property. We participate in highly competitive markets against numerous competitors that may be able to adapt more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, or may be able to devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than we can.



Erosion of average selling prices of established products is typical of the semiconductor industry. Consistent with trends in the industry, we anticipate that average selling prices for our established products will continue to decline at a normalized rate of five to ten percent per year.  As part of our normal course of business, we mitigate the gross margin impact of declining average selling prices with efforts to increase unit volumes, reduce material costs and lower manufacturing costs of existing products and by introducing new and higher value-added products.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT



Our products and markets demand rapid technological advancements requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products and technologies. Accordingly, we maintain a high level of research and development activity.  We invested$252.2 million,$226.3 millionand$212.5 millionin research and development activities during fiscal 2014, fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, respectively.  The increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013 as compared to the prior fiscal year were the result of increases in our internal product designs and product development for our target markets in each of these fiscal years. Our research and development activities include new product development and innovations in integrated circuit design, investment in advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes, developing new packaging and test capabilities and researching next generation technologies and product opportunities.  We maintain close collaborative relationships with many of our customers to help identify market demands and target our development efforts to meet those demands.



RAW MATERIALS



Raw materials for our products and manufacturing processes are generally available from several sources. It is our policy not to depend on a sole source of supply unless market or other conditions dictate otherwise. Consequently, there are limited situations where we procure certain components and services for our products from single or limited sources. We purchase materials and services primarily pursuant to individual purchase orders.  However, we have entered into certain supply agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other manufacturing related services that specify minimum prices and purchase quantity based on our anticipated future requirements.  Such amounts are reviewed and included in our contractual obligations and commitments as required.  Certain of our suppliers consign raw materials to us at our manufacturing facilities which we take title to as needed in our manufacturing









process. We believe we have adequate sources for the supply of raw materials and components for our manufacturing needs with suppliers located around the world.



BACKLOG AND INVENTORY



Our sales are made pursuant to standard purchase orders and/or specified customer contracts for delivery of products, with such purchase orders officially acknowledged by us according to our own terms and conditions. We also maintain Skyworks-owned finished goods inventory at certain customer “hub” locations. We do not recognize revenue until these customers consume the Skyworks-owned inventory from these hub locations.  Due to industry practice, which allows customers to cancel orders with limited advance notice to us prior to shipment, and with little or no penalty, we believe that backlog as of any particular date may not be a reliable indicator of our future revenue levels.  The cancellation or deferral of product orders, the return of previously sold products, or overproduction due to a change in anticipated order volume could result in a reduction in revenue and us holding excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in inventory write-downs and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.



ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS



Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes, and other activities affecting the environment have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our manufacturing operations. Most of our customers have mandated that our products comply with various local, regional and national “green” initiatives initiated by our customers or the locations in which they operate. We believe that our current expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection, and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims, will not have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources, competitive position or financial condition. Environmental regulations are subject to change in the future, and accordingly we are unable to assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.



SEASONALITY



Sales of our products are subject to seasonal fluctuation and periods of increased demand in end-user consumer applications, such as smartphones and tablet computing devices. The highest demand for our products generally occurs in our first fiscal quarter ending in December and the lowest demand for our handset products generally occurs in our second fiscal quarter ending in March.



GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION



For information regarding net revenue by geographic region for each of the last three fiscal years, seeNote 16of Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.



EMPLOYEES



As ofOctober 3, 2014, we employed approximately 5,550 employees world-wide (as compared to 4,750 as of September 27, 2013). Approximately 700 of our employees in Mexico are covered by collective bargaining agreements.
