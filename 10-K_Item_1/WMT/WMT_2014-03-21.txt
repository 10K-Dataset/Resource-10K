ITEM 1.BUSINESS

General

Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Walmart," the "Company" or "we") helps people around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – in retail stores, online, and through their mobile devices.    We earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP"), while fostering a culture that rewards and embraces mutual respect, integrity and diversity.  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.

Our operations comprise three reportable business segments:  Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2014 ("fiscal 2014"), January 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013") and January 31, 2012 ("fiscal 2012").  During fiscal 2014, we generated total revenues of $476 billion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of$473 billion.

Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in various formats in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, as well as its online retail operations, walmart.com.  Walmart U.S. generated approximately59%of our net sales in fiscal2014and, of our three segments, historically has had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate"), and contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.

Walmart International consists of the Company's operations in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and its operations include numerous formats of retail stores, wholesale clubs, including Sam's Clubs, restaurants, banks and various retail websites.  Walmart International generated approximately29%of our fiscal2014net sales.  The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. because of the margin impact from its merchandise mix.  Walmart International has generally been our most rapidly growing segment, growing primarily through new stores and acquisitions and, in recent years, has been growing its net sales and operating income at a faster rate than our other segments.  However, for fiscal 2014, Walmart International sales growth slowed due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, as well as no significant acquisitions, and operating income declined as a result of certain operating expenses.

Sam's Club consists of warehouse membership clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as its online operations, samsclub.com.  Sam's Club accounted for approximately12%of our fiscal2014net sales.  Sam's Club operates as a warehouse membership club with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.

We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.

The Development of Our Company

Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas.  In 1984, we opened our first three Sam's Clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  In 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico.  Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and at January 31,2014, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 26 countries.

Merchandise.The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the U.S. stores and clubs have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the Walmart International segment operates.  In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations.The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation.  We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, check, debit and credit cards, private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers and credit cards issued by our subsidiaries in Canada, Chile and Mexico.  Limited consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.  Across the Walmart International segment, we are leveraging our best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.

Competition.The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate.  We also operate some restaurants and, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations.  We compete with others for desirable sites for new retail units.  Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which Walmart International operates.  We believe EDLP is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets and we are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to EDLP.  Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution.We utilize a total of151distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment.  During fiscal2014, approximately 80% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities.  Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate.  Of these151distribution facilities, we owned and operated42, we owned and third parties operated11, and we leased and operated62.  Third parties leased and operated the remaining36distribution facilities.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events and national and religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income have occurred in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.

Competition.Sam's Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, internet-based retailers, gasoline stations and catalog businesses.  Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites.  At Sam's Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a quality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Savings and Business members.  Our strategy allows us to differentiate ourselves within the warehouse club industry and the overall retail industry.

Distribution.During fiscal2014, approximately 64% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's dedicated distribution facilities or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities.  Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations.  As of January 31,2014, our Sam's Club segment operations were supported by23distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States.

Additionally, some of the Walmart U.S. distribution facilities also service our Sam's Club segment for certain items.

The principal focus of our Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized.  Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers.  Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour.

Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.  We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.
