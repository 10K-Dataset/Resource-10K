Our strategy is to lead on price, invest to differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.  Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP").  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Price leadership is core to who we are.  Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers.  Our omni-channel presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.  We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.

Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar year basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years endedJanuary 31, 2018("fiscal2018"),January 31, 2017("fiscal2017") andJanuary 31, 2016("fiscal2016").  During fiscal2018, we generated total revenues of$500.3 billion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of$495.8 billion.

We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.  Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."

The Development of Our Company

Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas.  In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico.  Since then, our international presence has expanded and, as ofJanuary 31, 2018, our Walmart International segment conducted business in27countries.

In 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating walmart.com.  That same year, we also created samsclub.com.  Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow.  In 2007, walmart.com launched its Site to Store service, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores.  In 2016, we acquired jet.com in the U.S. and formed a strategic alliance with JD.com in China.  Subsequent to the jet.com purchase, we have acquired several other U.S. eCommerce entities.  In 2017, walmart.com launched free two-day shipping on more than 2 million items and we created Store No8, a tech incubator with a focus to drive commerce forward.  These eCommerce efforts have led to omni-channel offerings in many markets, including over 1,100 "Online Grocery" pickup locations in the U.S.

Information About Our Segments

The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce websites, located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.

Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as eCommerce.  Walmart U.S. generated approximately64%of our net sales in fiscal2018, and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate").  In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.

Walmart International consists of operations in27countries outside of the U.S. and is divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other.  These categories consist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam's Clubs) and cash & carry, as well as eCommerce.  Walmart International generated








approximately24%of our fiscal2018net sales.  The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.  Walmart International is our second largest segment.

Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as eCommerce.  Sam's Club accounted for approximately12%of our fiscal2018net sales.  As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.

The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.

Merchandise.The merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items.  Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You" and "Extra Special."  In addition, we have developed relationships with








regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.

Operations.The hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation.  Operating units in each country accept a variety of payment methods.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.Walmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.

We compete with others for desirable sites for new or relocated units.  Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates.  We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach.  Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.  In the markets in which we have eCommerce websites or mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in our digital and physical retail operations.

Distribution.We utilize a total of188distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment.

Distribution.During fiscal2018, approximately68%of Sam's Club's non-fuel purchases were shipped from Sam's Club's22dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities, which service the Sam's Club segment for certain items.  Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations.

The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized.  Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers.  Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour.

Sam's Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.  The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.

Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased by members on samsclub.com and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.



Other Segment Information

Certain financial information relating to our segments is included inPart II, Item 7under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and inNote 15to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Note 15also includes information regarding total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations.

Intellectual Property

We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and others, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to protect our proprietary rights.  We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks and copyrights.  Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology.  We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights to third parties.

Suppliers and Supply Chain

As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online.  In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category.  Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers.  Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws.  Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.

Employees

As of the end of fiscal2018, Walmart Inc. and our subsidiaries employed approximately2.3 millionemployees ("associates") worldwide, with1.5 millionassociates in the U.S. and0.8 millionassociates internationally.  Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates.  We believe our relationships with our associates are good and are continuing to improve.  A large number of associates turn over each year, although Walmart U.S. turnover has been improving in fiscal 2018 as a result of our focus on increasing wages and providing improved tools, technology and training to associates.








Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included inNote 12to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., we offer a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates.  These include a store discount card or Sam's Club membership, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance.  In addition to the health-care benefits for eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S., as announced in January 2018, we expanded maternity leave and implemented a new paid parental leave program to all full-time associates.  We also introduced a $5,000 benefit to assist eligible associates with adoption.

Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., we provide a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.
