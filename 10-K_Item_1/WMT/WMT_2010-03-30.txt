We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.

The Development of Our Company

Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L.
Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers,
Arkansas. In fiscal 1984, we opened our first three Sam’s Clubs, and in fiscal 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In fiscal 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In fiscal 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we owned a 50% interest
along with Cifra S.A. de C.V. (“Cifra”). In fiscal 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in Cifra, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Since fiscal 1992, our international
presence has continued to expand. At January 31, 2010, our International segment was comprised of our wholly-owned subsidiaries operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, our majority-owned subsidiaries
operating in five countries in Central America, and in Chile and Mexico, our joint ventures in India and China and our other controlled subsidiaries in China.

As of the end of fiscal 2010, we operated 803 discount stores, 2,747 supercenters, 158 Neighborhood Markets and 596 Sam’s Clubs in the United States. Our International segment operated units in
Argentina (43), Brazil (434), Canada (317), Chile (252), Costa Rica (170), El Salvador (77), Guatemala (164), Honduras (53), India (1), Japan (371), Mexico (1,469), Nicaragua (55), Puerto Rico (56) and the United Kingdom (371) at the end
of fiscal 2010. We also operated 279 stores in China through a combination of joint ventures and other controlled subsidiaries at the end of fiscal 2010. As of the end of fiscal 2010, our Indian business consisted of wholesale cash-and-carry and
back-end supply chain management operations through our joint venture with Bharti Enterprises and technical support to the retail stores of Bharti Retail through a franchise agreement.






Our Business Segments

The company is engaged in the operations of retail stores located in all 50 states of the United States, our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Puerto Rico and the United
Kingdom, our majority-owned subsidiaries in Central America, Chile and Mexico and our joint ventures in India and China and our other controlled subsidiaries in China. The company defines our segments as those business units whose operating results
our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.

The
Walmart U.S. segment includes the company’s mass merchant concept in the United States operating under the “Walmart” or “Wal-Mart” brand, as well as walmart.com. The International segment consists of the company’s
operations outside of the 50 United States. The Sam’s Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States, as well as samsclub.com.

The company measures the results of its segments using each segment’s operating income which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From time to time, we revise the measurement of each
segment’s operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When we do so, the segment operating income for each segment affected by the revisions is restated for all
periods presented to maintain comparability.

Walmart U.S. Segment

The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $258.2 billion, $255.3 billion and $238.9 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single discount store, supercenter or Neighborhood Market location accounted for as much as 1% of total company net sales.

Operations.Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters and an increasing number of
discount stores and Neighborhood Markets are 24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining supercenters, discount stores and Neighborhood Markets vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., seven days a week. We
accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards, EBT cards, a private-label store credit card issued by a third-party provider and online payments through PayPal. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept
payments for products and services through our customers’ health benefit plans.

Seasonal Aspects of
Operations.The Walmart U.S. segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during the
first fiscal quarter.

Competition.Our supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, hypermarts,
discount stores, supermarkets, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. Our discount stores and Neighborhood Markets compete with other discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores
and supermarkets, many of which are national or regional chains. We also compete with internet-based retailers and catalog businesses and with other retailers for new store sites.

Our ability to develop the right locations and offer value and service to our customers largely determines our competitive position within
the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:



•EDLP – our commitment to price leadership and our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust
that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;






•Rollbacks – our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;



•Store of the Community – a program to ensure that the merchandise assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of the local
community in which that store is located;



•Clean, Fast and Friendly – our commitment to deliver a great customer experience through fast, friendly service in a clean environment;



•Win, Play and Show – a strategy to select a merchandise assortment based on our growth potential, economies of scale and customer credibility in
each business;



•Save Even More – a strategy to meet or be below a competitor’s advertised price on key value items; and



•Project Impact – a program to clarify merchandise offerings, improve customer experience, and increase productivity.

We offer a broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that provide confidence to our customers that
we will have what they need and operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience. We believe these factors provide us with additional competitive advantages.

Distribution.During fiscal 2010, approximately 79% of the Walmart U.S. segment’s purchases of merchandise were shipped
to the segment’s stores through our distribution centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly to stores from suppliers. General merchandise is transported to stores primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we
contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry grocery merchandise.

Our Walmart U.S.
segment operations are supported by 120 distribution facilities as of January 31, 2010, located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 120 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 105. Third parties owned and
operated the remaining 15 distribution facilities. During fiscal 2010, the company opened a third-party return center and dot com facility; one owned return center and two third-party facilities were closed. In addition to servicing the Walmart U.S.
segment, some of our Walmart distribution centers also service our Sam’s Club segment for certain items.

billion, $98.8 billion and $90.6 billion, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as much as 1% of total company net sales.

subsidiaries operating in five countries in Central America, and in Chile and Mexico, our joint ventures in India and China and our other controlled subsidiaries in China.

Merchandise.The merchandising strategy for the International segment is similar to that of our operations in the United
States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not found in the United States have been developed to serve customers in the different
markets in which the International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations.The hours of operation for operating units in the International segment vary by country and by individual markets
within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards and private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers. Other
consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

Across the
International segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. In addition, relationships with key global suppliers continue to help us leverage our volumes across countries.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The International segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, a
large volume of sales occur in our fourth fiscal quarter. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

Competition.The International segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the supermarket,
discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate. We also operate local, national and
international restaurant chains in Mexico, and consumer finance operations in Chile and in Mexico. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the International segment determines, to a large
extent, our competitive position. In our international units, our ability to operate the food departments effectively has a major impact on the segment’s competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution.We utilize a total of 132 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa
Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and the United Kingdom, including two export






consolidation facilities in the United States. Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the International segment. During
fiscal 2010, approximately 83% of the International segment’s purchases flowed through these distribution facilities. Suppliers ship the balance of the International segment’s purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in
which we operate. Of these 132 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 34 and leased and operated 37. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 61 distribution facilities.

Sam’s Club Segment

The Sam’s Club segment had net sales of $46.7
billion, $46.9 billion and $44.3 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total company net sales.

General.As a membership club warehouse, we operate Sam’s Clubs in 48 states. Facility sizes for Sam’s Clubs
generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 133,000 square feet. Sam’s Club also provides its members with a broad assortment of merchandise and services online atwww.samsclub.com.

through Saturday, starting at 7:00 a.m.

Sam’s Clubs are membership-only operations. A variety of payment methods are
accepted at our clubs, including debit cards, certain types of credit cards, and a private label and co-branded Discover credit cards issued by a third-party provider. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products
and services through our customers’ health benefit plans.

Members include both business owners and individual consumers.
Individual consumers are referred to as Advantage members. The annual membership fee for an individual Advantage member is $40 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee
for business members is $35 for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, business members can add up to eight business associates to their business account for $35 each. Sam’s Club
PLUS is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services. The annual fee for a Primary PLUS member (Business or Advantage) is $100. In addition, Business Plus primary members can add up to 16 business associates to their
business membership for $35 each.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The Sam’s Club segment’s business
is seasonal to a certain extent. Generally, its highest volume of sales occurs in the fourth fiscal quarter, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest volume occurs during the first fiscal quarter.

Competition.Sam’s Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale
grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Sam’s Club competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality
merchandise to meet the needs of our members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

Distribution.During fiscal 2010, approximately 63% of the Sam’s Club segment non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam’s Club segment’s dedicated distribution facilities and some of the Walmart U.S.
segment’s distribution centers for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam’s Club purchases directly to Sam’s Club locations. As of January 31, 2010, our Sam’s Club segment operations were supported by 26
distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 26 distribution facilities, we owned and operated eight. Third parties owned and operated the remaining 18 distribution facilities.

The principal focus of our Sam’s Club’s distribution operations is on crossdocking merchandise, while stored inventory is
minimized. Crossdocking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a crossdock facility, sometimes less than an hour.

Sam’s Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers to transport non-perishable merchandise from
distribution centers to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs.
