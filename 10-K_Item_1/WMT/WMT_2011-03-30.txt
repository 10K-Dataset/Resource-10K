We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.

The Development of Our Company

Although
Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas. In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a
similar store in Versailles, Missouri. Until 1962, our founders’ business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas. In 1984,
we opened our first three Sam’s Clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter. In 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico, in which we owned a 50% interest along with Cifra
S.A. de C.V. (“Cifra”). In 1998, we acquired the controlling interest in Cifra, and in February 2000, Cifra officially changed its name to Wal-Mart de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Since 1992, our international presence has continued to expand. At
January 31, 2011, our Walmart International segment conducted retail business in 14 countries.






Our Business Segments

The Company is engaged in the operation of retail stores located in all 50 states of the United States and Puerto Rico; its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan and the United
Kingdom; its majority-owned subsidiaries in Chile, Mexico and five countries in Central America; and its joint ventures in India and China and other controlled subsidiaries in China. The Company defines its segments as those business units whose
operating results the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.

The
Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company’s mass merchant concept in the United States and Puerto Rico operating under the “Walmart” or “Wal-Mart” brand, as well as walmart.com. The Walmart International segment consists of
the Company’s operations outside of the 50 United States and Puerto Rico. The Sam’s Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the United States and Puerto Rico, as well as samsclub.com.

The Company measures the results of its segments using each segment’s operating income which includes certain corporate overhead allocations. From
time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment’s operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM. When we do so, the segment operating income for each
segment affected by the revision is restated for all periods presented to maintain comparability.

Walmart U.S. Segment

The Walmart U.S. segment had net sales of $260.3 billion, $259.9 billion and $257.0 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single supercenter, discount store, Neighborhood Market or other small format location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales.

Operations.Hours of operation for nearly all supercenters and an increasing number of discount stores and
Neighborhood Markets are 24 hours each day. Hours of operation for the remaining supercenters, discount stores and Neighborhood Markets and other small formats vary by location, but are generally 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., seven days a week.

payments for products and services through our customers’ health benefit plans.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The
Walmart U.S. segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events, national and religious holidays, as well as different climatic conditions. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income
occur in the fiscal quarter ending January 31, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest sales volume and segment operating income occur during the fiscal quarter ending April 30.

Competition.Our supercenters compete with other supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, discount stores, supermarkets, department, drug,
variety and specialty stores, many of which are national or regional chains. Our discount stores and Neighborhood Markets and other small formats compete with other supercenter-type, discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores and
supermarkets, many of which are national or regional chains. We also compete with internet-based retailers and catalog businesses and with other retailers for new store sites.






Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and offer value and service to our
customers largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry. We employ many programs designed to meet competitive pressures within our industry. These programs include the following:



•EDLP – our commitment to price leadership and our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust
that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity;



•Rollbacks – our commitment to continually pass cost savings on to the customer by lowering prices on selected goods;



•Save Even More – a strategy to meet or be below a competitor’s advertised price on key value items;



•Store of the Community – a program to ensure the merchandise assortment in a particular store fits the demographic needs of the local community in
which that store is located; and



•Clean, Fast and Friendly – our commitment to deliver a great customer experience through fast, friendly service in a clean environment.

We offer a broad assortment of merchandise that provides one-stop shopping, in-stock levels that give our customers
confidence that we will have the products they need and operating hours that allow customers to shop at their convenience.

Distribution.During fiscal 2011, approximately 78% of the Walmart U.S. segment’s purchases of merchandise were shipped to the
segment’s stores through our distribution centers. The balance of merchandise purchased was shipped directly to stores from suppliers. General merchandise is transported to stores primarily through our private truck fleet. However, we contract
with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable and dry grocery merchandise.

Our Walmart U.S. segment operations are
supported by 123 distribution facilities as of January 31, 2011, located strategically throughout the continental United States and Puerto Rico. Of these 123 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 105. Third parties owned and operated
the remaining 18 distribution facilities. In addition to servicing the Walmart U.S. segment, some of our Walmart distribution centers also service our Sam’s Club segment for certain items.

Walmart International Segment

The
Walmart International segment’s net sales for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, were $109.2 billion, $97.4 billion and $96.1 billion, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single unit accounted for as
much as 1% of total Company net sales.

General.Our Walmart International segment is comprised of our wholly-owned subsidiaries
operating in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Japan, and the United Kingdom; our majority-owned subsidiaries operating in Chile, Mexico and five countries in Central America; our joint ventures in India and China and our other controlled subsidiaries in
China. Walmart International operates units under approximately 60 different banners in numerous different formats, including discount stores, supermarkets, supercenters, hypermarkets, restaurants and, in Mexico, apparel stores. In addition, in

U.S. and Sam’s Club segments. Total Walmart International unit count and retail square feet data presented in the table above excludes Puerto Rico.

Merchandise.The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our
operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale. While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the U.S. stores and clubs have been
developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the Walmart International segment operates. In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality
merchandise.






Operations.The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment
vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. We accept a variety of payment methods including credit cards, debit cards and private-label store credit cards
issued by third-party providers and in Chile, Canada and Mexico, credit cards issued by our subsidiaries. Other consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.

Across the Walmart International segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices. In
addition, relationships with key global suppliers continue to help us leverage our volumes across countries.

Seasonal Aspects of
Operations.The Walmart International segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent. Historically, the highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in our fiscal quarter ending January 31 and the lowest sales volume
and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending April 30. The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climatic conditions.

Competition.The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and international chains in the
supermarket, discount, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarts, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate. We also operate local,
national and international restaurant chains in Mexico, and consumer finance operations in Canada, Chile and Mexico. Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise that offers exceptional value in the Walmart International
segment determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which Walmart International operates. In our international units, our ability to operate the food departments effectively has a major impact on the segment’s
competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution.We utilize a total of 134 distribution facilities located
in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua and the United Kingdom, including two export consolidation facilities in the United States. Through these facilities, we process and
distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment. During fiscal 2011, approximately 77% of the Walmart International segment’s purchases flowed through these distribution facilities.
Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment’s purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate. Of these 134 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 34 and leased and operated 38. Third
parties owned and operated the remaining 62 distribution facilities.

Sam’s Club Segment

The Sam’s Club segment had net sales of $49.5 billion, $47.8 billion and $48.0 billion for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. During the most recent fiscal year, no single club location accounted for as much as 1% of total Company net sales.

General.As a membership club warehouse, we operate Sam’s Clubs in 48 states and Puerto Rico. Facility sizes for Sam’s Clubs
generally range between 71,000 and 190,000 square feet, with an average size of approximately 133,000 square feet. Sam’s Club also provides its members with a broad assortment of merchandise and services online atwww.samsclub.com.

Operations.Operating hours for Sam’s Clubs are Monday through Friday from 10:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m.,
Saturday from 9:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. and Sunday from 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Additionally, all club locations offer a Gold Key program that permits Business Members and Plus Members to shop before the regular operating hours Monday through Saturday,
starting at 7:00 a.m.

Sam’s Clubs are membership-only operations. A variety of payment methods are accepted at our clubs, including
debit cards, certain types of credit cards, and private label and co-branded Discover credit cards issued by a third-party provider. In addition, our pharmacy and optical departments accept payments for products and services through our
members’ health benefit plans.

Members include both business owners and individual consumers. Individual consumers are referred to as
Advantage Members. The annual membership fee for an individual Advantage Member is $40 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. The annual membership fee for Business
Members is $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) for the primary membership card, with a spouse/household card available at no additional cost. In addition, Business Members can add up to eight business associates to their business account for $35 (plus
taxes, if applicable) each. Sam’s Club Plus is a premium membership program that offers additional benefits and services to both Business and Advantage Club Members. The annual fee for a Primary Plus Member (Business or Advantage) is $100 (plus
taxes, if applicable). In addition, Business Plus Primary Members can add up to sixteen business associates to their business membership for $35 (plus taxes, if applicable) each.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The Sam’s Club segment’s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events, national and religious holidays, as well as
different climatic conditions. Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending January 31, which includes the holiday season, and the lowest sales volume and segment operating income occur
during the fiscal quarter ending April 30.






Competition.Sam’s Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount
retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses. Sam’s Club competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club
sites. Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise and food to meet the needs of our members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

Distribution.During fiscal 2011, approximately 63% of the Sam’s Club segment’s non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam’s Club segment’s dedicated distribution
facilities and some of the Walmart U.S. segment’s distribution centers for certain items. Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam’s Club segment’s purchases directly to Sam’s Club locations. As of January 31, 2011, our
Sam’s Club segment operations were supported by 25 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States. Of these 25 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 8. Third parties owned and operated the
remaining 17 distribution facilities.

The principal focus of our Sam’s Club’s distribution operations is on cross-docking
merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized. Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers. Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility,
sometimes less than an hour.

Sam’s Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers to transport
non-perishable merchandise from distribution centers to clubs. We contract with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution centers to clubs.

the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately 2.1 million employees (“associates”) worldwide, with approximately 1.4 million associates in the United States and 0.7 million associates internationally. Similar to
other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt employees and experiences significant turnover in employees each year.

The Company maintains separate Profit Sharing and 401(k) Plans for associates in the United States and Puerto Rico. Associates generally become participants following one year of employment. Through
fiscal 2011, the Profit Sharing component of the plan was entirely funded by the Company and the Company made an additional contribution to the associates’ 401(k) component of the plan. In addition to the Company’s contributions,
associates could elect to contribute a percentage of their earnings to the 401(k) component of the plan.

Beginning in fiscal 2012, the
Company will offer a safe harbor 401(k) plan to all eligible United States associates. The Company will match 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings. The Company will offer the same matching contribution to all
eligible Puerto Rico associates. The matching contributions will immediately vest at 100% for each associate. Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pretax earnings, but not more than the statutory limits. Participants age 50 or older may
defer additional earnings in catch-up contributions up to the maximum statutory limits.

In addition, in the United States, the Company offers
a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or Sam’s Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases in the Associate Stock Purchase Program, and life
insurance. The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates. The Company’s medical plan has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses.

In our operations outside the United States, the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.
