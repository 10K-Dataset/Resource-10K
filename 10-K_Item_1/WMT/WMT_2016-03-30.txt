Our strategy is to lead on price, differentiate on access, be competitive on assortment and deliver a great experience.  Leading on price is designed to earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and services at everyday low prices ("EDLP").  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every day so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Price leadership is core to who we are.  Everyday low cost ("EDLC") is our commitment to control expenses so those cost savings can be passed along to our customers.  Our digital and physical presence provides customers access to our broad assortment anytime and anywhere.  We strive to give our customers and members a great digital and physical shopping experience.

Our operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Our fiscal year ends on January 31 for our United States ("U.S.") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a one-month lag and on a calendar basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years endedJanuary 31, 2016("fiscal2016"),January 31, 2015("fiscal2015") andJanuary 31, 2014("fiscal2014").  During fiscal2016, we generated total revenues of$482.1 billion, which was primarily comprised of net sales of$478.6 billion.

We maintain our principal offices at 702 S.W. 8th Street, Bentonville, Arkansas 72716, USA.  Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "WMT."

The Development of Our Company

Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas.  In 1983, we opened our first Sam's Club, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  In 1998, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In 1991, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico.  Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and, as ofJanuary 31, 2016, our Walmart International segment conducted business in 27 countries.

In 2000, we began our first digital initiative by creating the walmart.com retail website.  Since then, our digital presence has continued to grow.  As ofJanuary 31, 2016, we operated e-commerce websites in 11 countries, providing access to Walmart and our various brands around the world.










Information About Our Segments

The Company is engaged in the operation of retail, wholesale and other units located throughout the U.S., Africa, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico and the United Kingdom.  The Company's operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products and services in each of its segments.  It is impractical to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products and services.

Walmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates retail stores in all 50 states in the U.S., Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico, with three primary store formats, as well as digital retail.  Walmart U.S. generated approximately62%of our net sales in fiscal2016, and of our three segments, Walmart U.S. is the largest and has historically had the highest gross profit as a percentage of net sales ("gross profit rate").  In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the Company's net sales and operating income.

Walmart International consists of operations in 27 countries outside of the U.S. and includes numerous formats divided into three major categories: retail, wholesale and other.  These categories consist of numerous formats, including supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs, including Sam's Clubs, cash & carry, home improvement, specialty electronics, apparel stores, drug stores and convenience stores, as well as digital retail.  Walmart International generated approximately26%of our fiscal2016net sales.  The overall gross profit rate for Walmart International is lower than that of Walmart U.S. primarily because of its merchandise mix.  Walmart International is our second largest segment and has grown through acquisitions, as well as by adding retail, wholesale and other units.

Sam's Club consists of membership-only warehouse clubs and operates in 48 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico, as well as digital retail.  Sam's Club accounted for approximately12%of our fiscal2016net sales.  As a membership-only warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  As a result, Sam's Club operates with a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.

The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's net sales and operating income, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM.  When the measurement of a segment changes, previous period amounts and balances are reclassified to be comparable to the current period's presentation.

Digital.The Walmart International segment operates e-commerce websites in 10 countries (Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom).  Customers have access through our e-commerce websites and, in countries where available, mobile commerce applications to a broad assortment of merchandise and services, both of which vary by country.  Digital retail supports our physical stores with capabilities like "Click & Collect" in the United Kingdom and our grocery home delivery business in Mexico.

Merchandise.The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we have both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, lower priced items.  Along with the private brands we market globally, such as "Equate," "George," "Great Value," "Holiday Time," "Hometrends," "Mainstays," "Ol' Roy" and "Parent's Choice," our international markets have developed market specific brands including "Aurrera," "Cambridge," "Chosen by You," "Extra Special" and "Smart Price."  In addition, we have developed relationships with regional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at low prices.

Operations.The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation.  Each country accepts a variety of payment methods.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income have occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.

Competition.The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, home improvement, specialty electronic, e-commerce and catalog businesses in each of the markets in which we operate.  We also operate, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations.  We compete with others for desirable sites.  Our ability to develop, open and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates digital and physical shopping determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the markets in which Walmart International operates.  We believe price leadership is a critical part of our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach.  Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.  In the markets in which we have retail websites or retail websites and mobile commerce applications, those websites and applications help differentiate us from our competitors and help us compete with other retailers for customers and their purchases, both in the digital and the physical retail operations.










Distribution.We utilize a total of176distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment.

The principal focus of Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized.  Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers.  Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour.

Sam's Club uses a combination of a private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport non-perishable merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.  The segment contracts with common carriers to transport perishable grocery merchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.

Sam's Club ships merchandise purchased by members on its retail website and through its mobile commerce applications by a number of methods from its e-commerce dedicated fulfillment center and other distribution centers.














Other Segment Information

Certain financial information relating to our segments is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders for the fiscal year ended January 31,2016("Annual Report to Shareholders") under the caption "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and in Note 14 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.  Note 14 also includes information regarding total revenues and long-lived assets aggregated by our U.S. and non-U.S. operations.  Such portions of the Annual Report to Shareholders are included as Exhibit 13 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K and incorporated by reference herein as expressly provided herein.

Suppliers and Supply Chain

As a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes over 100,000 suppliers located around the world, including in the United States, from whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores and clubs.  In many instances, we purchase merchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in the "fresh" category.  Our purchases may represent a significant percentage of a number of our suppliers' annual sales, and the volume of product we acquire from many suppliers allows us to obtain favorable pricing from such suppliers.  Our suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker safety laws and other applicable laws.  Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish to offer to our customer, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those products to our stores and clubs determines, in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer to our customers and members.

Employees

As of the end of fiscal2016, the Company and its subsidiaries employed approximately2.3 millionemployees ("associates") worldwide, with nearly1.5 millionassociates in the U.S. and0.8 millionassociates internationally.  Similar to other retailers, the Company has a large number of part-time, hourly or non-exempt associates and a large number of associates turn over each year.  We believe our relationships with our associates are good.

On February 19, 2015, the Company announced a significant initiative on pay and training for U.S. associates.  Approximately 500,000 full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay raises in the first half of fiscal 2016 and in February 2016, approximately 1.2 million full-time and part-time associates at Walmart U.S. stores and Sam's Clubs received pay increases.  Also included in the announcement were comprehensive changes to our hiring, training, compensation and scheduling programs, as well as to our store management structure.  These changes will give our U.S. associates the opportunity to earn higher pay and advance in their careers.

Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to our associates is included in our Annual Report to Shareholders in Note 12 in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" included therein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.

In addition to retirement-related benefits, in the U.S., the Company offers a broad range of Company-paid benefits to our associates, including store discount cards or Sam's Club memberships, bonuses based on Company performance, matching a portion of purchases of our stock by associates through our Associate Stock Purchase Plan and life insurance.  The Company also offers health-care benefits to eligible full-time and part-time associates in the U.S.  The Company's medical plan in the U.S. has no lifetime maximum benefit for most expenses.

Similarly, in the operations outside the U.S., the Company provides a variety of associate benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory requirements.
