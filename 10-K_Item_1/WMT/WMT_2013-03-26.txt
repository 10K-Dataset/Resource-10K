The Development of Our Company

Although Walmart was incorporated in Delaware in October 1969, the businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store in Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our founders' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores.  In that year, the first Wal-Mart Discount City, which was a discount store, opened in Rogers, Arkansas.  In 1984, we opened our first three Sam's Clubs, and in 1988, we opened our first supercenter.  In 1999, we opened our first Neighborhood Market.

In 1992, we began our first international initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico.  Since then, our international presence has continued to expand and at January 31,2013, our Walmart International segment conducted retail business in 26 countries.

Our Business Segments

The Company is engaged in the operation of retail stores located throughout the U.S.; its wholly-owned subsidiaries in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, China, Japan and the United Kingdom; its majority-owned subsidiaries in Africa, Central America, Chile, China and Mexico; its joint ventures in India and China; and other controlled subsidiaries in China.  The Company defines its reportable segments as those business units whose operating results the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.

The Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company's mass merchant concept in the U.S., operating under the "Walmart" or "Wal-Mart" brand, as well as walmart.com.  The Walmart International segment consists of the Company's operations outside of the U.S., including various retail websites.  The Sam's Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as samsclub.com.

The Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment's operating income, which we calculate by including certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment's operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as dictated by the information regularly reviewed by our CODM.  When we do so, the prior period amounts for segment operating income are reclassified to conform to the current period's presentation.

Merchandise.The merchandising strategy for the Walmart International segment is similar to that of our operations in the United States in terms of the breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of sales, numerous store brands not offered for sale in the U.S. stores and clubs have been developed to serve customers in the different markets in which the Walmart International segment operates.  In addition, steps have been taken to develop relationships with local suppliers in each country to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise.

Operations.The hours of operation for operating units in the Walmart International segment vary by country and by individual markets within countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation.  We accept a variety of payment methods including cash, check, debit and credit cards, private-label store credit cards issued by third-party providers, and in Canada, Chile and Mexico, credit cards issued by our subsidiaries.  Limited consumer finance programs exist in certain markets to facilitate the purchase of goods by the customer.  Across the Walmart International segment, we are leveraging best practices, lessons from multiple store formats and global sourcing practices.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The Walmart International segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, the segment's highest sales volume and operating income occur in our fiscal quarter ending January 31.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different national and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different climates.

Competition.The Walmart International segment competes with a variety of local, national and global chains in the supermarket, discount, grocery, department, drug, variety and specialty stores, supercenter-type stores, hypermarkets, wholesale clubs, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses in each of the countries in which we operate.  We also operate restaurant chains and, on a limited basis, consumer finance operations.  We compete with others for desirable sites for new retail units.  Our ability to offer our customers low prices on quality merchandise determines, to a large extent, our competitive position in the countries in which Walmart International operates.  EDLP is the right business model for our customers and for all of our markets, including high-growth or emerging markets.  We are in the midst of a multi-year plan to transition all of our markets to EDLP.  Additionally, our ability to operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.

Distribution.We utilize a total of 160 distribution facilities located in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Japan, Mexico, South Africa and the United Kingdom, including one export consolidation facility in the U.S.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating units of the Walmart International segment.  During fiscal2013, approximately 82% of the Walmart International segment's purchases passed through these distribution facilities.  Suppliers ship the balance of the Walmart International segment's purchases directly to our stores in the various countries in which we operate.  Of these 160 distribution facilities, we owned and operated 41, we owned and third parties operated 11, and we leased and operated 67.  Third parties leased and operated the remaining 41 distribution facilities.

Seasonal Aspects of Operations.The Sam's Club segment's business is seasonal to a certain extent due to different calendar events, national and religious holidays, as well as different climates.  Historically, its highest sales volume and segment operating income occur in the fiscal quarter ending January 31.

Competition.Sam's Club competes with other warehouse clubs, as well as with discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations, internet-based retailers and catalog businesses.  Sam's Club also competes with other retailers and warehouse clubs for desirable new club sites.  Our ability to offer low prices and quality merchandise and food products to meet the needs of our members largely determines our competitive position in the warehouse club industry.

Distribution.During fiscal2013, approximately 64% of the Sam's Club segment's non-fuel purchases were shipped from the Sam's Club segment's dedicated distribution facilities or from some of the Walmart U.S. segment's distribution facilities.  Suppliers shipped the balance of the Sam's Club segment's purchases directly to Sam's Club locations.  As of January 31,2013, our Sam's Club segment operations were supported by 25 distribution facilities located strategically throughout the continental United States.  Of these 25 distribution facilities, we owned and operated eight.  We owned and a third party operated two facilities.  Third parties owned and operated the remaining 15 distribution facilities.  Additionally, some of the Walmart U.S. distribution facilities also service our Sam's Club segment for certain items.

The principal focus of our Sam's Club's distribution operations is on cross-docking merchandise, while stored inventory is minimized.  Cross-docking is a distribution process under which shipments are directly transferred from inbound to outbound trailers.  Shipments typically spend less than 24 hours in a cross-dock facility, and sometimes less than an hour.
