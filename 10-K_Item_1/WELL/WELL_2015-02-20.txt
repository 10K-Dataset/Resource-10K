Item 1.Business



General



Health
Care REIT, Inc. is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that has been at the
forefront of seniors housing and health care real estate since the company was
founded in 1970.  We are an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio. Our
portfolio spans the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real
estate, including seniors housing communities, long-term/post-acute care facilities,
medical office buildings, inpatient and outpatient medical centers and life
science facilities. Our capital programs, when combined with comprehensive
planning, development and property management services, make us a single-source
solution for acquiring, planning, developing, managing, repositioning and
monetizing real estate assets.  More information is available on the Internet at
www.hcreit.com.  The information on our website is not incorporated by
reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included
as an inactive textual reference only.



Our
primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder
value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create
opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of
annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these
objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health
care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type,
customer and geographic location.



Depending
upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is
sufficient to fund operations, meet debt service obligations (both principal
and interest), make dividend distributions and complete construction projects
in process. We also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future
investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings
under our primary unsecured credit facility, internally generated cash and the
proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from net
operating income and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent
financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our primary
unsecured credit facility, has historically been provided through a combination
of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or
assumption of secured debt.

Portfolio of Properties



Please
see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operation – Executive Summary – Company Overview” for a table that
summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2014.



Property Types



We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate and
evaluate our business on three reportable segments: seniors housing triple-net,
seniors housing operating and medical facilities.For
additional information regarding our segments, please see Note 17 to our
consolidated financial statements.The accounting
policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of
significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial
statements.The following is a summary of our various property types.



Seniors
Housing Triple-Net



Our
seniors housing triple-net properties include independent living facilities,
independent supportive living facilities (Canada), continuing care retirement
communities, assisted living facilities, care homes with and without nursing, Alzheimer’s/dementia
facilities, long-term/post-acute care facilities, hospitals and combinations
thereof. We invest primarily through acquisitions, development and joint venture
partnerships. Our properties are primarily leased to operators under long-term,
triple-net master leases. We are not involved in property management.  Our
properties include stand-alone facilities that provide one level of service,
combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service, and communities
or campuses that provide a wide range of services.



Independent
Living Facilities and Independent Supportive Living Facilities (Canada).Independent
living facilities and independent supportive living facilities are
age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining facilities that
provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping,
linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities.



Continuing
Care Retirement Communities.Continuing care
retirement communities typically include a combination of detached homes, an
independent living facility, an assisted living facility and/or a
long-term/post-acute care facility on one campus. These communities appeal to
residents because there is no need to relocate when health and medical needs
change. Resident payment plans









vary, but can include
entrance fees, condominium fees and rental fees. Many of these communities also
charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some
health services.



Assisted
Living Facilities.  Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental
properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but
also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require
assistance with activities of daily living, including, but not limited to, management
of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating.



Care
Homes with Nursing (United Kingdom).  Care homes with nursing,
regulated by the Care Quality Commission are licensed daily rate or rental
properties where the majority of individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or
medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for various federal and
local reimbursement programs.  Unlike the U.S., care homes with nursing in the
U.K. generally do not provide post-acute care.



Care
Homes (United Kingdom).  Care homes, regulated by the Care
Quality Commission, are rental properties that provide essentially the same
services as U.S. assisted living facilities.



Alzheimer’s/Dementia
Care Facilities.Certain assisted living facilities may include
state-licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with
Alzheimer’s disease and/or other types of dementia.



Long-Term/Post-Acute
Care Facilities.  Our long-term/post-acute care facilities generally include
skilled nursing/post-acute care facilities, inpatient rehabilitation facilities
and long-term acute care facilities.  Skilled nursing/post-acute care facilities
are licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals
require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are
licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement in the United States or
provincial reimbursement in Canada.  All facilities offer some level of
rehabilitation services.  Some facilities focus on higher acuity patients and offer
rehabilitation units specializing in cardiac, orthopedic, dialysis,
neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation.  Inpatient rehabilitation facilities
provide inpatient services for patients with intensive rehabilitation needs.  Long-term
acute care facilities provide inpatient services for patients with complex
medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency
support than is available in most skilled nursing/post-acute care facilities.



Hospitals. 
Hospitals are acute care facilities that provide a wide range of inpatient and
outpatient services, including, but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation,
therapy and clinical laboratories.



Our seniors housing
triple-net segment accounted for 31%, 31% and 46% of total revenues (including
discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.  We lease 181 facilities to Genesis Healthcare, LLC, an operator
of long-term/post-acute care facilities, pursuant to a long-term, triple-net
master lease.  In addition to rent, the master lease requires Genesis to pay
all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, building repairs,
maintenance costs and all obligations under the ground leases.  All obligations
under the master lease have been guaranteed by FC-GEN Operations Investment,
LLC.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, our lease with Genesis accounted
for approximately 31% of our seniors housing triple-net segment revenues and 9%
of our total revenues.



Seniors
Housing Operating



Our
seniors housing operating properties include several of the facility types
described in “Item 1 – Business – Property Types – Seniors Housing Triple-Net”,
including independent living facilities and independent supportive living
facilities, assisted living facilities, care homes and Alzheimer’s/dementia
care facilities.



Properties
are primarily held in consolidated joint venture entities with operating
partners. We utilize the structure proposed in the REIT Investment
Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a
“RIDEA” structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code authorizing the
RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act
of 2008).  See Note 18 for more information.



Our seniors housing
operating segment accounted for 57%, 56% and 37% of total revenues (including
discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.  We have relationships with ten operators to own and operate 297 facilities
(plus 55 unconsolidated facilities).  In each instance, our partner provides
management services to the properties pursuant to an incentive-based management
contract.  We rely on our partners to effectively and efficiently manage these
properties.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, our relationship with
Sunrise Senior Living accounted for approximately 47% of our seniors housing
operating segment revenues and 27% of our total revenues.



Medical
Facilities










Our
medical facilities include medical office buildings and life science
facilities.  We typically lease our medical office buildings to multiple
tenants and provide varying levels of property management.  Our life science
investment represents an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture entity
(see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).  Our medical facilities
segment accounted for 12%, 13% and 17% of total revenues (including
discontinued operations) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012,
respectively.  No single tenant exceeds 20% of segment revenues.



Medical
Office Buildings.  The medical office building portfolio consists of health care
related buildings that generally include physician offices, ambulatory surgery
centers, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services and/or labs. Our portfolio
has a strong affiliation with health systems. Approximately 95% of our medical
office building portfolio is affiliated with health systems (with buildings on
hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the health system and
their physicians).



Life
Science Facilities.  The life science portfolio consists of laboratory and office facilities
specifically designed and constructed for use by biotechnology and
pharmaceutical companies.  These facilities are located adjacent to The
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is a well-established market known
for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research. They are similar to commercial
office buildings with advanced HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning),
electrical and mechanical systems.



Investments



Depending
upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in
the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate
returns to our stockholders.  We invest in seniors housing and health care real
estate primarily through acquisitions, developments and joint venture
partnerships. For additional information regarding acquisition and development
activity, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.  We
diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic
location. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the
following: (1) the experience of the obligor’s/partner’s management team;
(2) the historical and projected financial and operational performance of
the property; (3) the credit of the obligor/partner; (4) the security
for any lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the building and its
location; (6) the capital committed to the property by the
obligor/partner; and (7) the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry.
We conduct market research and analysis for all potential investments. In
addition, we review the value of all properties, the interest rates and
covenant requirements of any facility-level debt to be assumed at the time of
the acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any existing debt
that is not to be assumed at the time of the acquisition.



We
monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of
property. Our proactive and comprehensive asset management process for seniors
housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements
and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner
creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance
relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other
collateral. Our internal property management division actively manages and
monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process
including review of, among other things, tenant relations, lease expirations,
the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships,
property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions. In
monitoring our portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect
and analyze property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research
to ascertain industry trends.



We evaluate
the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely
trend in operating performance of the facility.  When we identify unacceptable
trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these
efforts, we are generally able to intervene at an early stage to address any
negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue
and the value of our investment.



Investment Types



Real Property.Our
properties are primarily comprised of land, buildings, improvements and related
rights.  Our seniors housing triple-net properties are generally leased to
operators under long-term operating leases.  The leases generally have a fixed
contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15-year
renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase options, a portion
of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full
market value.  Most of our rents are received under triple-net leases requiring
the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation
of the leased property. The tenants are required to repair, rebuild and
maintain the leased properties. Substantially all of these operating leases are
designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental
escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial
lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to
leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the
contractual cash rental payments due for the period.



At
December 31, 2014, approximately 89% of our seniors housing triple-net
properties were subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple
properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement. From time to
time, we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant
under the master lease. The tenant is required to make one monthly payment that
represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease.
Typically, the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the
properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased
properties at the same time. This bundling feature benefits us because the
tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the better performing properties
and terminate the leasing








arrangement with respect to
the poorer performing properties. This spreads our risk among the entire group
of properties within the master lease. The bundling feature should provide a
similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy. Subject to
certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject
each of its leases. It is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be
required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than deciding
on a property by property basis.



Our
medical office building portfolio is primarily self-managed and consists
principally of multi-tenant properties leased to health care providers. Our
leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense
reimbursement by the tenant. As of December 31, 2014, 85% of our portfolio
included leases with full pass through, 13% with a partial expense
reimbursement (modified gross) and 2% with no expense reimbursement (gross).
Our medical office building leases are non-cancellable operating leases that
have a weighted-average remaining term of eight years at December 31, 2014 and
are often credit enhanced by security deposits, guaranties and/or letters of
credit.



Construction.We occasionally
provide for the construction of properties for tenants as part of long-term
operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds
used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is
based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of
interest that approximates our company-wide cost of financing. Our interest
expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. We also typically charge a
transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we defer and amortize
to income over the term of the resulting lease. The construction period commences
upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the
applicable property or the end of a specified period. During the construction
period, we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms
and conditions which require, among other things, periodic site visits by a
Company representative. During the construction period, we generally require an
additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds
and/or completion guaranties. At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding construction
investments of $186,327,000 and were committed to provide additional funds of
approximately $227,618,000 to complete construction for investment properties.



Real Estate Loans.Our
real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income,
principal amortization and transaction fees and are generally secured by
first/second mortgage liens, leasehold mortgages, corporate guaranties and/or
personal guaranties. At December 31, 2014, we had outstanding real estate loans
of $380,169,000.  The interest yield averaged approximately 8.2% per annum on
our outstanding real estate loan balances. Our yield on real estate loans
depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, average
principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate
adjustments. The real estate loans outstanding at December 31, 2014 are
generally subject to one to 15-year terms with principal amortization schedules
and/or balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the
term. Typically, real estate loans are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized
with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the
obligor and its affiliates.





Investments in
Unconsolidated Entities



Principles of Consolidation



The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned
subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights
or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been
eliminated in consolidation.



At
inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities for which control
is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest
entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary
beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where
either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a
controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is
insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional
subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined
to be the primary beneficiary.  Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810,Consolidations,requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining
whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis. This
evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the
activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s economic
performance.










For investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type of rights
held by the limited partner(s), which may preclude consolidation in
circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the
limited partnership. The assessment of limited partners’ rights and their
impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole
general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the
exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole
generalpartner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests, or
(iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding
limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing
members of limited liability companies.



Borrowing Policies



We
utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments. Our debt and
equity levels are determined by management to maintain a conservative credit
profile. Generally, we intend to issue unsecured, fixed-rate public debt with
long-term maturities to approximate the maturities on our triple-net leases and
loans. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit
facility. We replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior
unsecured notes, common stock or preferred stock. When terms are deemed
favorable, we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage
indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged
properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a
leveraged basis. In certain agreements with our lenders, we are subject to
restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness.



Competition



We
compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships,
private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies,
finance/investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and
tax-exempt bond funds, health care operators, developers and other investors in
the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of health care and seniors
housing properties. We compete for investments based on a number of factors
including relationships, certainty of execution, investment structures and
underwriting criteria. Our ability to successfully compete is impacted by
economic and demographic trends, availability of acceptable investment
opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms,
availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and
applicable laws and regulations.



The
operators/tenants of our properties compete with properties that provide
comparable services in the local markets. Operators/tenants compete for
patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care,
reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered,
family preferences, physicians, staff and price. We also face competition from
other health care facilities for tenants, such as physicians and other health
care providers that provide comparable facilities and services.

Health Care Industry



The
demand for health care services, and consequently health care properties, is
projected to reach unprecedented levels in the near future. The Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) projects that national health
expenditures will rise to approximately $3.4 trillion in 2016 or 17.7% of gross
domestic product (“GDP”). The average annual growth in national health
expenditures for 2013 through 2023 is expected to be 5.7%.



While demographics are
the primary driver of demand, economic conditions and availability of services
contribute to health care service utilization rates. We believe the health care
property market may be less susceptible to fluctuations and economic downturns
relative to other property sectors. Investor interest in the market remains
strong, especially in specific sectors such as private-pay senior living and
medical office buildings.



The total U.S.
population is projected to increase by 13.4% through 2033. The elderly
population aged 65 and over is projected to increase by 68.3% through 2033. The
elderly are an important component of health care utilization, especially
independent living services, assisted living services, long-term/post-acute
care services, inpatient and outpatient hospital services and physician
ambulatory care. Most health care services are provided within a health care
facility such as a hospital, a physician’s office or a seniors housing
community. Therefore, we believe there will be continued demand for companies,
such as ours, with expertise in health care real estate.










Health
care real estate investment opportunities tend to increase as demand for health
care services increases.  We recognize the need for health care real estate as
it correlates to health care service demand.  Health care providers require
real estate to house their businesses and expand their services.  We believe
that investment opportunities in health care real estate will continue to be
present due to:

·The specialized nature of the industry, which enhances the credibility
and experience of our company;

·The projected population growth combined with stable or increasing
health care utilization rates, which ensures demand; and

·The on-going merger and acquisition activity.



Certain Government
Regulations



United States



Health
Law Matters — Generally





Licensing
and Certification



The primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities with assisted
living are state licensing and registration laws. In granting and renewing
these licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous factors
relating to a property’s physical plant and operations, including, but not
limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing, and training. A
decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s
record with respect to patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines, and
rules.  Certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us
may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee, a portion of which
may be refundable.  These entrance fee communities are subject to significant state
regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each facility’s
financial condition; establishment and monitoring of reserve requirements, and
other financial restrictions; the right of residents to cancel their contracts
within a specified period of time; lien rights in favor of residents;
restrictions on change of ownership; and similar matters.  Such oversight, and
the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities, may have an
effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such facilities, and,
therefore, may adversely affect us.



Certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and
certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations.  Where applicable, CON laws
generally require, among other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the
need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or expanding an
existing facility, (3) investing in major capital equipment or adding new
services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed
facility, or (5) terminating services that have been previously approved
through the CON process.  Certain state CON laws and regulations may restrict
the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s
size or services. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an
operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a
new operator.  If we have to replace a property operator who is excluded from
participating in a federal or state health care program (as discussed below),
our ability to replace the operator may be affected by a particular state’s CON
laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing changes in provider
control.



With
respect to licensure, generally our long-term/post-acute care facilities and
acute care facilities are required to be licensed and certified for
participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. 
This generally requires license renewals and compliance surveys on an annual or
bi-annual basis. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required
license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to
correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require
those operators to discontinue operations at a property.  In addition, if a
property is found to be out of compliance with Medicare, Medicaid, or other
health care program conditions of participation, the property operator may be
excluded from participating in those government health care programs.  Any such
occurrence may impair an operator’s ability to meet their financial








obligations to us.  If we have to replace an
excluded-property operator, our ability to replace the operator may be affected
by federal and state laws, regulations, and applicable guidance governing
changes in provider control. This may result in payment delays, an inability to
find a replacement operator, a significant working capital commitment from us to
a new operator or other difficulties.



Reimbursement



The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to
evolve.  Federal and state authorities have considered and may seek to
implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively
impact health care property operations.  The impact of any such changes, if
implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio.  No
assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained. 
Accordingly, there can be no assurance that payments under a government health
care program are currently, or will be in the future, sufficient to fully
reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses.  As
a result, an operator’s ability to meet its financial obligations to us could
be adversely impacted.



Seniors Housing Facilities (excluding long-term/post-acute care facilities).Approximately 58% of our overall revenues
(including discontinued operations) for the year ended December 31, 2014 were
attributable to U.S. seniors housing facilities. The majority of the revenues
received by the operators of these facilities are from private pay sources. The
remaining revenue source is primarily Medicaid under certain waiver programs.
As a part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) of 1981, Congress
established a waiver program enabling some states to offer Medicaid
reimbursement to assisted living providers as an alternative to institutional
long-term care services. The provisions of OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of
1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a waiver from typical Medicaid requirements
to develop cost-effective alternatives to long-term care, including Medicaid
payments for assisted living and home health. As of September 30, 2014, 14 of
our 38 seniors housing operators received Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to
Medicaid waiver programs. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2014,
approximately 2% of the revenues at our seniors housing facilities were from
Medicaid reimbursement. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program
operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status.



Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined
by local market conditions and operating costs. Generally, facilities receive a
higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid
beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid
reimbursement varies from state to state.  Thus, the revenues generated by
operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor
mix, acuity level, changes in Medicaid eligibility, and reimbursement levels. 
In addition, a state could lose its Medicaid waiver and no longer be permitted
to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for assisted living services. Changes
in revenues could in turn have a material adverse effect on an operator’s
ability to meet its obligations to us.





Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities



Medicare Reimbursement and Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities.For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2014, approximately 34% of the revenues at
our long-term/post-acute care facilities were paid by Medicare. Generally,
long-term/post-acute care facilities are reimbursed under the Medicare Skilled
Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (“SNF PPS”), the Inpatient
Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System (“IRF PPS”), or the Long
Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (“LTCH PPS”).  There is a risk
under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments, or that
payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services,
which could result in immediate financial difficulties for operators, and could
cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection.



The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency of HHS,
made positive payment updates for the 2015 fiscal year under the SNF PSS, the
IRF PPS and the LTCH PPS.

·On August 5, 2014, CMS issued a
final rule for the SNF PPS. Under the final rule, skilled nursing facilities
(“SNFs”) will receive a net rate increase of 2.0%, accounting for adjustments,
such as the multifactor productivity adjustment. CMS estimates aggregate
payments to SNFs will increase by $750 million in fiscal year 2015.








·On August 6, 2014, CMS issued a
final rule for the IRF PPS. Under the final rule, inpatient rehabilitation
facilities (“IRFs”) will receive a net rate increase of 2.2%, accounting for
adjustments, such as the multifactor productivity adjustment. CMS estimates
aggregate payments to IRFs will increase by $180 million in fiscal year 2015.

·On August 22, 2014, CMS issued a
final rule for the LTCH PPS. Under the final rule, long-term care hospitals
(“LTCHs”) will receive a net rate increase of 0.9%, accounting for adjustments
including, but not limited to, a multifactor productivity adjustment and the
phase-in of a budget neutrality adjustment.  Including other changes, CMS
estimates aggregate payments to LTCHs will increase by $62 million in fiscal
year 2015.





On October 6, 2014, the President signed into law the Improving Medicare
Post-Acute Transformation Act of 2014 (“IMPACT Act”).  The law applies to SNFs,
LTCHs, IRFs and home health agencies and requires providers to report
standardized patient assessment data, data on quality measures, and data on
resource use and other measures.  The law requires public reporting of quality
and resource use and other measures.  MedPAC is required to submit a report to
Congress by June 30, 2016, evaluating and recommending features of a post-acute
payment system that establishes payment rates according to individual
characteristics instead of the post-acute setting where the patient is
treated.  The report must include a technical prototype for a post-acute
prospective payment system and the impact of moving from the current to the new
payment system.



On April 1, 2014, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“Access to
Medicare Act”) was enacted.  The Access to Medicare Act implements value-based
purchasing for SNFs. Beginning in fiscal year 2019, 2% of SNF payments will be
withheld and approximately 50% to 70% of the amount withheld will be paid to
SNFs through value-based payments.  SNFs will begin reporting a readmissions
rate measure by October 1, 2015 and a resource use measure by October 1, 2016. 
Both measures will be publicly available by October 1, 2017.



Medicare Reimbursement and Physicians.CMS annually adjusts the
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule payment rates based on an update formula that
includes application of the Sustainable Growth Rate (“SGR”).  On November 13,
2014, CMS published the calendar year 2015 Physician Fee Schedule final rule,
which called for a negative 21.2% update under the statutory SGR formula.  The
Budget Act and Access to Medicare Act avoided, until March 31, 2015, the
reimbursement cuts that would have occurred.  Congress has overridden the
required reduction every year since 2003.  The final rule continues
implementation of quality and cost measures that will be used in establishing a
new value−based modifier that would adjust physician payments based on
whether they are providing higher quality and more efficient care. The Health
Reform Laws, as defined below, require CMS to begin making payment adjustments
to certain physicians and physician groups on January 1, 2015, and to apply the
modifier to all physicians by January 1, 2017. Calendar year 2013 is the
initial performance year for purposes of adjusting payments in calendar year
2015.



Medicaid Reimbursement and Long-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities.For
the twelve months ended September 30, 2014, approximately 42% of the revenues
of long-term/post-acute care facilities were paid by Medicaid. The federal and
state governments share responsibility for financing Medicaid. The federal
matching rate, known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”),
varies by state based on relative per capita income, but is at least 50% in all
states.  Medicaid is the largest component of total state spending,
representing approximately 25.8% of total state expenditures in state fiscal
year 2014. The percentage of Medicaid dollars for long-term/post-acute care
facilities varies from state to state, due in part to different ratios of
elderly population and eligibility requirements.  Within certain federal guidelines,
states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine eligibility and
reimbursement methodology.  Many states reimburse SNFs, for example, using
fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and
the historical costs incurred in providing patient care.  Reasonable costs
typically include allowances for staffing, administrative and general expenses,
property, and equipment (e.g., real estate taxes, depreciation and fair
rental).










In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse
the cost of providing services.  Certain states are attempting to slow the rate
of Medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. 
Average Medicaid rates for our long-term/post-acute care facilities will likely
vary throughout the year as states continue to make interim changes to their
budgets and Medicaid funding. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement rates may
decline if revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted
expenditures.



Health Reform Laws.



We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future health
care reform legislation or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on
our operators’ or tenants’ property or business. If the operations, cash flows
or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely
impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and
operations may be adversely affected as well.



Other Related Laws





qui
tam

actions, may be filed by almost anyone, including present and former
patients, nurses and other employees. Significantly, if a claim is successfully
adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages up to
$11,000 per claim.










Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions could have a material
adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity, financial condition, and
operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet
its financial obligations to us.  Finally, various state false claim act and anti-kickback
laws may also apply to each property operator.  Violation of any of the
foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or civil penalties that could
have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its
financial obligations to us.



Other legislative developments, including the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly expanded the definition of
health care fraud and related offenses and broadened its scope to include
private health care plans in addition to government payors.  Congress also has
greatly increased funding for the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of
Health and Human Services to audit, investigate and prosecute suspected health
care fraud.  Moreover, a significant portion of the billions in health care
fraud recoveries over the past several years has also been returned to
government agencies to further fund their fraud investigation and prosecution
efforts.





In November 2002, CMS began an ongoing national Nursing Home Quality Initiative
(“NHQI”). Under this initiative, historical survey information, the NHQI Pilot
Evaluation Report and the NHQI Overview is made available to the public on-line.
The NHQI website provides consumer and provider information regarding the
quality of care in nursing homes. The data allows consumers, providers, states,
and researchers to compare quality information that shows how well nursing
homes are caring for their residents’ physical and clinical needs. The posted
nursing home quality measures come from resident assessment data that nursing
homes routinely collect on the residents at specified intervals during their
stay. If the operators of nursing facilities are unable to achieve quality of
care ratings that are comparable or superior to those of their competitors,
they may lose market share to other facilities, reducing their revenues and
adversely impacting their ability to make rental payments.



Finally, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the
health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years
and are expected to continue.  Some of these enforcement actions represent
novel legal theories and expansions in the application of the Federal False
Claims Act.  The costs for an operator of a health care property associated
with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling
these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on
the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us.



United
Kingdom



Registration



In England, care home services are
principally regulated by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (the“Act”) and associated Regulations.The Act requires all persons carrying out “Regulated
Activities” in England, and the managers of such persons, to be registered.
Regulated Activities are defined in the Health and Social Care Act 2008
(Regulated Activities) Regulations 2010, as amended (the “2010 Regulations”),
and include (among other activities):

·The provision of personal care for
persons who, by reason of old age, illness or disability are unable to provide
it for themselves, and which is provided in a place where those persons are
living at the time the care is provided; and








·The provision of residential
accommodation, together with nursing or personal care.



Any person who carries on a regulated
activity without being registered in respect of that activity is guilty of an
offense under the Act. A person guilty of an offense is liable on summary
conviction, to a fine of up to £50,000, or to imprisonment for a term not
exceeding 12 months, or both, and on conviction on indictment, to a fine, or to
imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both.



From April 1, 2015, the 2010 Regulations will be fully
revoked by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (Regulated Activities)
Regulations 2014 (the “2014 Regulations”). While the 2014 Regulations introduce
certain modifications with regard to service standards, the registration
obligations under the Act remain.



Under the Care Quality Commission
(Registration) Regulations 2009, as amended, service providers and managers of
Regulated Activities must provide documentation demonstrating their ability to
provide the relevant service(s); in particular, registrants must be able to
demonstrate that they (or a nominated individual, if the registered person is a
company) possess good character, are physically and mentally fit to carry on
the regulated activity and have the necessary qualifications, skills and
experience to do so.



Service Standards and Notification
Obligations



The 2010 Regulations list the standards
that must be met when providing care services. The service providers’ legal
obligations include:

·Ensuring service users are
protected against receiving care or treatment that is inappropriate or unsafe;

·Assessing and monitoring the
quality of service provision;

·Safeguarding service users from
abuse;

·Ensuring that service users and
others are protected against risks of a healthcare associated infection;

·Protecting service users against
risks in relation to the unsafe use of medicines;

·Meeting the nutritional needs of
service users;

·Ensuring that the premises are
safe and suitable;

·Ensuring that any equipment used
is safe, suitable and readily available when required;

·Respecting and involving service
users;

·Obtaining and acting in accordance
with the consent of service users to care and treatment;

·Having in place an effective
complaints system;

·Maintaining accurate records;

·Operating effective recruitment
procedures; and

·Having sufficient numbers of
suitably qualified, skilled and experienced employees and supporting workers
through training, professional development, supervision, appraisals and
qualifications.



Failure to comply with certain provisions
of the above Regulations is an offense, with a person guilty of the offense
liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £50,000.  Monetary penalty
notices may also be issued.



From April 1, 2015, the 2010 Regulations will be fully
revoked by the 2014 Regulations. The 2014 Regulations aim to streamline the
legal obligations in the 2010 Regulations, and replace them with a set of more
broadly-phrased, legally binding “Fundamental Standards” largely based on
existing obligations in the 2010 Regulations.



While the obligations listed above will continue to
exist in line with the new “Fundamental Standards,” the 2014 Regulations
introduce a number of changes including:



·A new “duty of candour” to notify
and apologize to affected persons, in the event of certain incidents having
actually or potentially led to the death of the service user, where the death
relates directly to the incident rather than to the natural course of the service
user's illness or underlying condition, or severe harm, moderate harm or
prolonged psychological harm to the service user (note that this requirement
came into force on November 27, 2014); and

·More detailed standards to be met
by individuals to be eligible to act as a director of a service provider
institution. For instance, the individual should not have been responsible for,
been privy to, contributed to or facilitated any serious misconduct or
mismanagement (whether unlawful or not) in the course of carrying on a
regulated activity, or equivalent outside of England (note that this
requirement came into force on November 27, 2014).

·The provisions on penalties will
remain similar to the 2010 Regulations although the reference to a fine not
exceeding £50,000 will be removed from April 1, 2015.










Under the Care
Quality Commission (Registration) Regulations 2009 certain matters must be
notified to the Care Quality Commission (the “CQC”), the government regulatory
body overseeing the provision of nursing and other care services in England.
Events that must be notified include (among others):



·Where the service provider or
registered manager proposes to be absent for a continuous period of 28 days or
more;

·A change of the registered person
or where the registered person is a company changes in the name or address of
the registered person, a change of director, secretary or other similar
officer, or a change of the nominated individual;

·The death of a service user;

·Incidents resulting in an injury
(provided certain conditions are met);

·Abuse and allegations of abuse in
relation to a service user; and

·Any event which prevents, or
appears to the service provider to be likely to threaten to prevent, the
service provider’s ability to continue to carry on the regulated activity
safely, or in accordance with the registration requirements.



Failure to comply with the
above notification obligations is an offense and a person guilty of an offense
is liable on summary conviction to a fine of up to £2,500.  The amount of this
fine will be increased to £10,000 by a Statutory Instrument once coming into
force.



Regulatory Oversight and Inspections



The Act also sets out the powers and
responsibilities of the CQC. Among other powers, the CQC administers the
compulsory registration system and issues guidance to care service providers on
how to comply with applicable standards set out in legislation.



The CQC is also empowered to carry out
inspections of care home premises to verify compliance with the standards set
out in legislation. The CQC’s current policy is to carry out routine
unannounced inspections at care homes at least once a year. Reports of all
inspections in England are published, as are details of enforcement actions
taken by the CQC, which can include issuing warning notices, restricting the
services that the provider can offer, stopping admissions into the care
service, issuing fixed penalty notices, suspending or cancelling the service
registration and prosecution.



The Care Act 2014 sets out certain provisions which
are not yet in force concerning (among others):

·The duty of a local authority to
meet the needs of an adult for care and support and a carer’s needs where the
registered care provider is unable to carry on a regulated activity because of
business failure;

·The duty of the CQC to assess the
financial sustainability of providers subject to its regulatory regime with a
view to identifying any threats that such providers may face to their financial
sustainability. Where the CQC identifies a significant risk to financial
sustainability it can require the provider to develop a sustainability plan
setting out the provider’s plan to mitigate or eliminate risk or require the
provider to organize an independent review of the business with the costs being
recovered from the provider; and

·A new offense where certain
registered care providers supply, publish or make available information that is
false or misleading in a material respect.



Financial Assistance for Service
Users



Financial assistance for service users towards care
home fees is available from local authorities and is means-tested. The National
Health Service may also, in certain circumstances, contribute towards the costs
of nursing care.



Privacy



In the European Union (“EU”), data protection is
governed by the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (the “Data Protection
Directive”). The Data Protection Directive has been implemented in the UK by
the Data Protection Act 1998 (the “Act”) which entered into force on March 2000
and is enforced by the Information Commissioner’s Office (“ICO”).



The Act applies to a data controller that processes
personal data in the context of an establishment in the UK, or where not
established in the UK, in any other State of the European Economic Area
(“EEA”), processes personal data through equipment located in the UK other than
for the purposes of transit through the UK. Under the Act, a data controller is
the person who (either alone or jointly or in common with other persons)
determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data
are, or are to be, processed. Personal data is widely defined as data which
relates to a living individual who can be identified from those data, or from those
data and other information which is in the possession of, or is likely to come
into the possession of, the data controller. Sensitive personal data is
personal data consisting of information as to the racial or ethnic origin of
the data subject; his/her political opinions, religious beliefs or other
beliefs of a similar nature; whether he/she is a member of a trade union;
his/her physical or mental health or condition; his/her sexual life; and the
commission or alleged commission by him/her of an offense, any proceedings for
any








offense committed or alleged to have been
committed by him/her, the disposal of such proceedings, or the sentence of any
court in such proceedings.



The Act imposes a number of obligations on the
data controller contained in eight Data Protection Principles: (i) personal
data must be processed fairly and lawfully, (ii) personal data must be
processed for specified and lawful purposes, (iii) personal data must be
adequate, relevant and not excessive, (iv) personal data must be accurate and
up to date, (v) personal data must not be kept for longer than necessary, (vi)
personal data must be processed in accordance with the rights of data subjects,
(vii) appropriate technical and organizational measures shall be taken against
unauthorized or unlawful processing of personal data and against accidental
loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data; and (viii) there is a
prohibition on transfers of personal data to countries outside the EEA that are
not deemed by the European Commission to provide an adequate level of
protection, which includes the U.S., unless certain exemptions under the Act
apply.



The ICO has a number of enforcement powers
available which includes, in certain limited cases, criminal prosecution and
non-criminal enforcement and audits.  In case of a breach of the Act, the ICO
may: (i) provide practical advice to organizations on how they should handle
data protection matters; (ii) issue undertakings committing an organization to
a particular course of action in order to improve its compliance; (iii) serve
enforcement notices where there has been a breach, requiring organizations to
take (or refrain from taking) specified steps in order to ensure they comply
with the law; (iv) conduct consensual assessments (audits) to determine if
organizations are complying; (v) serve assessment notices to conduct compulsory
audits to assess whether organizations’ processing of personal data follows
good data protection practices; (vi) issue monetary penalty notices requiring
organizations to pay up to £500,000 for serious breaches of the Act occurring
on or after April 6, 2010 or serious breaches of the Privacy and Electronic
Communications Regulations occurring after May 26, 2011; and (vii) prosecute
those who commit criminal offenses under the Act.  Under the Act, individuals
also have the right to claim compensation from an organization in respect of
damage caused by a breach of any of the requirements of the Act.



There is a proposal for an EU Data
Protection Regulation which would replace the Data Protection Directive and
impose a significant number of new obligations including, among others, a
requirement to appoint data protection officers, having detailed documentation
on the processing of personal data, carrying out privacy impact assessments in
certain circumstances, providing standardized data protection notices,
reporting security breaches without undue delay, and providing certain rights
to individuals such as a right of erasure of personal data. The EU Data Protection
Regulation is to have significant enforcement powers with fines proposed by the
European Commission of up 2% of annual worldwide turnover and with fines
proposed by the European Parliament of up to 5% of annual worldwide turnover or
€100 million, whichever is greater. The EU Data Protection Regulation may be
adopted sometime in 2015 with EU Member States possibly having two years to
implement the Regulation.



Canada



Retirement homes and long-term care facilities are subject to regulation, and long-term
care facilities receive funding, under provincial law.  There is no federal
regulation in this area.  Set out below are summaries of the principal
regulatory requirements in the provinces where we have a material number of
facilities.



Licensing and Regulation



Alberta



In Alberta, there are three relevant designations for
seniors’ living arrangements, ordered below from the most independent to the
highest level of care.



Retirement Homes(also referred to as independent living) are designed for older adults
who are able to live on their own. These communities may offer amenities such
as fitness centers, gardens, paths, libraries, and beauty salons. Residents may
access publicly-funded external care services at the home from funded external suppliers.



Alberta retirement residences may be rented, privately
owned, or life-leased. They may be operated for profit or non-profit.
Retirement residences typically do not offer support services but residents may
arrange support services separate from their accommodations.



Retirement homes do not generally receive government
funding; residents pay for tenancy and services received at retirement homes. 
Rental subsidies may be available to qualified seniors.



Alberta Independent Living residences are legislated
under the Residential Tenancies Act, SA 2004, c R-17.1 and the Alberta Housing
Act, RSA 2000, c A-25.












Supportive Living(also referred to as assisted living) provides accommodation in a
home-like setting, where residents can remain as independent as possible while
still having access to necessary care, assistance, and services. A provider of
designated Supportive Living services provides at least one meal a day or
housekeeping services. Supportive living includes many different types of
facilities, including seniors lodges, group homes, and mental health and
designated supportive living accommodations. These facilities can be operated
by private for-profit, private not-for-profit, or public operators.



Supportive Living services are licensed under the
Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Act, SA 2009, c S-23.5, and the
Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Regulation, Alta Reg 40/2010. They
are governed by the Ministry of Health.



Operators that receive public funds, either directly
or indirectly, for health and personal care services must also comply with the
Ministry of Health Continuing Care Health Service Standards (March 2007, and
revised). They are also subject to the Protection for Persons in Care Act, SA
2009, c P-29.1, under which the province investigates suspected abuse of adults
receiving government-funded care services.



Licenses may be granted for periods of six months to
three years, depending on how long the facility has been licensed, and
depending on past reports. The Ministry, through a designated director, may
conduct inspections of facilities and review records. The Director may order a
delinquent facility to take specific steps or to stop certain practices or may
temporarily stop operations; alternatively, the facility’s license may be
suspended.



There are four levels of supportive living, ordered
from basic to more advance care: (1) Residential Living (residents can manage
most daily tasks and direct own care and assistance can be scheduled); (2)
Lodge Living (residents can manage some daily tasks and direct own care and
assistance can be scheduled, although some non-scheduled assistance may be
required); (3) Assisted Living (residents require assistance with many daily
tasks, with increased scheduled and some non-scheduled assistance required);
(4) Enhanced Level (residents require assistance with most or all daily tasks
and frequent unscheduled assistance). In addition, there are two specialized
designations of Supportive Care: (1) Alberta Enhanced Assisted Living (also
referred to as Enhanced Lodges or Alberta Designated Supportive Living Level 4
(SL4) (provides 24-hour scheduled and unscheduled professional, personal care
and support services provided by Licensed Practical Nurses and Health Care
Aides); and (2) Enhanced Assisted Living Dementia Care Sites (also referred to
as Designated Supportive Living Level 4 Dementia (SL4-D)) (provides assisted
living for seniors living with cognitive impairments (such as Alzheimer’s
disease or other types of dementia) who require safe and secure living
accommodation in a therapeutic environment).



Residents pay a fee to cover the costs of providing
accommodations and services like meals, housekeeping and building maintenance.
The accommodation fee varies by accommodation type and the services or
amenities that are available to the resident. Alberta Health regulates the
maximum accommodation fee in publicly-funded designated supportive living. In
other types of supportive living settings, the operator sets the cost of
accommodation. Health services are publicly-funded and provided through Alberta
Health Services. Private sector operators of Supportive Living facilities are
eligible to apply for funding under the Affordable Supportive Living Initiative
(“ASLI”), an Alberta government capital grant program that provides funding to
develop long-term care and affordable supportive living spaces in the province.



Nursing Homes(also referred to as long-term care) are for residents who have complex,
unpredictable medical needs and who require 24-hour on-site registered nurse
assessment or treatment.



Nursing homes are subject to the Nursing Homes Act,
RSA 2000, c N-7, and the Nursing Home General Regulation, Alta Reg 232/1985,
and Long-term Care Accommodation Standards. They are governed by the Ministry
of Health.



Nursing home operators are not licensed, but enter
into agreements with the Ministry for the operation of nursing homes. These
facilities can be operated by private for-profit, private not-for-profit, or
public operators.



All operators must comply with the Ministry of Health
Long-term Care Accommodation Standards (March 2007, and revised). Operators
that receive public funds, either directly or indirectly, for health and
personal care services must also comply with the Continuing Care Health Service
Standards and are subject to the Protection for Persons in Care Act.



The Ministry may conduct inspections of facilities and
review records. Deficient facilities may be ordered to submit a correction
plan.



Residents pay an accommodation fee to cover the costs
of providing accommodations and services like meals, housekeeping and building
maintenance. Alberta Health regulates the maximum accommodation fee in
publicly-funded long-term care facilities. In other types of supportive living
settings, the accommodation fee is set by the operator. Health services in
long-term care are publicly-funded








and provided
through Alberta Health Services. Private sector operators of nursing homes are
eligible to apply for funding under the ASLI. The Minister may make grants to
an operator in respect of its operating or capital costs as prescribed by the
regulations.



Ontario



Long-term care facilities, or nursing homes, receive government funding, are
licensed under the Long-Term Care Homes Act, 2007and are governed by
the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.  The LTC Homes Act places a strong
emphasis on the protection of residents.



Retirement homes in Ontario are regulated under the Retirement Homes Act, 2010
(the “Act”).  Retirement homes do not receive any government funding; residents
pay for tenancy and services received at retirement homes.  Residents may
access publicly-funded external care services at the home from funded external
suppliers.



A license is required to operate a retirement home.  Licenses must be applied
for and are non-transferable.  Applications for licenses are directed to the
Registrar of the Retirement Homes Regulatory Authority (RHRA).  All of the
homes in which we have an interest in Ontario are licensed as retirement homes.
One of the homes also has some licensed long-term care beds.



Licenses can have conditions imposed upon them or can be suspended in
circumstances where the operator is found to be in contravention of the Act. 
There is no set renewal period for licenses, and they terminate according to
the terms set out in the license itself, or if one of the enumerated triggering
mechanisms occurs (for example, if the operator ceases to have controlling
interest in the license).



The
licensee of a retirement home must ensure that the care provided by the home
meets prescribed standards.  The Act and its regulations include a number of
detailed provisions with respect to care standards, safety plans in the event
of emergency or infectious disease, temperature control, cleanliness, pest
control, maintenance, food preparations, risk of resident falls and behavioral
management, among other things.  A care plan must be developed for each
resident of the home (with their consent). The Act establishes a Residents’
Bill of Rights, which provides residents with a list of rights, such as the
right to participate fully in decision-making with respect to care, the right
not to be restrained and the right to know what care services are provided and
their cost.  The Residents’ Bill of Rights can be enforced as a contract.



The Act requires a report to the RHRA when any person has reasonable grounds to
suspect abuse of a resident by anyone, or neglect of a resident by staff. 
Following a report to the RHRA, there is a mandatory inspection carried out by
the RHRA, which results in a report that is posted on the RHRA’s public
website. The most recent report must also be posted in the subject home, and be
readily available for review if requested thereafter.



The Registrar of the RHRA has the power to inspect a retirement home at any
time without warning or issue a warrant to ensure compliance with the Act. 
Compliance inspections occur at least every three years. The Registrar has the
power to make a variety of orders including, for example, the imposition of a
fine or an order revoking the operator’s license.  There is an appeal process
in place with respect to orders made by the Registrar.  The Act also enumerates
offenses, such as operating without a license, and provides for penalties for
offenses.



British Columbia



The Community Care and Assisted Living Act, the Residential Care Regulation,
and the Community Care and Assisted Living Regulation(together, the
“B.C. Act”) regulate “community care facilities” (long-term care facilities) in
substantially the same manner as retirement homes are regulated under the
Ontario Act. The B.C. Act defines such a facility as premises used for the
purpose of supervising vulnerable persons who require three or more prescribed
services.



The B.C. Act also creates a separate regime for regulating “assisted living
residences,” which are facilities providing at least one but not more than two
prescribed care services. Assisted living residences are designed for those who
can live independently, but who require assistance with certain activities.
Unlike community care facilities, assisted living residences must be registered
with the registrar of assisted living residences, but do not require a license.
Nevertheless, assisted living residences must be operated in a manner that does
not jeopardize the health or safety of its residents. If the registrar has
reason to believe a residence is not being operated in accordance with this
standard, the registrar may inspect the assisted living residence and may
suspend or cancel a registration.  Most of the residences in which we have an
interest in B.C. are assisted living residences, with one being an independent
living residence.



Independent living residences offer housing and hospitality services for
retired adults who are functionally independent and able to direct their own
care.   Services available for residents can include, for example, meals,
housekeeping, monitoring and emergency support, social and recreational
opportunities, and transportation.










Québec



In Québec, retirement homes are regulated by the Act respecting Health Services
and Social Services (the “Act”) and the Regulation respecting the conditions
for obtaining a certificate of compliance and the operating standards for a
private seniors' residence (the “Regulation”), which refer to “private seniors’
residences.” Private seniors’ residences in Québec are required to obtain a
certificate of compliance. The Regulation is currently in the process of being
amended.



A certificate of compliance is issued for a period of three years, is renewable
and can only be validly transferred to another person with the written
permission of the regional licensing agency. An agency may revoke a temporary
certificate, or revoke or refuse to issue or renew a certificate of compliance
if, among other things, the operator fails to comply with the Act and the
Regulation, although the decision of the applicable agency can be contested
before the Administrative Tribunal of Québec. The agency may also order the
residence to take corrective measures, further to an inspection, complaint
and/or investigation. The agency is authorized to inspect a residence, at any
reasonable time of day, in order to ascertain whether it complies with the Act
and the Regulation.



Private seniors’ residences may belong to either or both of the following two
categories: those offering services to independent elderly persons and those
offering services to semi-independent elderly persons. The operator of a
residence must, for each category, comply with the applicable criteria and
standards, with some exceptions provided for residences with fewer than six or
ten rooms or apartments. The Act and the Regulation set out a number of
detailed provisions with respect to residents’ health and safety (including
mandatory call-for-help systems, safety plans in the event of fire or
infectious disease, health assessments, permissible control measures, as well
as administration and distribution of medication), meal services and
recreation, content of residents’ files, disclosure of information to
residents, and staffing requirements, among other things.



Other Related Laws



Privacy



The services provided in our facilities are generally subject to privacy
legislation in Canada, including, in certain provinces, privacy laws
specifically related to personal health information.  Although the obligations
of custodians of personal health information in the various provinces differ to
some extent, they all include the obligation to protect the information.  The
organizations with which we have management agreements may be the custodian of
personal health information/personal information collected in connection with
the operation of our facilities.



Privacy laws in Canada are consent-based and require the implementation of a
privacy program involving policies, procedures and the designation of an
individual or team with primary responsibility for a custodian’s privacy law
compliance.  Mandatory breach notification is a requirement under some laws. 
Some laws require notification where personal health information/personal
information is processed or stored outside of Canada.  One provincial law (in
Quebec) provides for fines where an organization fails to perform required due
diligence before outsourcing activities involving personal information to a
service provider outside of the province.



Some privacy regulators in Canada have order-making authority and others are
ombudspersons who make recommendations that may only be enforced by a court.
Under a number of privacy laws, a finding by a regulator that a custodian has
breached the law creates a right to apply to a court for money damages.  In
some provinces there is a statutory civil cause of action for breach of
privacy. In other provinces, the courts have recognized a limited common law
cause of action for breach of privacy.



The powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law
vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts.  To date,
penalties have generally not been monetary, although that may change depending
on decisions in connection with class actions.  Regulators have the authority
to make public the identity of a health information custodian that has been
found to have committed a breach, so that there is a reputational risk
associated with privacy law violations even where no monetary damages are
incurred. The notification of patients (mandatory under some privacy laws) and
other activities required to manage a privacy breach can give rise to
significant costs.



Other Legislation



Retirement homes may be
subject to residential tenancy laws, such that there can be restrictions on
rent increases and termination of tenancies, for instance.  Other provincial
legislation applicable to occupational health and safety, public health, and
the provision of community health care and funded long-term/post-acute care may
also apply to retirement homes.  In addition, municipal laws with respect to
matters such as fire safety, food services and zoning would also apply.



Taxation










Federal Income Tax
Considerations



The following summary of the taxation of the Company
and the material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity
securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary
does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types
of holders of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance
companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated
conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in
securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities,
investors in pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who are
not citizens or residents of the United States).



This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular
investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss
any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax
law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including
changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied
retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth
in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your
own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local,
foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our
securities.



General



We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (a “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We intend to continue
to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there is no guarantee
that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for subsequent years.
Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety
of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to
income, assets, distribution level and diversity of share ownership as
discussed below under “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so
as to qualify or remain qualified.



In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general,
we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may,
however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or
capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our
net long-term capital gains, stockholders are required to include their proportionate
share of our undistributed long-term capital gains in income, but they will
receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such
gain.



Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to
federal income and excise tax as follows:



•     To the extent that we do not distribute all of
our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our
“REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the
undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates;



•     We may be subject to the “alternative minimum
tax” (the “AMT”) on certain tax preference items to the extent that the AMT
exceeds our regular tax;



•     If we have net income from the sale or other
disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income
from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate
rate;



•     Any net income from prohibited transactions
(which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than
dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an
involuntary conversion) will be subject to a 100% tax;



•     If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95%
gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our
qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross income attributable
to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount of
qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (discussed
below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross
income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (discussed below) multiplied
by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;



•     If we fail to distribute during each year at
least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
(2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than
capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any
undistributed taxable income from preceding periods, we will be subject to a 4%
excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed;



•     We will be subject to a 100% tax on the amount
of any rents from real property, deductions or excess interest paid to us by
any of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that would be reduced through
reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in








order
to more clearly reflect income of the taxable REIT subsidiary. See
“— Qualification as a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries;” and



•     We may be subject to the corporate “alternative
minimum tax” on any items of tax preference, including any deductions of net
operating losses.





Qualification as a REIT



A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or
association:



(1)     which is managed by one or more trustees or
directors;



(2)     the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced
by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;



(3)     which would be taxable as a domestic
corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to REITs;



(4)     which is neither a financial institution nor
an insurance company;



(5)     the beneficial ownership of which is held by
100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first
taxable year;



(6)     not more than 50% in value of the outstanding
stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding
its first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer
individuals (which includes certain entities) (the “Five or Fewer
Requirement”); and



(7)     which meets certain income and asset tests
described below.



Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met
during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes
of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt
entities are treated as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception in
the case of condition (6).



Based on publicly available information, we believe we
have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in (5) and
(6) above. In addition, Article VI of our by-laws provides for
restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements
described in (5) and (6) above. These restrictions, however, may not
ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership
requirements described in (5) and (6) above.



We have complied with, and will continue to comply
with, regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders
requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If, despite
sending the annual letters, we do not know, or after exercising reasonable
diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer Requirement. If
we fail to comply with these regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary
penalty. If our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the
requirement, the penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty would be
imposed.



We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified REIT subsidiary” if
100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the
subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary.








A “qualified
REIT subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets,
liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a “qualified REIT
subsidiary” will be treated as assets, liabilities and items (as the case may
be) of the REIT. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal income
tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary will
not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer
which constitute more than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer
or more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described below under
“— Asset Tests.”



If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability
company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s, limited liability
company’s or trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving our
share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited liability company or
trust, and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it
has in the hands of the partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
“look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests
described below.



Income Tests.There
are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that
we must satisfy for each taxable year.



•     At least 75% of our gross income (excluding
gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real
property,” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages
on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.



•     At least 95% of our gross income (excluding
gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources
qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including
dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries) and interest.



As to transactions entered into in taxable years
beginning after October 22, 2004 and on or prior to July 30, 2008, any of
our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is entered into
by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the
risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with
respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such
other risks that are prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is excluded
from the 95% gross income test.



For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to
manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency
fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be
incurred by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.



For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered
into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to
any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75%
gross income tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.



In general, a hedging transaction is “clearly
identified” if (1) the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction
before the end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the items or
risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the
hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially contemporaneous if
it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction.





Generally, other than income from “clearly identified”
hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business, any
foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing, or engaging in substantial
and regular trading, in securities will constitute gross income which does not
qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests.










Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if
several conditions are met:



•     The amount of rent must not be based in whole or
in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or
percentages of receipts or sales.



•     Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as
rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the
tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met
with respect to the real property being rented.



•     If rent attributable to personal property leased
in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such
personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.”



•     For rents to qualify as rents from real
property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other
than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom
we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are
“usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property
is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only,
or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”



•     For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008,
the REIT may lease“qualified
health careproperties”on an
arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on
behalf of such subsidiary by a person whoqualifies as an
“independent contractor” and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively
engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any
person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary, an “eligible independent contractor.”Generally, the rent that the REIT
receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real
property.”A “qualified health care property” includes any real
property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to
the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate
care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility that
extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by
a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the Medicare
program with respect to such facility.



A REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of
impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect
to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by
the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to
a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT
directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service
or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than
150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may
be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain
conditions, and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property
as rent from real property.



The term “interest” generally does not
include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will
not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a
fixed percentage of receipts or sales.



If we fail to satisfy one or both of
the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless
qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief.  These relief
provisions generally will be available if (1) following our identification
of the failure, we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item
of our gross income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.



It is not now possible to determine
the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an
amount equal to (a) the gross income attributable to (1) 75% of our
gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75%
income test and (2) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying
gross income for purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a
fraction intended to reflect our profitability.



The Secretary of the Treasury is given
broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify
or not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be excluded from the
measure of gross income for such purposes.



Asset Tests.Within 30 days after
the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several
tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the
value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation),
government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the
remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we
are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the
vote (the








“10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value
test”) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT
subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than
25% of the total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable
REIT subsidiaries (the “25% asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of
our total assets may be represented by securities of any non-governmental
issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another
REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value
test and the 25% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each
quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the value related
tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.



Certain items are excluded from the
10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities (as defined in
Internal Revenue Code Section 1361(c)(5)) of an issuer (including straight debt
that provides certain contingent payments); (2) any loan to an individual
or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of
the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a “related person”; (4) any
obligation to pay rents from real property; (5) certain securities issued
by a state or any subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign
government, or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto
Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any other
arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted
from the definition of security (“excluded securities”). Special rules apply to
straight debt securities issued by corporations and entities taxable as
partnerships for federal income tax purposes. If a REIT, or its taxable REIT
subsidiary, holds (1) straight debt securities of a corporate or
partnership issuer and (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded
securities and have an aggregate value greater than 1% of such issuer’s
outstanding securities, the straight debt securities will be included in the
10% value test.



A REIT’s interest as a partner in a
partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt instrument
issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10%
value test (1) to the extent of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the
partnership and (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income
(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75%
gross income test.  For purposes of the 10% value test, a REIT’s interest in a
partnership’s assets is determined by the REIT’s proportionate interest in any
securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded securities
described in the preceding paragraph).



For taxable years beginning after
July 30, 2008, if the REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its
functional currency, the term “cash” includes such foreign currency, but only
to the extent such foreign currency is (i) held for use in the normal
course of the activities of the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income
or gain that are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly
related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and
(ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and
regular trading in securities.



With respect to corrections of
failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5% asset
test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of sufficient
assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s
assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that the
disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in
which the REIT first identified the assets. For violations of any of the REIT
asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the
thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking
certain steps, including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month
period described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to
the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that
the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the
Internal Revenue Service that describes the non-qualifying assets.



Investments in Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries.REITs may own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in
taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity in which we own
an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable
REIT subsidiary.”



Certain of our subsidiaries have
elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries
are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are
permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed
directly by REITs without jeopardizing their REIT status. Our taxable REIT
subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can
be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes
will be successful. To the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to
pay federal, state or local taxes, the cash available for distribution as
dividends to us from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.



The amount of interest on
related-party debt that a taxable REIT subsidiary may deduct is limited.
Further, a 100% tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable REIT
subsidiary to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted to deduct
interest payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions.



The Internal Revenue Service may
reallocate costs between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is
a lack of arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible expenses
allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would increase its tax liability.
Further, any amount by which a REIT understates its deductions and overstates
those of its taxable REIT subsidiary may, subject to certain exceptions, be
subject to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may be made
in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest.










Annual
Distribution Requirements.



It is also possible that, from time to
time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be
necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things,
(1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and
actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the
payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In the event
that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for
borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock
dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement.



Under certain circumstances, in the
event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be
able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a
year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year, which
may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year.
Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency
dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and
interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend
distributions.



Failure to Qualify as a REIT



If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any
taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate
rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as
a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions
be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be
taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings
and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain limitations,
will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate
stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we
also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years
following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to
state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief.
Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur
indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant
resulting tax liabilities.



In addition to the relief described above under
“— Income Tests” and “— Asset Tests,” relief is available in the
event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would
result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of
$50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation
does not include a violation described under “— Income Tests” or
“— Asset Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the
circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions.



Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock



Treatment of Taxable U.S. Stockholders.The following summary applies to you only
if you are a “U.S. stockholder.” A “U.S. stockholder” is a holder of
shares of stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:



•     a citizen or resident of the United States;



•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision of the United States, including any state;



•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or



•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial








decisions.



So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT,
distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as
capital gain dividends) will be includable as ordinary income for federal
income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the
dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.



Generally, the current maximum marginal rate of tax
payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject
to a corporate level of tax is 20%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax
rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because
generally we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced
maximum federal income tax rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends
received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to:
(1) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable
REIT subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect to which we
were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year (if,
for example, we did not distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the
prior year); or (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were
distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.



Distributions that are designated as capital gain
dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the
period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may
be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary
income.



If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net
long-term capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain,
your proportionate share of this net long-term capital gain. You would also
receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by
us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis
of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains
less your share of the tax deemed paid.



You may not include in your federal income tax return
any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules may
also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be
apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October,
November or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be
treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year, provided
that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31 of the
following year.





Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock
to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our
stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of
our stock. This gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
as a capital asset.



If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment
can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend
income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the
redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such
redemption: (1) results in a “complete termination” of your interest in
all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a “substantially
disproportionate redemption”; or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a
dividend” with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into
account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common
stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take
into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively
owned by you.



If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares,
you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial
percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of
your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and,
thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However,








whether
a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of
the facts and circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time
of redemption, you should consult your tax advisor to determine their
application to the particular situation.



Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests
described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your
shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of
the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the
redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed
shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis
may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely.



Gain from the sale or exchange of our
shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term
capital gain rate of 20% in the case of stockholders who are individuals and
35% in the case of stockholders that are corporations.  Pursuant to Internal
Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain
dividends as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as gain
taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.  Capital losses
recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for more
than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital
losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income of the
stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may
offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).



An additional tax
of 3.8% generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of U.S.
stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or
certain trusts.  Among
other items, “net investment income” generally includes gross income from
dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property,
such as shares of our common stock or warrants. In the case of individuals,
this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted
gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing a joint
return and surviving spouses, and $125,000 for married individuals filing a
separate return). U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding
the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular
circumstances.



Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders.Tax-exempt
entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and
individual retirement accounts (“Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt
from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The Internal Revenue Service has
issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an
exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the
exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us
to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an
Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with
debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the
“debt financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of the Exempt
Organization’s income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual
interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit.



In addition, in certain circumstances,
a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a
percentage of our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the percentage of our
income that is UBTI (determined as if we were a pension trust) is at least 5%;
(2) we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the Five or
Fewer Requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated
as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension
trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the
value of our stock, or (ii) a group of pension trusts individually holding
more than 10% of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
value of our stock.



Backup Withholding and Information
Reporting.Under
certain circumstances, you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable
rates on payments made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange
of, shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you:
(1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you
are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish
an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the
Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of
interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury,
that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the
Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup
withholding.



Backup withholding will not apply with
respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding
qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the procedure for
obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather,
the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder
will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided
that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to
stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their
non-foreign status.



Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.The following summary
applies to you only if you are a foreign person. The federal taxation of
foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many
considerations.










Except as
discussed below, distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate
operations in the form of ordinary dividends, but not by the sale or exchange
of our capital assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax
at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file
with us the required form evidencing the lower rate.



In general, you will be subject to
United States federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than
withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
“effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is, or is
treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in addition to
regular United States corporate income tax. The following discussion will apply
to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected.
We expect to withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the
gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the
distribution is “effectively connected” or (2) certain other exceptions
apply.



Distributions by us that are
attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property
interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were gains “effectively
connected” with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, you will be
taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a
special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals.
Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax in
the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty
exemption.



We will be required to withhold from distributions
subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of designated
capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the amount of any distributions
that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we
designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent
distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld
against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.



Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of
stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be
treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more
than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign
stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received
from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated
as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such
capital gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax
(unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In
addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions.



Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively connected with
a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our shares by you generally will not
be subject to United States taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled REIT.” We
believe that we, and expect to continue to, qualify as a domestically
controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times
during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held
directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders. However, if you are a
nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for
183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions
apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a
purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold
on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an
established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise,
under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 10% of the purchase
price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue Service.



Backup withholding tax and information reporting will
generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States that
are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower treaty rate
withholding tax discussed above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or
(3) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of
U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock
within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related
financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information
reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that
he or she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual
knowledge that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise
established an exemption. You may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under
the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with
the Internal Revenue Service.



Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on certain payments to you or
certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other non-US
persons receiving payments on your behalf, including distributions in respect
of shares of our stock and gross proceeds from the sale of shares of our stock,
if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence,
disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued Treasury
regulations. Accordingly, the entity through which shares of our stock are held
will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required.
Withholding currently applies to payments of dividends made after June 30, 2014,
and will apply to payments of gross proceeds from a sale of shares of our stock
made after December 31, 2016.  Stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an
exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such
dividends and proceeds will be required to seek a refund from the Internal
Revenue Service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. 
Additional requirements and conditions may be imposed pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement, if and when entered into, between the United
States and such institution’s home jurisdiction. We will not pay any additional
amounts to








any stockholders in respect of any amounts
withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S.
withholding taxes and the application of the recently issued Treasury
regulations in light of your particular circumstances.



U.S. Federal Income
Taxation of Holders of Depositary Shares



Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if
you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary
shares. Thus, you will be required to take into account the income and
deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the
underlying series of preferred stock.



Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred Stock.No gain or loss will be recognized upon
the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax
basis of each share of preferred stock will, upon exchange, be the same as the
aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged. If you held your
depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will
include the period during which you owned the depositary shares.



U.S. Federal Income
and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt Securities



The following is a general summary of the United
States federal income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
that is a non-U.S. holder, as defined below, the United States federal
estate tax consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt securities
periodically offered under one or more indentures (the “notes”). This summary
assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you
only if you are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes for a
price equal to the issue price of the notes. The issue price of the notes is
the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold other than to
bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity
of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this summary
does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax laws that may be
applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.



U.S. Holders



The following summary applies to you only if you are a
  U.S. holder, as defined below.



Definition of a U.S. Holder.A “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner
of a note or notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:



•     a citizen or resident of the United States;



•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision
of the United States, including any state;



•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or



•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.



Payments of Interest.Stated interest on the notes generally
will be taxed as ordinary interest income from domestic sources at the time it
is paid or accrues in accordance with your method of accounting for tax
purposes.



Sale,
Exchange or Other Disposition of Notes.The
adjusted tax basis in your note acquired at a premium will generally be your
cost. You generally will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or
otherwise dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:



•     the amount realized on the sale or other
disposition, less any amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will
be taxable in the manner described under “— Payments of Interest”
above; and



•     your adjusted tax basis in the notes.



Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or
loss. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if at
the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the notes for more than
one year. Subject to limited exceptions, your capital losses cannot be used to
offset your ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset
up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).










Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.In general, “backup withholding” may apply
to any payments made to you of principal and interest on your note, and to
payment of the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before
maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and: (1) fail to
provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an
individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect
taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue
Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or
dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you
have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal
Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup
withholding.



The amount of any reportable payments, including
interest, made to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be reported to you and
to the Internal Revenue Service for each calendar year. You should consult your
tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be credited
against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that correct
information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service.



Non-U.S. Holders



The following summary applies to you if you are a
beneficial owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above (a
“non-U.S. holder”).



Special rules may apply to certain
non-U.S. holders such as “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive
foreign investment companies” and “foreign personal holding companies.” Such
entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to
them.



U.S. Federal
Withholding Tax.Subject
to the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to
payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, of principal and
interest on your notes under the “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal
Revenue Code, provided that:



•     you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or
constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of our stock entitled to vote;



•     you are not (1) a controlled foreign
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly
or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as provided in the
Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank receiving interest described in
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code;



•     such interest is not effectively connected with
your conduct of a U.S. trade or business; and



•     you provide a signed written statement, under
penalties of perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that you
are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and
providing your name and address to:



•      us or our paying agent; or



•a securities clearing
organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’
securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes
on your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under penalties of
perjury that it, or the bank or financial institution between it and you, has
received from you your signed, written statement and provides us or our paying
agent with a copy of such statement.



Treasury regulations provide that:



•     if you are a foreign partnership, the
certification requirement will generally apply to your partners, and you will
be required to provide certain information;



•     if you are a foreign trust, the certification
requirement will generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners
depending on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,” “foreign simple trust,”
or “foreign grantor trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and



•     look-through rules will apply for tiered
partnerships, foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.



If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust,
you should consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
Treasury regulations and the certification requirements applicable to you.










If you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest
requirements described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30%
United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed
(1) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming an exemption from
or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable treaty or
(2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid
on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively
connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States.
Alternative documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.



If you are engaged in a trade or business in the
United States and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United States federal
income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt
from the 30% withholding tax provided the certification requirement described
above is met) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a foreign
corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits tax on the earnings
and profits that are effectively connected to the conduct of your trade or
business in the United States.



Withholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on payments of interest
(including original issue discount) and gross proceeds of sale in respect of
debt instruments to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including
investment funds) and other non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf,
if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence,
disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in recently issued Treasury
regulations. However, the Treasury regulations generally exempt from such
withholding requirement obligations, such as debt instruments, issued before July
1, 2014, provided that any material modification of such an obligation made
after such date will result in such obligation being considered newly issued as
of the effective date of such modification. These withholding rules are
generally effective with respect to payments of interest made after June 30,
2014, and with respect to proceeds of sales received after December 31, 2016.
We will not pay any additional amounts to any holders or our debt instruments
in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax
advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of the recently
issued Treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances.



Sale, Exchange or other Disposition of Notes.You generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from the sale, redemption,
retirement at maturity or other disposition of your notes, unless:



•     in the case of gain, you are an individual who
is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable
year of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific other
conditions are met;



•     you are subject to tax provisions applicable to
certain United States expatriates; or



•     the gain is effectively connected with your
conduct of a U.S. trade or business.



If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that
trade or business, you generally will be subject to U.S. income tax on a
net basis on the gain. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may
be subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected earnings and
profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.



U.S. Federal
Estate Tax.If you are an
individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States,
as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, at the time of
your death, your notes will generally not be subject to the U.S. federal
estate tax, unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all our
classes of stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest on the notes is
effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business.



Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.Backup withholding will not apply to
payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying agent, in its
capacity as such, to you if you have provided the required certification that
you are a non-U.S. holder as described in “— U.S. Federal
Withholding Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying agent have
actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as described in
“— U.S. Holders” above. We or our paying agent may, however, report
payments of interest on the notes.



The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes
may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If you sell
your notes outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a
non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information reporting requirements
generally will not apply to that payment. However, U.S. information
reporting, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales
proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell
your notes through a non-U.S. office of a broker that:



•     is a U.S. person, as defined in the
Internal Revenue Code;



•     derives 50% or more of its gross income in
specific periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;










•     is a “controlled foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or



•     is a foreign partnership, if at any time during
its tax year, one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the aggregate
hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the partnership, or
the foreign partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, unless the
broker has documentary evidence in its files that you are a
non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise
establish an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale of
your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the payment is subject
to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you
provide a Form W-8BEN certifying that you are a non-U.S. person or
you otherwise establish an exemption.



You should consult your own tax advisor regarding
application of backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup
withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a
payment to you will be allowed as a refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to
the Internal Revenue Service.



U.S. Federal Income
and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Warrants



Exercise of Warrants.You will not generally recognize gain or
loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your basis in the debt securities, preferred
stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the
exercise of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax basis in
the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding period in the debt
securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may
be, received upon the exercise of the warrant will not include the period
during which the warrant was held by you.



Expiration of Warrants.Upon the expiration of a warrant, you will
recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis in the
warrant.



Sale or
Exchange of Warrants.Upon
the sale or exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized
on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain
or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of the warrant to
us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that you should recognize ordinary
income on the sale. You are advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the
consequences of a sale of a warrant to us.



Potential Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax
Consequences



Current and prospective securities holders should
recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time
and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously
made. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under
review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of regulations
and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory
changes. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could
adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.



State, Local and Foreign Taxes



We, and holders of our debt and equity securities, may
be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions,
including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside.
It should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state, local
and foreign jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or
all of those jurisdictions. The state, local or foreign tax treatment of us and
holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax consequences discussed above. Consequently, you are urged to consult
your advisor regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign
tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities.



Internet Access to Our SEC Filings
