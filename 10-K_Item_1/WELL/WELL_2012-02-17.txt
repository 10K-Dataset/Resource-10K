Item 1.Business



General



Health Care REIT, Inc. is a real estate investment
trust (“REIT”) that has been at the forefront of seniors housing and health
care real estate since the company was founded in 1970.  We are an S&P 500
company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio and our portfolio spans the full spectrum
of seniors housing and health care real estate, including seniors housing
communities, skilled nursing/post-acute facilities, medical office buildings,
inpatient and outpatient medical centers and life science facilities. Our
capital programs, when combined with comprehensive planning, development and
property management services, make us a single-source solution for acquiring,
planning, developing, managing, repositioning and monetizing real estate
assets.  More information is available on the Internet at www.hcreit.com.



Our primary objectives are to protect stockholder
capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends
to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to
stockholders as a result of annual increases in rental and interest income and
portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum
of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment
portfolio by property type, customer and geographic location.



Depending upon the availability and cost of external
capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund operations, meet debt
service obligations (both principal and interest), make dividend distributions
and complete construction projects in process. We also continue to evaluate
opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally
funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured line of credit
arrangement, internally generated cash and the proceeds from sales of real
property. Our investments generate cash from rent and interest receipts,
resident fees and services and principal payments on loans receivable.
Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under
the unsecured line of credit arrangement, has historically been provided
through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity
securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.



References herein to “we,” “us,” “our” or the
“Company” refer to Health Care REIT, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless
specifically noted otherwise.

Property Types



We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate.
We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business
segments — seniors housing triple-net, seniors housing operating, and medical
facilities.For additional information regarding business segments, see
Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements.The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described
in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to our
consolidated financial statements).The following is a summary of our
various property types.












Seniors
Housing Triple-Net



Our seniors
housing triple-net properties include independent living/continuing care
retirement communities, assisted living facilities, Alzheimer’s/dementia
facilities, skilled nursing/post-acute facilities and combinations thereof. We
invest in seniors housing triple-net real estate primarily through acquisitions
and development. Properties are primarily leased under triple-net leases and we
are not involved in property management.  Our properties include stand-alone
facilities that provide one level of service, combination facilities that
provide multiple levels of service, and communities or campuses that provide a
wide range of services.



Independent
Living Facilities.Independent living facilities are
age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining facilities that
provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping,
linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities.



Continuing
Care Retirement Communities.Continuing care retirement communities
include a combination of detached homes, an independent living facility, an
assisted living facility and/or a skilled nursing facility on one campus. These
communities are appealing to residents because there is no need for relocating
when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans vary, but can
include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental fees. Many of these
communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit,
meals and some health services.



Assisted
Living Facilities.  Assisted living facilities are state regulated rental
properties that provide the same services as independent living facilities, but
also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require
assistance with activities of daily living, including management of
medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating.



Alzheimer’s/Dementia
Care Facilities.Certain assisted living facilities may include
state licensed settings that specialize in caring for those afflicted with
Alzheimer’s disease and/or other types of dementia.



Skilled
Nursing/Post-Acute Facilities.  Skilled nursing/post-acute facilities are
licensed daily rate or rental properties where the majority of individuals
require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are
licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement and are subject to
triple-net operating leases.  All facilities offer some level of rehabilitation
services.  Some facilities offer rehabilitation units specializing in cardiac,
orthopedic, dialysis, neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation, which focus on
higher acuity patients.



Our seniors housing triple-net
segment accounted for 45%, 57% and 67% of total revenues (including
discontinued operations and our pro rata share of unconsolidated entities) for
the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  We lease 150
facilities to Genesis HealthCare, LLC pursuant to a long-term, triple-net
master lease.  In addition to rent, the master lease requires Genesis to pay
all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, building repairs,
maintenance costs and all obligations under the ground leases.  All obligations
under the master lease have been guaranteed by FC-GEN Operations Investment, LLC. 
For the year ended December 31, 2011, our lease with Genesis accounted for
approximately 26% of our seniors housing triple-net segment revenues and 12% of
our total revenues.



Seniors
Housing Operating



Our seniors
housing operating properties include independent living facilities, assisted
living facilities, Alzheimer’s facilities and combinations thereof. 
Descriptions of these facility types are provided above under Seniors Housing
Triple-Net.  We invest in seniors housing operating real estate primarily
through acquisitions. Properties are primarily held in consolidated entities with
operating partners, structured to take advantage of the REIT Investment
Diversification Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”).  Our properties include stand-alone
facilities that provide one level of service, combination facilities that
provide multiple levels of service, and communities or campuses that provide a
wide range of services.



Our seniors housing operating
segment accounted for 31%, 7% and 0% of total revenues (including discontinued
operations and our pro rata share of unconsolidated entities) for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  We have partnerships
with Merrill Gardens LLC, Benchmark Senior Living, LLC and Silverado Senior
Living, Inc. to own and operate portfolios of 48, 34 and 19 facilities,
respectively.  In each instance, our partner provides management services to
the properties pursuant to an incentive-based management contract.  We rely on
our partners to effectively and efficiently manage these properties.  The
following table provides information about our seniors housing operating
concentration for the year ended December 31, 2011:

Medical Facilities



Our medical
facilities include medical office buildings, hospitals and life science buildings. 
Our medical office buildings are typically leased to multiple tenants and
generally require a certain level of property management. Our hospital
investments are typically structured similar to our seniors housing triple-net investments. 
Our life science investments represent investments in an unconsolidated joint
venture entity (see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements).



Medical
Office Buildings.  The medical office building portfolio consists of health
care related buildings that include physician offices, ambulatory surgery
centers, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services and/or labs. Our portfolio
has a strong affiliation with health systems: Approximately 87% of our medical
office building portfolio is affiliated with health systems by having buildings
on hospital campuses or serving as satellite locations for the health system
and their physicians.



Hospitals. 
Our hospitals generally include acute care hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation
hospitals, and long-term acute care hospitals. Acute care hospitals provide a
wide range of inpatient and outpatient services, including, but not limited to,
surgery, rehabilitation, therapy and clinical laboratories. Inpatient
rehabilitation hospitals provide inpatient services for patients with intensive
rehabilitation needs. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services
for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care,
monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing
facilities.



Life Science
Buildings.  The life science building portfolio consists of laboratory and
office facilities specifically designed and constructed for use by
biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.  These facilities, located adjacent
to The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which is a well established
market known for pharmaceutical and biotechnology research, are similar to
commercial office buildings with advanced HVAC, ventilation, electrical and
mechanical systems.



Our medical facilities segment
accounted for 24%, 35% and 33% of total revenues (including discontinued
operations and our pro rata share of unconsolidated entities) for the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Investments



We invest in
seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions and
developments. For additional information regarding acquisition and development
activity, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.  We
diversify our investment portfolio by property type, customer and geographic
location. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the
following: (1) the experience of the obligor’s management team;
(2) the historical and projected financial and operational performance of
the property; (3) the credit of the obligor; (4) the security for the
lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the building and its location;
and (6) the capital committed to the property by the obligor. We conduct
market research and analysis for all potential investments. In addition, we
review the value of all properties, the interest rates and covenant
requirements of any facility-level debt to be assumed by us at the time of the
acquisition and the anticipated sources of repayment of any of the obligor’s existing
debt that is not to be assumed by us at the time of the acquisition.



We monitor our investments through a variety of methods
determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors
housing triple-net properties generally includes review of monthly financial
statements and other operating data for each property, periodic review of
obligor creditworthiness, periodic property inspections and review of covenant
compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and
other collateral. Our internal property management division actively manages
and monitors the medical office building portfolio with a comprehensive process
including tenant relations, tenant lease expirations, the mix of health service
providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital
improvement needs and market conditions among other things. In monitoring our
portfolio, our personnel use a proprietary database to collect and analyze
property-specific data. Additionally, we conduct extensive research to
ascertain industry trends and risks.



Through asset management and research, we evaluate the
operating environment in each property’s market to determine whether payment
risk is likely to increase. When we identify unacceptable levels of payment
risk, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. We categorize the
risk as obligor, property or market risk. For obligor risk, we typically find a
substitute operator/tenant to run the property. For property risk, we usually
work with the operator/tenant to institute property-level management changes to
address the risk. Finally, for market risk, we often encourage an obligor to
change its capital structure, including refinancing the property or raising
additional equity. Through these asset management and research efforts, we are
generally able to intervene at an early stage to address payment risk, and in
so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our
investment.



Depending upon market conditions, we believe that new
investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of
capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders.
















Investment Types



Real Property.Our
properties are primarily comprised of land, building, improvements and related
rights.  Our hospitals and seniors housing triple-net properties are generally
leased to operators under long-term operating leases.  The leases generally
have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more
five to 15-year renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase
options.  Most of our rents are received under triple-net leases requiring the
operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of
the leased property. The tenants are required to repair, rebuild and maintain
the leased properties. Substantially all of these operating leases are designed
with either fixed or contingent escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed
annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over
the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income
related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based
on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.



At December 31, 2011, approximately 93% of our hospitals
and seniors housing triple-net properties were subject to master leases. A
master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a
single lease agreement. From time to time, we may acquire additional properties
that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The tenant is
required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties
that are subject to the master lease. Typically, the master lease tenant can
exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only
with respect to all leased properties at the same time. This bundling feature
benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to the
better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect
to the poorer performing properties. This spreads our risk among the entire
group of properties within the master lease. The bundling feature should provide
a similar advantage if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy. Subject to
certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject
each of its leases. It is our intent that a tenant in bankruptcy would be
required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than deciding
on a property by property basis.



Our medical office building portfolio is primarily
self-managed and consists principally of multi-tenant properties leased to
health care providers. Our leases have favorable lease terms that typically
include fixed increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by
the tenant. As of December 31, 2011, 86.6% of our portfolio included leases
with full pass through, 11.6% with a partial expense reimbursement (modified
gross) and 1.8% with no expense reimbursement (gross). Our medical office
building leases are non-cancellable operating leases that have a weighted
average remaining term of 8.4 years at December 31, 2011 and are often credit
enhanced by guaranties and/or letters of credit.



Construction.We
currently provide for the construction of properties for tenants generally as
part of long-term operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs
associated with funds used to pay for the construction of properties owned by
us. The amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the
construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our cost of
financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. We also
typically charge a transaction fee at the commencement of construction which we
defer and amortize to income over the term of the resulting lease. The
construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of
the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period.
During the construction period, we advance funds to the tenants in accordance
with agreed upon terms and conditions which require, among other things,
periodic site visits by a Company representative. During the construction
period, we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of
payment and performance bonds and/or completion guaranties. At December 31,
2011, we had outstanding construction investments of $189,502,000 and were
committed to providing additional funds of approximately $282,899,000 to
complete construction for investment properties.



Real Estate Loans.Our real estate loans are typically structured to provide us
with interest income, principal amortization and transaction fees and are
generally secured by a first, second or third mortgage lien, leasehold
mortgage, corporate guaranties and/or personal guaranties. At December 31,
2011, we had outstanding real estate loans of $292,507,000. The interest yield
averaged approximately 9% per annum on our outstanding real estate loan
balances. Our yield on real estate loans depends upon a number of factors,
including the stated interest rate, average principal amount outstanding during
the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. The real estate loans
outstanding at December 31, 2011 are generally subject to three to 20-year
terms with principal amortization schedules and/or balloon payments of the
outstanding principal balances at the end of the term. Typically, real estate
loans are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate
loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its
affiliates.



Principles
of Consolidation



The consolidated financial statements include the
accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we
control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.



At inception of the joint venture transactions, we
identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting
rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business
enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A variable interest
entity is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity
investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or
(ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that
entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support. We
consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary
beneficiary.  Accounting Standards










Codification (“ASC”)
810 requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining
whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated on a continuous basis. This
evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the
activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact that
entity’s economic performance.



For investments in joint ventures, we evaluate the type
of rights held by the limited partner(s), which may preclude consolidation in
circumstances in which the sole general partner would otherwise consolidate the
limited partnership. The assessment of limited partners' rights and their
impact on the presumption of control over a limited partnership by the sole
general partner should be made when an investor becomes the sole general partner and should be reassessed if (i) there is a change to the terms or in the
exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, (ii) the sole
generalpartner increases or decreases its ownership in the limited partnership interests, or
(iii) there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding
limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing
members of limited liability companies.



Investments
in Unconsolidated Entities





Borrowing
Policies



We utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments.
Our debt and equity levels are determined by management to maintain a
conservative credit profile. Generally, we intend to issue unsecured, fixed
rate public debt with long-term maturities to approximate the maturities on our
leases and loans. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our unsecured line
of credit arrangement. We replace these borrowings with long-term capital such
as senior unsecured notes, common stock or preferred stock. When terms are
deemed favorable, we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage
indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged
properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a
leveraged basis. In our agreements with our lenders, we are subject to
restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness.



Competition



We compete with
other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, private equity
and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance/investment
companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds,
health care operators, developers and other investors in the acquisition,
development, leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing
properties. Some of our competitors are larger with greater resources and lower
costs of capital than us. Increased competition inhibits our ability to
identify and successfully complete investments. We compete for investments
based on a number of factors including rates, financings offered, underwriting
criteria and reputation. Our ability to successfully compete is also impacted
by economic and population trends, availability of acceptable investment
opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms,
availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and new and
existing laws and regulations.



The
operators/tenants of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with
operators/tenants of properties that provide comparable services.
Operators/tenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of
factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of
properties, services offered, family preferences, physicians, staff and price.
We also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants, such as
physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities
and services.

Certain Government
Regulations



Health
Law Matters — Generally



Typically, operators of seniors housing facilities do
not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely
subject to state laws, as opposed to federal laws. Operators of skilled nursing
facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government
programs, and these facilities are subject to the federal and state laws that
regulate the type and quality of the medical and/or nursing care provided,
ancillary services (

e.g.

, respiratory, occupational, physical and
infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing
staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate
setting and operating policies.  In addition, as described below, operators of
these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to
health care fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, the Federal Anti-kickback
Statute, the Federal Stark Law, and the Federal False Claims Act, as well as
comparable state law counterparts.  Hospitals, physician group practice
clinics, and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are
subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure, registration,
certification, and inspection laws, regulations, and industry standards. Our
tenants’ failure to comply with any of these, and other, laws could result in
loss of accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines;
suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state health care
programs; loss of license; or closure of the facility.



Licensing
and Certification



The primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities
with assisted living are state licensing and registration laws. In granting and
renewing these licenses, the state regulatory agencies consider numerous
factors relating to a property’s physical plant and operations including, but
not limited to, admission and discharge standards, staffing, and training. A
decision to grant or renew a license is also affected by a property owner’s
record with respect to patient and consumer rights, medication guidelines, and
rules.  Certain of the seniors housing facilities mortgaged to or owned by us
may require the resident to pay an entrance or upfront fee, a portion of which
may be refundable.  These entrance fee communities are subject to significant
state regulatory oversight, including, for example, oversight of each
facility’s financial condition; establishment and monitoring of reserve
requirements, and other financial restrictions; the right of residents to
cancel their contracts within a specified period of time; lien rights in favor
of residents; restrictions on change of ownership; and similar matters.  Such
oversight, and the rights of residents within these entrance fee communities,
may have an effect on the revenue or operations of the operators of such
facilities, and, therefore, may adversely affect us.



Certain health care facilities are subject to a
variety of licensure and certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations. 
Where applicable, CON laws generally require, among other requirements, that a
facility demonstrate the need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding
beds or expanding an existing facility, (3) investing in major capital
equipment or adding new services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an
existing licensed facility, or (5) terminating services that have been
previously approved through the CON process.  Certain state CON laws and
regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or
expand an existing facility’s size or services. In addition, CON laws may
constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a
particular facility to a new operator.  If we have to replace a property
operator who is excluded from participating in a federal or state health care
program (as discussed below), our ability to replace the operator may be
affected by a particular state’s CON laws, regulations, and applicable guidance
governing changes in provider control.












With respect to licensure,
generally our skilled nursing facilities and acute care facilities are required
to be licensed and certified for participation in Medicare, Medicaid, and other
federal health care programs.  This generally requires license renewals and
compliance surveys on an annual or bi-annual basis. The failure of our
operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as
well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified
in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations
at a property.  In addition, if a property is found to be out of compliance
with Medicare, Medicaid, or other health care program conditions of
participation, the property operator may be excluded from participating in
those government health care programs.  Any such occurrence may impair an
operators’ ability to meet their financial obligations to us.  If we have to
replace an excluded property operator, our ability to replace the operator may
be affected by federal and state laws, regulations, and applicable guidance
governing changes in provider control. This may result in payment delays, an inability
to find a replacement operator, a significant working capital commitment from
us to a new operator or other difficulties.



Reimbursement



Seniors Housing Facilities.Approximately 53% of our overall revenues
for the year ended December 31, 2011 were attributable to seniors housing facilities. 
The majority of the revenues received by the operators of our seniors housing facilities
are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue source is primarily
Medicaid under certain waiver programs. As a part of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (“OBRA”) of 1981, Congress established a waiver program
enabling some states to offer Medicaid reimbursement to assisted living providers
as an alternative to institutional long-term care services. The provisions of
OBRA and the subsequent OBRA Acts of 1987 and 1990 permit states to seek a
waiver from typical Medicaid requirements to develop cost-effective
alternatives to long-term care, including Medicaid payments for assisted living
and home health. As of December 31, 2011, seven of our 38 seniors housing operators
received Medicaid reimbursement pursuant to Medicaid waiver programs. For the
twelve months ended September 30, 2011, approximately 5% of the revenues
at our seniors housing facilities were from Medicaid reimbursement. There can
be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver
will be able to maintain its waiver status.



Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the
facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs.
Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay
resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of
care. The level of Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state.  Thus,
the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be
adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level, changes in Medicaid eligibility,
and reimbursement levels.  In addition, a state could lose its Medicaid waiver
and no longer be permitted to utilize Medicaid dollars to reimburse for
assisted living services. Changes in revenues could in turn have a material
adverse effect on an operator’s ability to meet its obligations to us.



Skilled Nursing Facilities and Hospitals.



Medicare Reimbursement and Skilled Nursing Facilities.For the twelve months ended September 30,
2011, approximately 32% of the revenues at our skilled nursing facilities
(which comprised 22% of our overall revenues for the year ended December 31,
2011) were paid by Medicare. Skilled nursing facilities are reimbursed
under the Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective Payment System (“SNF
PPS”). There is a risk that some skilled nursing facilities’ costs will exceed
the fixed payments under the SNF PPS, and there is also a risk that payments
under the SNF PPS may be set below the costs to provide certain items and
services, which could result in immediate financial difficulties for skilled
nursing facilities, and could cause operators to seek bankruptcy protection. Skilled
nursing facilities have faced these types of difficulties since the
implementation of the SNF PPS.












The Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”), an agency of the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”), made a negative
payment update for skilled nursing facilities for fiscal year 2012.  For fiscal
year 2012, skilled nursing facilities received an 11.1% decrease, or $3.87
billion, in RUG payments, resulting from a 2.7% market basket update less a 1%
multi-factor productivity adjustment and a 12.6% reduction, or $4.47 billion,
to recalibrate the RUGs-IV therapy payment rates. CMS announced that the
reasons for this rate reduction were to correct for the unintended spike in
payment levels, particularly those associated with higher paying RUGs, and to
align reimbursement with cost. In addition, on November 21, 2011, the Joint
Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, which was created by the Budget Control
Act of 2011, concluded its work, and issued a statement that it was not able to
make a bipartisan agreement, thus triggering the sequestration process.  The
sequestration process will result in spending reductions starting in 2013,
including Medicare cuts.



In addition, Section 5008 of the Deficit
Reduction Act of 2005 directed the Secretary of HHS to conduct a Post Acute
Care Payment Reform Demonstration (“PAC-PRD”) program, for a three year period,
beginning January 1, 2008, to assess the costs and outcomes of patients
discharged from hospitals in a variety of post-acute care settings, including
skilled nursing facilities. The demonstration program’s results and
recommendations were reported to Congress in a January 2012 report.  The
results and recommendations could lead to future changes in Medicare coverage,
reimbursement, and reporting requirements for post-acute care.



The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 mandated caps on
Medicare reimbursement for certain therapy services. However, Congress imposed
various moratoriums on the implementation of those caps. For 2012, the annual
payment cap of $1,880 per patient applies to occupational therapy and a
separate $1,880 cap applies to speech and physical therapy. Congress has
permitted patients exceeding the cap to obtain additional Medicare coverage
through a waiver program if the therapy is deemed medically necessary. The
waiver program was historically extended and was most recently extended through
February 29, 2012 by the Temporary Payroll Tax Cut Continuation Act of 2011.



If the exception expires, patients will need to use
private funds to pay for the cost of therapy above the caps.  If patients are
unable to satisfy their out-of-pocket cost responsibility to reimburse an
operator for services rendered, the operator’s ability to meet its financial
obligations to us could be adversely impacted.



Medicare Reimbursement and Hospitals.For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2011, approximately 52% of the revenues at our hospitals
(which comprised 5% of our overall revenues for the year ended December 31,
2011) were from Medicare reimbursements. Hospitals, generally, are
reimbursed by Medicare under the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System
(“PPS”), the Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System (“OPPS”), the Long
Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System (“LTCH PPS”), or the Inpatient
Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System (“IRF PPS”). Acute care
hospitals provide a wide range of inpatient and outpatient services including,
but not limited to, surgery, rehabilitation, therapy, and clinical laboratory
services. Long-term acute care hospitals provide inpatient services for
patients with medical conditions that are often complex and that require more
intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than that available in most
skilled nursing facilities. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities provide
intensive rehabilitation services in an inpatient setting for patients
requiring at least three hours of rehabilitation services a day.



With respect to Medicare’s PPS for regular hospitals,
reimbursement for inpatient services is made on the basis of a fixed,
prospective rate, based on the principal diagnosis of the patient.  Hospitals
may be at risk to the extent that their costs in treating a specific case
exceed the fixed payment amount. The diagnosis related group (“DRG”)
reimbursement system was updated in 2008 to expand the number of DRGs from 538
to 745 in order to better distinguish more severe conditions. One additional
DRG was added in 2009, for a new total of 746. In some cases, a hospital might
be able to qualify for an outlier payment if the hospital’s losses exceed a
threshold.



President Obama’s proposed budget for fiscal year
2013, which begins October 1, 2012, was released on February 13, 2012 and has
the potential to further impact Medicare reimbursement rates by proposing to
cut Medicare reimbursement to a host of providers, including hospitals, home
health agencies, and nursing homes.  These proposals, if implemented, could
adversely affect our operators and tenants.



Medicaid Reimbursement.Medicaid is a major payor source for residents
in our skilled nursing facilities and hospitals. For the twelve months ended
September 30, 2011, approximately 48% of the revenues of our skilled
nursing facilities and 11% of the revenues of our hospitals were attributable to
Medicaid reimbursement payments. The federal and state governments share
responsibility for financing Medicaid. The federal matching rate, known as the
Federal Medical Assistance Percentage (“FMAP”), varies by state based on
relative per capita income, but is at least 50% in all states. On average,
Medicaid is the largest component of total state spending, representing
approximately 21% of total state spending. The percentage of Medicaid dollars
used for long-term care varies from state to state, due in part to different
ratios of elderly population and eligibility requirements. Within certain
federal guidelines, states have a fairly wide range of discretion to determine
eligibility and reimbursement methodology.  Many states reimburse long-term
care facilities using fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based
on patient acuity and the historical










costs incurred in
providing patient care. Reasonable costs typically include allowances for
staffing, administrative and general expenses, property, and equipment (e.g.,
real estate taxes, depreciation and fair rental).





The Medicare Part D drug benefit became effective
January 1, 2006. Since that date, low-income Medicare beneficiaries
(eligible for both Medicare and full Medicaid benefits), including those
nursing home residents who are dually eligible for both programs, may enroll
and receive outpatient prescription drugs under Medicare, not Medicaid.
Medicare Part D has resulted in increased administrative responsibilities
for nursing home operators because enrollment in Medicare Part D is
voluntary and residents must choose between multiple prescription drug plans. 
Operators may also experience increased expenses to the extent that a particular
drug prescribed to a patient is not listed on the Medicare Part D drug
plan formulary for the plan in which the patient is enrolled.



The reimbursement methodologies applied to health care
facilities continue to evolve.  Federal and state authorities have considered
and may seek to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may
negatively impact health care property operations.  The impact of any such
changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our skilled
nursing and hospital property operations. No assurance can be given that
current revenue sources or levels will be maintained.  Accordingly, there can
be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are
currently, or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property
operators for their operating and capital expenses.  As a result, an operator’s
ability to meet its financial obligations to us could be adversely impacted.



Finally,the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) and the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010, which amends the PPACA (collectively, the “Health
Reform Laws”) (further discussed below)may have a significant impact on
Medicare, Medicaid, other federal health care programs, and private insurers,
which impact the reimbursement amounts received by skilled nursing facilities
and other health care providers. The Health Reform Laws could have a
substantial and material adverse effect on all parties directly or indirectly
involved in the health care system.



Other
Related Laws





All health care providers, including, but not limited
to skilled nursing facilities and hospitals (and seniors housing facilities that
receives Medicaid payments) are also subject to the Federal Anti-kickback
Statute, which generally prohibits persons from offering, providing,
soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce either the referral of an
individual or the furnishing of a good or service for which payment may be made
under a federal health care program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Skilled
nursing facilities and hospitals are also subject to the Federal Ethics in
Patient Referral Act of 1989, commonly referred to as the Stark Law. The Stark
Law generally prohibits the submission of claims to Medicare for payment if the
claim results from a physician referral for certain designated services and the
physician has a financial relationship with the health service provider that
does not qualify under one of










the exceptions for a
financial relationship under the Stark Law. Similar prohibitions on physician
self-referrals and submission of claims apply to state Medicaid programs.
Further, health care providers, including, but not limited to, skilled nursing
facilities and hospitals (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid
payments), are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil
Monetary Penalties Act and the Federal False Claims Act and, in particular,
actions under the Federal False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” provisions.
Private enforcement of health care fraud has increased due in large part to
amendments to the Federal False Claims Act that encourage private individuals
to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits brought by
private individuals, known as qui tam actions, may be filed by almost anyone,
including present and former patients, nurses and other employees.  Such
whistleblower actions have been brought against nursing facilities on the basis
of the alleged failure of the nursing facility to meet applicable regulations
relating to its operations.  Significantly, if a claim is successfully
adjudicated, the Federal False Claims Act provides for treble damages up to
$11,000 per claim.



Prosecutions, investigations, or whistleblower actions
could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity,
financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability
of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us.  Finally, various
state false claim act and anti-kickback laws may also apply to each property
operator. Violation of any of the foregoing statutes can result in criminal and/or
civil penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an
operator to meet its financial obligations to us.



Other legislative developments, including the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), have greatly
expanded the definition of health care fraud and related offenses and broadened
its scope to include private health care plans in addition to government
payors. Congress also has greatly increased funding for the Department of
Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Office of the Inspector
General of the Department of Health and Human Services to audit, investigate
and prosecute suspected health care fraud.  Moreover, a significant portion of
the billions in health care fraud recoveries over the past several years has
also been returned to government agencies to further fund their fraud
investigation and prosecution efforts.



Additionally, other HIPAA provisions and regulations
provide for communication of health information through standard electronic
transaction formats and for the privacy and security of health information. In
order to comply with the regulations, health care providers often must
undertake significant operational and technical implementation efforts. 
Operators also may face significant financial exposure if they fail to maintain
the privacy and security of medical records and other personal health
information about individuals. The Health Information Technology for Economic
and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act, passed in February 2009, strengthened the
HHS Secretary’s authority to impose civil money penalties for HIPAA violations
occurring after February 18, 2009. HITECH directs the HHS Secretary to
provide for periodic audits to ensure covered entities and their business associates
(as that term is defined under HIPAA) comply with the applicable HITECH
requirements, increasing the likelihood that a HIPAA violation will result in
an enforcement action. CMS issued an interim Final Rule which conformed HIPAA
enforcement regulations to the HITECH Act, increasing the maximum penalty for
multiple violations of a single requirement or prohibition to
$1.5 million.  Higher penalties may accrue for violations of multiple
requirements or prohibitions.  HIPAA violations are also potentially subject to
criminal penalties.



In November 2002, CMS began an ongoing national
Nursing Home Quality Initiative (“NHQI”). Under this initiative, historical
survey information, the NHQI Pilot Evaluation Report and the NHQI Overview is
made available to the public on-line. The NHQI website provides consumer and
provider information regarding the quality of care in nursing homes. The data
allows consumers, providers, states, and researchers to compare quality
information that shows how well nursing homes are caring for their residents’
physical and clinical needs. The posted nursing home quality measures come from
resident assessment data that nursing homes routinely collect on the residents
at specified intervals during their stay. If the operators of nursing
facilities are unable to achieve quality of care ratings that are comparable or
superior to those of their competitors, they may lose market share to other
facilities, reducing their revenues and adversely impacting their ability to
make rental payments.



Finally, government investigations and enforcement
actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically
over the past several years and are expected to continue. Some of these
enforcement actions represent novel legal theories and expansions in the
application of the Federal False Claims Act. The costs for an operator of a
health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions
and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could
have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its
obligations to us.



Taxation



Federal
Income Tax Considerations



The following summary of the taxation of the Company
and the material federal tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity
securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary
does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types
of holders of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance
companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers,
persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated
conversion, or










constructive sale transaction or a
straddle, traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting
for their securities, investors in pass-through entities and foreign
corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the United
States).



This summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular
investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss
any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other tax
consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax
law. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including
changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied
retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth
in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your
own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local,
foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our
securities.



General



We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment
trust (a “REIT”) commencing with our first taxable year. We intend to continue
to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there is no guarantee
that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for subsequent years.
Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety
of qualification tests imposed under federal income tax law with respect to
income, assets, distribution level and diversity of share ownership as
discussed below under “— Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no
assurance that we will be owned and organized and will operate in a manner so
as to qualify or remain qualified.



In any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general,
we will not be subject to federal income tax on that portion of our REIT
taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may,
however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or
capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our
net long-term capital gain, stockholders are required to include their
proportionate share of our undistributed long-term capital gain in income, but
they will receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us
on such gain.



Despite the REIT election, we may be subject to
federal income and excise tax as follows:



•     To the extent that we do not distribute all of
our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT
taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed
amount at regular corporate tax rates;



•     We may be subject to the “alternative minimum
tax” (the “AMT”) on certain tax preference items to the extent that the AMT
exceeds our regular tax;



•     If we have net income from the sale or other
disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to
customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income
from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate
rate;



•     Any net income from prohibited transactions
(which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily
for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than
dispositions of foreclosure property and dispositions of property due to an
involuntary conversion) will be subject to a 100% tax;



•     If we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95%
gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our
qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be
subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross income
attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount
of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (discussed
below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross
income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (discussed below) multiplied
by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;



•     If we fail to distribute during each year at
least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year,
(2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than
capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any
undistributed taxable income from preceding periods, we will be subject to a 4%
excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually
distributed; and



•     We will be subject to a 100% tax on the amount
of any rents from real property, deductions or excess interest paid to us by
any of our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that would be reduced through
reallocation under certain federal income tax principles in order to more
clearly reflect income of the taxable REIT subsidiary. See
“— Qualification as a REIT — Investments in Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries.”



•     We may be subject to the corporate “alternative
minimum tax” on any items of tax preference, including any deductions of net
operating losses.














Qualification
as a REIT



A REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or
association:



(1)     which is managed by one or more trustees or
directors;



(2)     the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced
by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;



(3)     which would be taxable as a domestic
corporation but for the federal income tax law relating to REITs;



(4)     which is neither a financial institution nor
an insurance company;



(5)     the beneficial ownership of which is held by
100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first
taxable year;



(6)     not more than 50% in value of the outstanding
stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding
its first taxable year, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer
individuals (which includes certain entities) (the “Five or Fewer
Requirement”); and



(7)     which meets certain income and asset tests
described below.



Conditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met
during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at
least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a
proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes
of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt
entities are treated as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception in
the case of condition (6).



Based on publicly available information, we believe we
have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in (5) and
(6) above. In addition, Article VI of our by-laws provides for
restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are
intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements
described in (5) and (6) above. These restrictions, however, may not
ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy the share ownership
requirements described in (5) and (6) above.



We have complied with, and will continue to comply
with, regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders
requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If, despite
sending the annual letters, we do not know, or after exercising reasonable
diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer
Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer Requirement. If
we fail to comply with these regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary
penalty. If our failure to comply was due to intentional disregard of the
requirement, the penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply
were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty would be
imposed.



We may own a number of properties through wholly owned
subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified REIT subsidiary” if
100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the
subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will not
be treated as a separate corporation, and all assets, liabilities and items of
income, deductions and credits of a “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated
as assets, liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT. A “qualified
REIT subsidiary” is not subject to federal income tax, and our ownership of the
voting stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions
against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than
10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5% of the
value of our total assets, as described below under “— Asset Tests.”












If we invest in a partnership, a limited liability
company or a trust taxed as a partnership or as a disregarded entity, we will
be deemed to own a proportionate share of the partnership’s, limited liability
company’s or trust’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving our
share of the income and loss of the partnership, limited liability company or
trust, and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it
has in the hands of the partnership, limited liability company or trust. These
“look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests
described below.



Income Tests.There
are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that
we must satisfy for each taxable year.



•     At least 75% of our gross income (excluding
gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be
directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real
property,” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages
on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.



•     At least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross
income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) must be directly
or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for
the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including dividends from taxable
REIT subsidiaries) and interest.



As to transactions entered into in taxable years
beginning after October 22, 2004, any of our income from a “clearly
identified” hedging transaction that is entered into by us in the normal course
of business, directly or indirectly, to manage the risk of interest rate
movements, price changes or currency fluctuations with respect to borrowings or
obligations incurred or to be incurred by us, or such other risks that are
prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service, is excluded from the 95% gross
income test.



For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction that is
entered into by us in the normal course of business, directly or indirectly, to
manage the risk of interest rate movements, price changes or currency
fluctuations with respect to borrowings or obligations incurred or to be
incurred by us is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.



For transactions entered into after July 30,
2008, any of our income from a “clearly identified” hedging transaction entered
into by us primarily to manage risk of currency fluctuations with respect to
any item of income or gain that is included in gross income in the 95% and 75%
gross income tests is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests.



In general, a hedging transaction is “clearly
identified” if (1) the transaction is identified as a hedging transaction
before the end of the day on which it is entered into and (2) the items or
risks being hedged are identified “substantially contemporaneously” with the
hedging transaction. An identification is not substantially contemporaneous if
it is made more than 35 days after entering into the hedging transaction.





Generally, other than income from “clearly identified”
hedging transactions entered into by us in the normal course of business, any
foreign currency gain derived by us from dealing, or engaging in substantial
and regular trading, in securities will constitute gross income which does not
qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests.



Rents received by us will qualify as “rents from real
property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if
several conditions are met:



•     The amount of rent must not be based in whole or
in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will
not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages
of receipts or sales.












•     Rents received from a tenant will not qualify as
rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT,
also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the
tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met
with respect to the real property being rented.



•     If rent attributable to personal property leased
in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total
rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such
personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.”



•     For rents to qualify as rents from real
property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other
than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom
we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are
“usually or customarily rendered” in the geographic area in which the property
is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only,
or are not otherwise considered “rendered to the occupant for his convenience.”



•     For taxable years beginning after July 30, 2008,
the REIT may lease“qualified
health careproperties”on an
arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on
behalf of such subsidiary by a person whoqualifies as an
“independent contractor” and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively
engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any
person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary, an “eligible independent contractor.”Generally, the rent that the REIT
receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary will be treated as “rents from real
property.”A “qualified health care property” includes any real
property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to
the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate
care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility
which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and which is
operated by a provider of such services which is eligible for participation in
the Medicare program with respect to such facility.



A REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of
impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect
to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by
the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to
a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT
directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service
or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than
150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or
providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may
be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain
conditions, and we may still treat rents received with respect to the property
as rent from real property.



The term “interest” generally does not
include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in
part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will
not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a
fixed percentage of receipts or sales.



If we fail to satisfy one or both of
the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless
qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible for relief.  These relief
provisions generally will be available if (1) following our identification
of the failure, we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item
of our gross income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect.



It is not now possible to determine
the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an amount
equal to (a) the gross income attributable to (1) 75% of our gross
income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75%
income test and (2) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying
gross income for purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (b) a
fraction intended to reflect our profitability.



The Secretary of the Treasury is given
broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify
or not under the 75% and 95% gross income tests, or are to be excluded from the
measure of gross income for such purposes.



Asset Tests.Within 30 days after
the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several
tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the
value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets, cash, cash
items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation),
government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the
remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we
are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the
vote (the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value test”) of the outstanding
securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT
or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than 25% of the total assets may
be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the “25%
asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be
represented by securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified
REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or a taxable REIT
subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and the 25% and 5%
asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each










quarter.
There are special rules which provide relief if the value related tests are not
satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.



Certain items are excluded from the
10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities of an issuer
(including straight debt that provides certain contingent payments);
(2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any rental agreement
described in Section 467 of the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a
“related person”; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property;
(5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof, the
District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any political subdivision
thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a
REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary
of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security (“excluded
securities”). Special rules apply to straight debt securities issued by
corporations and entities taxable as partnerships for federal income tax
purposes. If a REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight
debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and (2) securities of
such issuer that are not excluded securities and have an aggregate value
greater than 1% of such issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt
securities will be included in the 10% value test.



A REIT’s interest as a partner in a
partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value
test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt instrument
issued by a partnership will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10%
value test (1) to the extent of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the
partnership and (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income
(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75%
gross income test.  For purposes of the 10% value test, a REIT’s interest in a
partnership’s assets is determined by the REIT’s proportionate interest in any
securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded securities
described in the preceding paragraph).



For taxable years beginning after July 30,
2008, if the REIT or its QBU uses a foreign currency as its functional
currency, the term “cash” includes such foreign currency, but only to the
extent such foreign currency is (i) held for use in the normal course of
the activities of the REIT or QBU which give rise to items of income or gain
that are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly related
to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and
(ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and
regular trading in securities.



With respect to corrections of
failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5%
asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of
sufficient assets to cure a violation that does not exceed the lesser of 1% of
the REIT’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided
that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the
quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets. For violations of any of
the REIT asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that
exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid
disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain
steps, including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period
described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the
greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net
income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that
the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the
Internal Revenue Service that describes the non-qualifying assets.



Investments in Taxable REIT
Subsidiaries.REITs may own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in
taxable REIT subsidiaries. We and any taxable corporate entity in which we own
an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable
REIT subsidiary.”



Certain of our subsidiaries have
elected to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Taxable REIT subsidiaries
are subject to full corporate level federal taxation on their earnings but are
permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed
directly by REITs without jeopardizing their REIT status. Our taxable REIT
subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can
be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes
will be successful. To the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to
pay federal, state or local taxes, the cash available for distribution as
dividends to us from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.



The amount of interest on
related-party debt that a taxable REIT subsidiary may deduct is limited.
Further, a 100% tax applies to any interest payments by a taxable REIT
subsidiary to its affiliated REIT to the extent the interest rate is not
commercially reasonable. A taxable REIT subsidiary is permitted to deduct interest
payments to unrelated parties without any of these restrictions.



The Internal Revenue Service may
reallocate costs between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is
a lack of arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any deductible expenses
allocated away from a taxable REIT subsidiary would increase its tax liability.
Further, any amount by which a REIT understates its deductions and overstates
those of its taxable REIT subsidiary will, subject to certain exceptions, be
subject to a 100% tax. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may be made
in the future for additional entities in which we own an interest.



Annual Distribution Requirements.In order to avoid being
taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make distributions (other
than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which qualify for the
dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of
(i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the
dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the
after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) a
portion of certain items of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid
in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if
declared before










we timely file our tax return for that
year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such
declaration. The amount distributed must not be preferential. This means that
every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be
treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of
stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a
class. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or
distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as
adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular
corporate tax rates. Finally, as discussed above, we may be subject to an excise
tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements. We intend to
make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution
requirements.



It is possible that, from time to
time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90%
distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be
necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things,
(1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and
actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and
deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the
payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In the event
that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for
borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock
dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement.



Under certain circumstances, in the
event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be
able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a
year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year, which
may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year.
Thus, we may be able to avoid being taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency
dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and
interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend
distributions.



The Internal Revenue Service issued Revenue Procedure
2008-68, which provided temporary relief to publicly traded REITs seeking to
preserve liquidity by electing cash/stock dividends. Under Revenue Procedure
2008-68, a REIT may treat the entire dividend, including the stock portion, as
a taxable dividend distribution, thereby qualifying for the dividends-paid
deduction, provided certain requirements are satisfied. The cash portion of the
dividend may be as low as 10%. Revenue Procedure 2008-68, as amplified by
Revenue Procedure 2010-12, applies to dividends declared on or before
December 31, 2012, and with respect to a taxable year ending on or before
December 31, 2011.



Failure
to Qualify as a REIT



If we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any
taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax, including any
applicable alternative minimum tax, on our taxable income at regular corporate
rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as
a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions
be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be
taxable as ordinary income to the extent of current and accumulated earnings
and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain
limitations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for
corporate stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory
provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four
taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not
possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to
statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need
to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially
significant resulting tax liabilities.



In addition to the relief described above under
“— Income Tests” and “— Asset Tests,” relief is available in the
event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would
result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to
reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of
$50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation
does not include a violation described under “— Income Tests” or
“— Asset Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the
circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief
provisions.



Federal
Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock



Treatment of Taxable U.S. Stockholders.The following summary applies to you only
if you are a “U.S. stockholder.” A “U.S. stockholder” is a holder of
shares of stock who, for United States federal income tax purposes, is:



•     a citizen or resident of the United States;



•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision of the United States, including any state;



•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or



•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.












So long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT,
distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated
earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as
capital gain dividends) will be includable as ordinary income for federal
income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the
dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.



Generally, for taxable years ending after May 6,
2003 through December 31, 2012, the maximum marginal rate of tax payable
by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a
corporate level of tax is 15%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax rate
will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because generally
we are not subject to federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable
income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum
federal income tax rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends
received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to:
(1) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable
REIT subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect to which we
were required to pay federal corporate income tax during the prior year (if,
for example, we did not distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the
prior year); or (3) the amount of any earnings and profits that were
distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.



Distributions that are designated as capital gain
dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not
exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the
period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may
be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary
income.



If we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net
long-term capital gain, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain,
your proportionate share of this net long-term capital gain. You would also
receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by
us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis
of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains
less your share of the tax deemed paid.



You may not include in your federal income tax return
any of our net operating losses or capital losses. Federal income tax rules may
also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be
apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October,
November or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be
treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year,
provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31
of the following year.





Upon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock
to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our
stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally
recognize capital gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount
realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of
our stock. This gain will be capital gain if you held these shares of our stock
as a capital asset.



If we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment
can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of
redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend
income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the
redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such
redemption: (1) results in a “complete termination” of your interest in
all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a “substantially
disproportionate redemption”; or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a
dividend” with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into
account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common
stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take
into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively
owned by you.



If, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares,
you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity
securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial
percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of
your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and,
thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However,










whether
a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of
the facts and circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time
of redemption, you should consult your tax advisor to determine their
application to the particular situation.



Generally, if the redemption does not meet the tests
described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your
shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of
the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the
redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed
shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If
you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis
may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely.



Gain from the sale or exchange of our
shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term
capital gain rate of 15% through 2012 in the case of stockholders who are
individuals and 35% in the case of stockholders that are corporations.  Pursuant
to Internal Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital
gain dividends as gains eligible for the long-term capital gains rate or as
gain taxable to individual stockholders at a maximum rate of 25%.  Capital
losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares held for
more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long term
capital losses, and are generally available only to offset capital gain income
of the stockholder but not ordinary income (except in the case of individuals,
who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).



On March 30,
2010, the President signed into law the Health Care and Education
Reconciliation Act of 2010, which requires U.S. stockholders who meet certain
requirements and are individuals, estates or certain trusts to pay an
additional 3.8% tax on, among other things, dividends on and capital gains from
the sale or other disposition of stock for taxable years beginning after
December 31, 2012. U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding
the effect, if any, of this legislation on their ownership and disposition of
shares of our stock.



Treatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders.Tax-exempt
entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and
individual retirement accounts (“Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt
from federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their
unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The Internal Revenue Service has
issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an
exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares
of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the
exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us
to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an
Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with
debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the
“debt financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of the Exempt
Organization’s income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual
interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit.



In addition, in certain circumstances,
a pension trust that owns more than 10% of our stock is required to treat a
percentage of our dividends as UBTI. This rule applies to a pension trust
holding more than 10% of our stock only if: (1) the percentage of our
income that is UBTI (determined as if we were a pension trust) is at least 5%;
(2) we qualify as a REIT by reason of the modification of the Five or
Fewer Requirement that allows beneficiaries of the pension trust to be treated
as holding shares in proportion to their actuarial interests in the pension
trust; and (3) either (i) one pension trust owns more than 25% of the
value of our stock, or (ii) a group of pension trusts individually holding
more than 10% of the value of our stock collectively own more than 50% of the
value of our stock.



Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.Under certain
circumstances, you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on
payments made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of,
shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you: (1) fail
to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an
individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an
incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal
Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or
dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you
have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal
Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.



Backup withholding will not apply with
respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and
tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding
qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the procedure for
obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather,
the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder
will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s United States federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided
that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service. In
addition, withholding a portion of capital gain distributions made to
stockholders may be required for stockholders who fail to certify their
non-foreign status.



Taxation of Foreign Stockholders.The following summary
applies to you only if you are a foreign person. The federal taxation of
foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many
considerations.



Except as discussed below,
distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the
form of ordinary dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital
assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of
30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the
required form evidencing the lower rate.












In general, you will be subject to
United States federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than
withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is
“effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is, or is
treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or business may
also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in addition to
regular United States corporate income tax. The following discussion will apply
to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected.
We expect to withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the
gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the
distribution is “effectively connected” or (2) certain other exceptions
apply.



Distributions by us that are
attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property
interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax
Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were gains “effectively
connected” with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, you will be
taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a
special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals.
Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax in
the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty
exemption.



We will be required to withhold from distributions
subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 35% of designated
capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 35% of the amount of any distributions
that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we
designate prior distributions as capital gain dividends, subsequent
distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld
against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.



Any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of
stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be
treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more
than 5% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign
stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received
from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions treated
as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such capital
gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (unless
reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In addition,
the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions.



Unless our shares constitute a “United States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively connected with
a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our shares by you generally will not
be subject to United States taxation. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled REIT.” We
believe that we, and expect to continue to, qualify as a domestically
controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times
during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held
directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders. However, if you are a
nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for
183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply,
you will be subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a
purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold
on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an
established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT.
Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 10% of the
purchase price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue Service.



Backup withholding tax and information reporting will
generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States that
are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower treaty rate
withholding tax discussed above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or
(3) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of
U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock
within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related
financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting
unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she
is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge that
the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise established an
exemption. You may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup
withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal
Revenue Service.
















respect of any amounts withheld. Foreign persons are
encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible
implications of the legislation on their investment in shares of our stock.



U.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary
Shares



Owners of our depositary shares will be treated as if
you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary
shares. Thus, you will be required to take into account the income and
deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the underlying
series of preferred stock.



Conversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred Stock.No gain or loss will be recognized upon
the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax
basis of each share of preferred stock will, upon exchange, be the same as the
aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged. If you held your
depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of
preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include
the period during which you owned the depositary shares.



U.S. Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our
Debt Securities



The following is a general summary of the United
States federal income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder
that is a non-U.S. holder, as defined below, the United States federal
estate tax consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt securities
periodically offered under one or more indentures (the “notes”). This summary
assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you
only if you are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes for a
price equal to the issue price of the notes. The issue price of the notes is
the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold other than
to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the
capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this
summary does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax laws that may
be applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.



U.S. Holders



The following summary applies to you only if you are a
  U.S. holder, as defined below.



Definition of a U.S. Holder.A “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner
of a note or notes that is for United States federal income tax purposes:



•     a citizen or resident of the United States;



•     a corporation, partnership or other entity
classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or
organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political
subdivision of the United States, including any state;



•     an estate, the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or



•     a trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is
able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or
more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has
the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.



Payments of Interest.Stated interest on the notes generally
will be taxed as ordinary interest income from domestic sources at the time it
is paid or accrues in accordance with your method of accounting for tax
purposes.



Sale,
Exchange or Other Disposition of Notes.The
adjusted tax basis in your note acquired at a premium will generally be your
cost. You generally will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or
otherwise dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:



•     the amount realized on the sale or other
disposition, less any amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will
be taxable in the manner described under “— Payments of Interest”
above; and



•     your adjusted tax basis in the notes.



Your gain or loss generally will be capital gain or
loss. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if at
the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the notes for more than
one year. Subject to limited exceptions, your capital losses cannot be used to
offset your ordinary income.












Backup Withholding and
Information Reporting.In
general, “backup withholding” may apply to any payments made to you of
principal and interest on your note, and to payment of the proceeds of a sale
or other disposition of your note before maturity, if you are a non-corporate
U.S. holder and: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer
identification number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your
social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification
number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have
failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail
to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct
taxpayer identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified
you that you are subject to backup withholding.



The amount of any reportable payments, including
interest, made to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of
tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be reported to you and
to the Internal Revenue Service for each calendar year. You should consult your
tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup
withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable.
The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be credited
against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that correct
information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service.



Non-U.S.
Holders



The following summary applies to you if you are a
beneficial owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above (a
“non-U.S. holder”).



Special rules may apply to certain
non-U.S. holders such as “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive
foreign investment companies” and “foreign personal holding companies.” Such
entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the United States federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to
them.



U.S. Federal
Withholding Tax.Subject
to the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to
payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, of principal and
interest on your notes under the “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal
Revenue Code, provided that:



•     you do not, directly or indirectly, actually or
constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all
classes of our stock entitled to vote;



•     you are not (1) a controlled foreign
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly
or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as provided in the
Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank receiving interest described in
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code;



•     such interest is not effectively connected with
your conduct of a U.S. trade or business; and



•     you provide a signed written statement, under
penalties of perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that you
are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and
providing your name and address to:



•     us or our paying agent; or



•     a securities clearing organization, bank or
other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary
course of its trade or business and holds your notes on your behalf and that
certifies to us or our paying agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the
bank or financial institution between it and you, has received from you your
signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent with a copy of
such statement.



Treasury regulations provide that:



•     if you are a foreign partnership, the
certification requirement will generally apply to your partners, and you will
be required to provide certain information;



•     if you are a foreign trust, the certification
requirement will generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners
depending on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,” “foreign simple trust,”
or “foreign grantor trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and



•     look-through rules will apply for tiered
partnerships, foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.



If you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust,
you should consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these
Treasury regulations and the certification requirements applicable to you.












If you cannot satisfy the
portfolio interest requirements described above, payments of interest will be
subject to the 30% United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a
properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming an
exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable
treaty or (2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI stating that
interest paid on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is
effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United
States. Alternative documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.



If you are engaged in a trade or business in the
United States and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct
of that trade or business, you will be required to pay United States federal
income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt
from the 30% withholding tax provided the certification requirement described
above is met) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as
otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a foreign
corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits tax on the earnings
and profits that are effectively connected to the conduct of your trade or
business in the United States.



Recently enacted legislation generally will impose
U.S. withholding tax at a 30% rate on payments of interest (including original
issue discount) and proceeds of sale in respect of debt instruments to certain
non-U.S. holders if certain additional disclosure requirements related to U.S.
ownership of such non-U.S. holders or certain U.S. accounts maintained by such
non-U.S. holders at foreign financial institutions are not satisfied. However,
the withholding tax will not be imposed on payments pursuant to debt or other
obligations outstanding as of March 18, 2012.  If payment of withholding taxes
is required, non-U.S. holders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption
from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such
distributions and proceeds of a sale of such notes will be entitled to seek a
refund from the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) to obtain the benefit of such
exemption or reduction. We will not pay any additional amounts to non-U.S.
holders in respect of any amounts withheld. These new withholding rules are
generally effective with respect to payments of interest made after December
31, 2013 and with respect to proceeds of sales received after December 31, 2014.



Sale,
Exchange or other Disposition of Notes.You
generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gain or
income realized from the sale, redemption, retirement at maturity or other
disposition of your notes, unless:



•     in the case of gain, you are an individual who
is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable
year of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific other
conditions are met;



•     you are subject to tax provisions applicable to
certain United States expatriates; or



•     the gain is effectively connected with your
conduct of a U.S. trade or business.



If you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that
trade or business, you generally will be subject to U.S. income tax on a
net basis on the gain. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may
be subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected earnings and
profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.



U.S. Federal
Estate Tax.If you are an
individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States,
as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, at the time of
your death, your notes will generally not be subject to the U.S. federal estate
tax, unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or
constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all our
classes of stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest on the notes is
effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business.



Backup Withholding and Information Reporting.Backup withholding will not apply to
payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying agent, in its
capacity as such, to you if you have provided the required certification that
you are a non-U.S. holder as described in “— U.S. Federal
Withholding Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying agent have
actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as described in
“— U.S. Holders” above. We or our paying agent may, however, report
payments of interest on the notes.



The gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes
may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If you sell
your notes outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker
and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information reporting requirements generally will not
apply to that payment. However, U.S. information reporting, but not backup
withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is
made outside the United States, if you sell your notes through a
non-U.S. office of a broker that:



•     is a U.S. person, as defined in the
Internal Revenue Code;



•     derives 50% or more of its gross income in
specific periods from the conduct of a trade or business in the United States;












•     is a “controlled
foreign corporation” for U.S. federal income tax purposes; or



•     is a foreign partnership, if at any time during
its tax year, one or more of its partners are U.S. persons who in the
aggregate hold more than 50% of the income or capital interests in the
partnership, or the foreign partnership is engaged in a U.S. trade or
business, unless the broker has documentary evidence in its files that you are
a non-U.S. person and certain other conditions are met or you otherwise
establish an exemption. If you receive payments of the proceeds of a sale of
your notes to or through a U.S. office of a broker, the payment is subject
to both U.S. backup withholding and information reporting unless you
provide a Form W-8BEN certifying that you are a non-U.S. person or
you otherwise establish an exemption.



You should consult your own tax advisor regarding
application of backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the
availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup
withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a
payment to you will be allowed as a refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to
the Internal Revenue Service.



U.S. Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our
Warrants



Exercise of Warrants.You will not generally recognize gain or
loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your basis in the debt securities,
preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be,
received upon the exercise of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your
adjusted tax basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding
period in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common
stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of the warrant will not
include the period during which the warrant was held by you.



Expiration of Warrants.Upon the expiration of a warrant, you will
recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis in the
warrant.



Sale or
Exchange of Warrants.Upon
the sale or exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will recognize
gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized
on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain
or loss will be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss
if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of the warrant to
us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that you should recognize ordinary
income on the sale. You are advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the
consequences of a sale of a warrant to us.



Potential
Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax Consequences



Current and prospective securities holders should
recognize that the present federal income tax treatment of an investment in us
may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time
and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously
made. The rules dealing with federal income taxation are constantly under
review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal
Revenue Service and the Treasury Department, resulting in revisions of
regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as
statutory changes. Revisions in federal tax laws and interpretations of these
laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.



State,
Local and Foreign Taxes



We, and holders of our debt and equity securities, may
be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions,
including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside.
It should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state, local
and foreign jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or
all of those jurisdictions. The state, local or foreign tax treatment of us and
holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the U.S. federal
income tax consequences discussed above. Consequently, you are urged to consult
your advisor regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign
tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities.
