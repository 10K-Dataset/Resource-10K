Item 1:Business

THE COMPANY



Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company®, or Realty Income, is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations. Our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to commercial tenants. We have in-house acquisition, leasing, legal, credit research, real estate research, portfolio management (including property and asset management), and capital markets expertise. Over the past 45 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements.



Realty Income was founded in 1969, and in 1994 was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE.  We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).



We seek to increase distributions to stockholders and funds from operations, or FFO, per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties.



Generally, our portfolio management efforts seek to achieve:



·Contractual rent increases on existing leases;

·Rent increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions permit; and

·The active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant properties, and selectively selling properties, thereby mitigating our exposure to certain tenants and markets.



At December 31, 2013, we owned a diversified portfolio:



·Of 3,896 properties;

·With an occupancy rate of 98.2%, or 3,826 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease;

·Leased to 205 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries;

·Located in 49 states and Puerto Rico;

·With over 62.6 million square feet of leasable space; and

·With an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,100 square feet, including approximately 10,600 square feet per retail property.



Of the 3,896 properties in the portfolio, 3,876, or 99.5%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining twenty are multi-tenant properties. At December 31, 2013, of the 3,876 single-tenant properties, 3,807 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.8 years.



In acquiring additional properties, our strategy is primarily to acquire freestanding, single-tenant locations under long-term, net lease agreements.  Our acquisition and investment activities generally focus on businesses providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer and business needs.  In general, our net lease agreements:



·Are for initial terms of 10 to 20 years;

·Require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses (taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

·Provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 45-year policy of paying monthly dividends.  In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2013.



MonthDividendIncrease2013 Dividend increasesPaidper shareper share1st   increaseJan   2013$ 0.1517500$ 0.00031252nd increaseFeb 20130.18091670.02916673rd increaseApr 20130.18122920.00031254th increaseJul 20130.18154170.00031255th increaseOct 20130.18185420.0003125



The dividends paid per share during 2013 as compared to 2012 increased 21.2%, which is the largest annual increase in the company’s history.  The 2013 dividends paid per share totaled $2.1474587 as compared to $1.7716250 in 2012, an increase of $0.3758337.



In December 2013, we declared an increased dividend of $0.1821667 per share, which was paid in January 2014.  The increase in January 2014 was our 65thconsecutive quarterly increase and the 74thincrease in the amount of the dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.  In January 2014 and February 2014, we declared dividends of $0.1821667 per share, which will be paid in February 2014 and March 2014, respectively.



The monthly dividend of $0.1821667 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $2.186 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 5.9% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $37.33 on December 31, 2013. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.

Acquisitions During 2013

During 2013, we invested $1.51 billion in 459 new properties and properties under development or expansion, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.1%. The 459 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 40 states, will contain approximately 9.0 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 14.0 years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 23 industries and the property types consist of 83.8% retail, 9.2% office, 4.9% industrial and distribution, and 2.1% manufacturing, based on rental revenue.  These investments are in addition to the $3.2 billion acquisition of 515 properties of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., or ARCT, which were added to our real estate portfolio during the first quarter of 2013.  Our combined total investment in real estate assets during 2013 was $4.67 billion in 974 new properties and properties under development or expansion.  During 2013, none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at December 31, 2013.



In conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT, each outstanding share of ARCT common stock was converted into the right to receive a combination of: (i) $0.35 in cash and (ii) 0.2874 shares of our common stock, resulting in the issuance of a total of approximately 45.6 million shares of our common stock to ARCT shareholders, valued at a per share amount of $44.04, which was the closing sale price of our common stock on January 22, 2013.  In connection with the closing of this acquisition, we terminated and repaid the amounts then outstanding of approximately $552.9 million under ARCT’s revolving credit facility and term loan.  In connection with our acquisition of ARCT, we assumed approximately $516.3 million of mortgages payable.  We incurred merger costs of $13.0 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in 2013 and 2012.  The total merger costs were approximately $21 million.



Our acquisition of ARCT provided benefits to Realty Income, including accretion to net earnings, growth in the size of our real estate portfolio, diversification of industries and property type, and increase in the percentage of investment grade tenants.



The 515 properties added to our real estate portfolio as a result of the ARCT acquisition, are located in 44 states and Puerto Rico, contain over 16.0 million leasable square feet and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 12.2 years.  The 69 tenants, occupying the 515 properties acquired, operate in 28 industries and the property types consist of 54.0% retail, 32.6% industrial and distribution, and 13.4% office, based on rental revenue.



The estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.



In the case of a property under development or expansion, the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated net operating income (which is calculated by multiplying the capitalization rate determined by the lease by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs) for the first full year of each lease, divided by such projected total investment in the property.  Of the $4.67 billion we invested during 2013, $39.6 million was invested in 21 properties under development or expansion, with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.5%.  We may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.



John P. Case Appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

In September 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors appointed John P. Case as CEO of the company.  Mr. Case, who had previously served as President and Chief Investment Officer, succeeded Tom A. Lewis, who retired as our CEO.  Mr. Lewis had been our CEO since 1997.  Mr. Case is only the third CEO in Realty Income’s 45-year history.

Portfolio Discussion



Leasing Results

At December 31, 2013, we had 70 properties available for lease out of 3,896 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.2% occupancy rate.  Since December 31, 2012, when we reported 84 properties available for lease and a 97.2% occupancy rate, we:



·Leased 27 properties;

·Sold 19 properties available for lease; and

·Have 32 new properties available for lease.



During 2013, 136 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants.  The annual rent on these leases was $16.1 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $16.0 million.  At December 31, 2013, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $13.21 per square foot on the 3,807 leased properties in our portfolio.  At December 31, 2013, we classified 12 properties with a carrying amount of $12.0 million as held for sale on our balance sheet.



Investments in Existing Properties

In 2013, we capitalized costs of $8.5 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.3 million for re-leasing costs and $7.2 million for building and tenant improvements.  In 2012, we capitalized costs of $6.6 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.62 million for re-leasing costs and $4.93 million for building and tenant improvements.



As part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  Leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.



The majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  It is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  The amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.



Amendment to Credit Facility

In October 2013, we amended our credit facility by increasing the borrowing capacity by $500 million to $1.5 billion.  All other material business terms of the credit facility remain unchanged.



Note Issuance

In July 2013, we issued $750 million of 4.65% senior unsecured notes due August 2023, or the 2023 Notes.  The price to the investors for the 2023 Notes was 99.775% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4.678% per annum.  The total net proceeds of approximately $741.4 million from this offering were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including additional property acquisitions.  Interest is paid semiannually on the 2023 Notes.

Accelerated Stock Vesting

The Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors approved, effective July 1, 2013, the accelerated vesting of each restricted stock award that had originally been granted with ten-year vesting to five years.  On July 1, 2013, 212,827 restricted shares vested as a result of this acceleration, resulting in additional compensation expense of $3.7 million during 2013.



Issuance of Common Stock

In October 2013, we issued 9,775,000 shares of common stock at a price of $40.63 per share, including 1,275,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  After underwriting discounts and other estimated offering costs of $18.7 million, the net proceeds of approximately $378.5 million were used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, which were used to fund property acquisitions.



In March 2013, we issued 17,250,000 shares of common stock at a price of $45.90 per share. After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $36.7 million, the net proceeds of $755.1 million were used to redeem our 5.375% notes in March 2013 and repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, which were used to fund property acquisitions, including our acquisition of ARCT.



In connection with our January 2013 acquisition of ARCT, we issued a total of 45,573,144 shares of our common stock to ARCT shareholders and redeemed 208,709 shares of our common stock that were previously held by ARCT.



Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

In March 2011, we established a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, or the DRSPP, to provide our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions.  The DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions.  The DRSPP authorizes up to 6,000,000 common shares to be issued.  During 2013, we issued 1,449,139 shares and raised approximately $55.6 million under the DRSPP.



Note Repayment

In March 2013, we repaid the $100 million of outstanding 5.375% notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, using proceeds from our March 2013 common stock offering and our credit facility.



Term Loan

In January 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing January 21, 2018, to partially repay the then outstanding ARCT term loan.  Borrowing under the term loan bears interest at LIBOR, plus 1.20%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 2.15%.



Noncontrolling Interests

As consideration for two separate acquisitions during 2013, partnership units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P. and Realty Income, L.P. were issued to third parties.  These units (discussed in the following paragraphs below) do not have voting rights, are entitled to monthly distributions equal to the amount paid to our common stockholders, and are redeemable in cash or our common stock, at our option and at a conversion ratio of one to one, subject to certain exceptions.  As the general partner for each of these partnerships, we have operating and financial control over these entities, consolidate them in our financial statements, and record the partnership units held by third parties as noncontrolling interests.



Issuance of Common and Preferred Partnership Units

In connection with our acquisition of ARCT in January 2013, we issued 317,022 common partnership units and 6,750 preferred partnership units.  These common units are entitled to monthly distributions equivalent to the per common share amounts paid to the common stockholders of Realty Income.  The preferred units have a par value of $1,000, and are entitled to monthly payments at a rate of 2% per annum, or $135,000 per year.



In June 2013, we issued 534,546 common partnership units of Realty Income, L.P.  These common units are entitled to monthly distributions equivalent to the per common share amount paid to the common stockholders of Realty Income.



Universal Shelf Registration

In February 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in February 2016. This replaces our prior shelf registration statement.  In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement



-6-








include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.



Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $203.6 million in 2013, compared to $114.5 million in 2012, an increase of $89.1 million. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.06 in 2013, as compared to $0.86 in 2012, an increase of $0.20, or 23.3%.  Net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes $13.0 million of merger-related costs for the acquisition of ARCT, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis, and $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in July 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.  Net income available to common stockholders for 2012 includes $7.9 million of merger-related costs for the acquisition of ARCT, which represents $0.06 on a diluted per common share basis, and a $3.7 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our 7.375% Monthly Income Class D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Class D preferred stock, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis.



The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties. The amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.



Gains from the sale of properties during 2013 were $64.7 million, as compared to gains from the sale of properties of $9.9 million during 2012.



Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO) and Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (Normalized FFO)

In 2013, our FFO increased by $188.1 million, or 72.1%, to $449.0 million versus $260.9 million in 2012.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $2.34 in 2013, compared to $1.96 in 2012, an increase of $0.38, or 19.4%.  FFO in 2013 includes $13.0 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis, and $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in July 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.  FFO for 2012 includes $7.9 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.06 on a diluted per common share basis, and includes a $3.7 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our Class D preferred stock, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis.



We define normalized FFO as FFO excluding the merger-related costs for our acquisition of ARCT.  In 2013, our normalized FFO increased by $193.2 million, or 71.9%, to $462.0 million, versus $268.8 million in 2012.  On a diluted common share basis, normalized FFO was $2.41 in 2013, compared to $2.02 in 2012, an increase of $0.39, or 19.3%.



See our discussion of FFO and normalized FFO (which are not financial measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP), in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and normalized FFO.



Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO)

In 2013, our AFFO increased by $188.9 million, or 68.9%, to $463.1 million versus $274.2 million in 2012. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was $2.41 in 2013, compared to $2.06 in 2012, an increase of $0.35, or 17.0%.



See our discussion of AFFO (which is not a financial measure under GAAP), in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO, normalized FFO and AFFO.

DIVIDEND POLICY



Distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock, 6.75% Monthly Income Class E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Class E preferred stock, and 6.625% Monthly Income Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or Class F preferred stock, if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.



Distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P. and Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders.



In order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2013, our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled $451.2 million, or approximately 161.4% of our estimated taxable income of $279.6 million. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance.  We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. Our 2013 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $409.2 million, representing 88.4% of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of $463.1 million.



The Class E preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.75% per annum on the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.6875 per annum per share). The Class F preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.625% per annum on the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.65625 per annum per share). Dividends on our Class E and Class F preferred stock are current.



Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, normalized FFO, AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our debt service requirements and any other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions paid by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.



Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year).



Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 38.7% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2013, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. We estimate that in 2014, between 15% and 30% of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY



Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. However, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.



Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Table of Obligations,” which is presented in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our $1.5 billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings.



Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2013, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes, term loan, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $4.18 billion, or approximately 33.2% of our total market capitalization of $12.59 billion.



We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2013 as the sum of:



·Shares of our common stock outstanding of 207,485,073, plus total common units of 851,568, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $37.33 per share on December 31, 2013, or $7.78 billion;

·Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25.00 per share) of the Class E preferred stock of $220.0 million;

·Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25.00 per share) of the Class F preferred stock of $408.8 million;

·Outstanding borrowings of $128.0 million on our credit facility;

·Outstanding mortgages payable of $783.4 million, which includes net mortgage premiums of $28.9 million;

·Outstanding borrowings of $70.0 million on our term loan; and

·Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of $3.2 billion, which excludes unamortized original issuance discounts of $14.5 million.



Investment Philosophy

We believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: 1) increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), 2) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or 3) fixed increases. We believe that a portfolio of properties owned under long-term net leases generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.



Investment Strategy

When identifying new properties for acquisition, we generally focus on providing capital to owners and operators of commercial tenants by acquiring the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business.



-9-








We primarily focus on acquiring properties with many of the following attributes:



·Tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow;

·Tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources;

·Tenants that are willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years);

·Tenants that are large owners and users of real estate;

·Real estate that is critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue (i.e. they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business);

·Real estate with property valuations at or below replacement cost;

·Properties with rental or lease payments that are at or below market rents; and

·Property transactions where we can achieve an attractive spread over our cost of capital.



From a retail perspective, our investment focus has primarily been on businesses that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31, 2013, approximately 59.1% of our retail rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business. We believe these service-oriented businesses would generally be difficult to duplicate over the Internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from Internet-based businesses.



Diversification is also a key objective of our investment strategy.  We believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant, industry, property type, and geographic location leads to more predictable investment results for our shareholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration.  Our investment efforts have led to a diversified property portfolio that, as of December 31, 2013, consisted of 3,896 properties located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, leased to 205 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industry segments. Each of the 47 industry segments, represented in our property portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 10.6% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2013.



Credit Strategy

We typically acquire and lease properties to tenants in transactions where we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return. Since 1970, our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96%.



We believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue, we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligations is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive; in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers.



In order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile.  We have established a four-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:



·Industry, company, market conditions and credit profile;

·Store profitability for retail locations, if profitability data is available;

·The importance of the real estate location to the operations of the company’s business; and

·Overall real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative rental rates.



Prior to entering into any transaction, our investment professionals, assisted by our research department, conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality.  The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization and other financial metrics.  We conduct additional due diligence, including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates.  We continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed, and providing summaries of these findings to management.

Acquisition Strategy

We seek to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national commercial tenants are capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale, strong consumer brands, advertising, and the selection of prime locations. Our acquisition strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national commercial tenants by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations. In addition, we frequently acquire large portfolios of properties net leased to multiple tenants in a variety of industries.  We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our proprietary relationships with various tenants, owners/developers, and advisors to uncover and secure transactions.  We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries, tenants and property locations for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value. In selecting potential investments, we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics:



·Properties that are freestanding, commercially-zoned with a single tenant;

·Properties that are important locations for regional and national commercial tenants;

·Properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants and/or can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business;

·Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas, relative to the business of our tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares; and

·Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term, net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for rent increases.



Portfolio Management Strategy

The active management of the property portfolio is also an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality.



We regularly review and analyze:



·The performance of the various industries of our tenants; and

·The operation, management, business planning, and financial condition of our tenants.



We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



·Generate higher returns;

·Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

·Extend our average remaining lease term; or

·Decrease tenant or industry concentration.



At December 31, 2013, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $12.0 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. In 2014, we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately $50 million in property sales for all of 2014.  We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.



Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.

Universal Shelf Registration

In February 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in February 2016. This replaces our prior shelf registration statement.  In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.



$1.5 Billion Acquisition Credit Facility

In October 2013, we increased our unsecured acquisition credit facility from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion.  The initial term of the credit facility expires in May 2016 and includes, at our election, a one-year extension option. Under this credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling. We also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility. Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.



At December 31, 2013, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.372 billion available on our credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $128.0 million.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, at December 31, 2013, was 1.2% per annum.  We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  At December 31, 2013, we remain in compliance with these covenants.



We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate.



We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.



Cash Reserves

We are organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  At December 31, 2013, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $10.3 million.



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.  We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.



Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. We are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook, Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 with a “stable” outlook, and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook.



-12-








Based on our current ratings, the credit facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% basis points over LIBOR.  The credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 1.85% if our credit facility is lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) LIBOR plus 1.00% if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.45% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3, and (ii) 0.15% for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.



We also issue senior debt securities and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.



The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.



Notes Outstanding

As of December 31, 2013, we had $3.2 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $14.5 million.  All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. Interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.



Mortgage Debt

As of December 31, 2013, we had $754.5 million of mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions.  Included in this amount is $514.4 million of mortgages payable assumed in connection with the ARCT acquisition.  Additionally, at December 31, 2013, we had net premiums totaling $28.9 million on these mortgages, of which $16.2 million is in connection with the ARCT acquisition.



Term Loan

In January 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in January 2018.  Borrowing under the term loan bears interest at LIBOR, plus 1.20%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 2.15%.



No Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts.



Corporate Responsibility

Realty Income is committed to providing an enjoyable, diverse and safe working atmosphere for our employees, to upholding our responsibilities as a public company operating for the benefit of our shareholders and to being mindful of the environment.  As The Monthly Dividend Company®, we believe our primary responsibility is to provide a dividend return to our shareholders. How we manage and use the physical, human and financial resources that enable us to acquire and own the real estate, which provides us with the lease revenue to pay monthly dividends, demonstrates our commitment to corporate responsibility.



Social Responsibility and Ethics.We are committed to being socially responsible and conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards. Our employees enjoy compensation that is in line with those of our peers and competitors, including generous healthcare benefits for employees and their families; participation in a 401K plan with a matching contribution by Realty Income; competitive vacation and time-off benefits; paid maternity leave and an infant-at-work program for new parents.  Our employees also have access to members of our Board of Directors to report anonymously, if desired, any suspicion of misconduct, by any member of our senior management or executive team.  We also have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity and adhere to all Equal Employer Opportunity Policy guidelines.



We apply the principles of full and fair disclosure in all of our business dealings, as outlined in our Corporate Code of Business Ethics. We are also committed to dealing fairly with all of our customers, suppliers and competitors.

Corporate Governance.We believe that nothing is more important than a company’s reputation for integrity and serving as a responsible fiduciary for its shareholders. We are committed to managing the company for the benefit of our shareholders and are focused on maintaining good corporate governance.  Practices that illustrate this commitment include:



·Our Board of Directors is comprised of eight directors, six of which are independent, non-employee directors

·Our Board of Directors is elected on an annual basis

·We employ a majority vote standard for elections

·Our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors works with independent consultants, in conducting annual compensation reviews for our key executives, and compensates each individual based on reaching certain performance metrics that determine the success of our company

·We adhere to all other corporate governance principles outlined in our “Corporate Governance Guidelines” document.



Environmental Practices.Our focus on energy related matters is demonstrated by how we manage our day-to-day activities in our corporate headquarters building.  In our headquarters building we promote energy conservation and encourage the following practices:



·Powering down office equipment at the end of the day

·Setting fax and copier machines to “energy saver mode”

·Encouraging employees to reduce paper usage whenever possible, by storing documents electronically and using “duplex” copy mode;

·Employing an automated “lights out” system that is activated 24/7; and

·Programming HVAC to only operate during normal business operating hours



In addition, our headquarters building was constructed according to the State of California energy standards and we have installed solar panels on our roof to fulfill our energy requirements. All of the windows on our building are dual-paned to increase energy efficiency and reduce our carbon footprint.



With respect to recycling and reuse practices, we encourage the use of recycled products and the recycling of materials during our operations.  Recycling bins are placed in all areas where materials are regularly disposed of and at the individual desks of our employees. Cell phones, wireless devices and office equipment is recycled or donated whenever possible.  We also continue to pursue a paperless environment since this reduces costs and saves trees.  As a result, we encourage file-sharing networks and environments to produce and edit documents in order to reduce the dissemination of hard copy documents, and have implemented an electronic invoice approval system.



With respect to the properties that we own, these properties are net-leased to our tenants who are responsible for maintaining the buildings and are in control of their energy usage and environmental sustainability practices.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION



At December 31, 2013, we owned a diversified portfolio:



·Of 3,896 properties;

·With an occupancy rate of 98.2%, or 3,826 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease;

·Leased to 205 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries;

·Located in 49 states and Puerto Rico;

·With over 62.6 million square feet of leasable space; and

·With an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,100 square feet, including approximately 10,600 square feet per retail property.



At December 31, 2013, of our 3,896 properties, 3,807 were leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.



As a result of our 2013 acquisitions, the following industry table has been modified from similar tables we have prepared in the past to reflect the changes below:



·Five new industries were added: (1) “government services,” (2) “health care,” (3) “jewelry,” (4) “other manufacturing,” and (5) “electrical utilities”; and

·Some properties previously included in the “other” industry were reclassified to both the “health care” and “government services” industries to better reflect the industry in which the tenant operates.
