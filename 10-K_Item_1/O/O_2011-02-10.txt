THE COMPANY



Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company®, is a Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO, per share.  Our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises. We have in-house acquisition, leasing, legal, credit research, real estate research, portfolio management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 42 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail and other commercial properties that ge
nerate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements (primarily 15 to 20 years).



In addition, we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties. Our portfolio management generally includes seeking:



●Contractual rent increases on existing leases;

●Rent increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions permit; and

●The active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant properties, and selectively selling properties, thereby mitigating our exposure to certain tenants and markets.



In acquiring additional properties, our strategy is primarily to acquire properties that are:



●Freestanding, single-tenant locations;

●Leased to regional and national commercial enterprises; and

●Leased under long-term, net-lease agreements.



At December 31, 2010, we owned a diversified portfolio:



●Of 2,496 properties;

●With an occupancy rate of 96.6%, or 2,412 properties occupied and only 84 properties available for lease;

●Leased to 122 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 32 separate industries;

●Located in 49 states;

●With over 21.2 million square feet of leasable space; and

●With an average leasable space per property of approximately 8,500 square feet.



Of the 2,496 properties in the portfolio, 2,485, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At December 31, 2010, of the 2,485 single-tenant properties, 2,402 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of approximately 11.4 years.



In addition, at December 31, 2010, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc., or Crest, had an inventory of three properties valued at $3.0 million, which are classified as held for investment. No Crest properties are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010. Crest was created to buy and sell properties, primarily to individual investors who are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In addition to the three properties, Crest also holds notes receivable of $22.1 million at December 31, 2010.



We typically acquire properties under long-term leases with regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises. Our acquisition and investment activities generally focus on businesses providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer and business needs.



-2-


Our net-lease agreements generally:



●Are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

●Require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses (taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

●Provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.



We commenced operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25 public and private real estate limited partnerships. Each of the partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and managing long-term, net-leased properties.



Our eight senior officers owned 1.1% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $44.5 million at February 1, 2011. Our directors and eight senior officers, as a group, owned 1.3% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $53.9 million at February 1, 2011.



Our common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol "O" with a cusip number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is 726728.



Our Class D cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprD" with a cusip number of 756109-609.



Our Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprE" with a cusip number of 756109-708.



In February 2011, we had 79 employees as compared to 72 employees in February 2010.



We maintain an Internet website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, Forms 3, 4, 5, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of this report.





RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Increases in Monthly Distributions to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 42-year policy of paying distributions monthly. Monthly distributions per share increased in April 2010 by $0.0003125 to $0.1433125, in July 2010 by $0.0003125 to $0.143625, in October 2010 by $0.0003125 to $0.1439375 and in January 2011 by $0.0003125 to $0.14425. The increase in January 2011 was our 53rdconsecutive quarterly increase and the 60thincrease in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994. In 2010, we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of $0.143, three in the amount of $0.1433125, three in the amount of $0.143625 and three in the amount of $0.1439375, totaling $1.721625. In December 2010, January 2
011 and February 2011, we declared distributions of $0.14425 per share, which were paid in January 2011 and will be paid in February 2011 and March 2011, respectively.



The current monthly distribution of $0.14425 per share represents an annualized distribution of $1.731 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 5.1% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $34.20 on December 31, 2010. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share, or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period.

-3-Table of contentsAcquisitions During 2010

During 2010, we invested $713.5 million in 186 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.9%. These 186 properties are located in 14 states, contain over 2.2 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 15.7 years. The 186 new properties we acquired are net-leased to commercial enterprises in the following 13 industries: apparel stores, automotive collision services, automotive service, crafts and novelties, consumer electronics, convenience store, drug stores, grocery stores, health and fitness, office supplies, restaurants, sporting goods and wine and spirits. There were no acquisitions by Crest in 2010.



The initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated total cost of the properties. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.



Included in the $713.5 million invested during 2010 are the following acquisitions:



●The acquisition and leaseback of approximately $304.1 million of winery and vineyard properties under 20-year, triple-net lease agreements with Diageo Chateau & Estates Wine Company, guaranteed by Diageo plc, or, together with its subsidiaries, Diageo.  The properties are primarily located in California’s Napa Valley and include two wineries that produce wines for Diageo’s Sterling Vineyards, or Sterling, and Beaulieu Vineyards, or BV, brands and 14 vineyards producing grapes for their Sterling, BV and other brands.  The properties include approximately 3,600 acres and 426,000 square feet of winery, production, storage, shipping and tourist buildings.  Diageo will continue to operate the wineries and vineyards.  As a result of this acquisition of properties, Diageo has become our largest tena
nt based on rental revenue.  Headquartered in London, Diageo is a global premium drinks company with a well-known portfolio of international brands of spirits, beer and wine.  Diageo ordinary shares trade on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol “DGE.L” and on the NYSE under the symbol “DEO.”

●The acquisition of 23 retail properties leased to 13 tenants in six states, for approximately $126.5 million, under long-term, net lease agreements.  The properties are in eight different industries, including apparel stores, consumer electronics, crafts and novelties, drug stores, grocery stores, health and fitness, office supplies, and sporting goods.  All of the properties acquired have in-place leases.

●The acquisition of 135 SuperAmerica convenience stores and one support facility, for approximately $247.6 million, under long-term, triple-net lease agreements. The stores are located in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and average approximately 3,500 leasable square feet on approximately 1.14 acres.

●The remaining 11 properties acquired totaled approximately $35.3 million.



Investments in Existing Properties

In 2010, we capitalized costs of $3.6 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.5 million for re-leasing costs and $2.1 million for building improvements.



$425 Million Acquisition Credit Facility

In December 2010, we entered into a new $425 million acquisition credit facility that replaced our previous $355 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2011.  The initial term of the new credit facility expires in March 2014 and includes two, one-year extension options.  Under the new credit facility, our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR. We also have other interest rate options available to us.  Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.  At December 31, 2010, there were no borrowings 
on our credit facility, but if there were, the effective borrowing rate would have been 2.1%.



Issuance of Common Stock

In December 2010, we issued 7,360,000 shares of common stock at a price of $33.70 per share.  The net proceeds of approximately $235.7 million were used to repay borrowings of $179.8 million under our acquisition credit facility and to fund property acquisitions during December 2010.  The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital.

-4-Table of contentsIn September 2010, we issued 6,198,500 shares of common stock at a price of $33.40 per share.  The net proceeds of approximately $196.9 million were used to repay borrowings of $49.7 million under our acquisition credit facility and to fund $126.5 million of property acquisitions during October 2010.  The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital.



Note Issuance

In June 2010, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due January 2021, or the 2021 Notes.  The price to the investor for the 2021 Notes was 99.404% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.826%.  The net proceeds of approximately $246.1 million from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, which were used to finance the acquisition of the Diageo properties.  Interest is paid semiannually on the 2021 Notes.



Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $106.5 million in 2010 versus $106.9 million in 2009, a decrease of $343,000. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.01 in 2010 as compared to $1.03 in 2009.



The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties. The amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.



The gain from the sale of properties during 2010 was $8.7 million, as compared to $8.1 million during 2009.



Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO)

In 2010, our FFO increased by $3.3 million, or 1.7%, to $193.7 million versus $190.4 million in 2009.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $1.83 in 2010 compared to $1.84 in 2009, a decrease of $0.01, or 0.5%.



See our discussion of FFO in the section entitled "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO.



Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO)

In 2010, our AFFO increased by $4.6 million, or 2.4%, to $197.3 million versus $192.7 million in 2009. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was $1.86 in 2010 and 2009.



See our discussion of AFFO in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO.





DISTRIBUTION POLICY



Distributions are paid monthly to our common, Class D preferred and Class E preferred stockholders if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.



In order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2010, our cash distributions totaled $206.8 million, or approximately 136.3% of our estimated REIT taxable income of $151.7 million. Our estimated REIT taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated REIT taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT distribution requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or performance.

-5-Table of contentsWe intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. Our 2010 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $182.5 million, representing 94.2% of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of $193.7 million.



The Class D preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7.375% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.84375 per annum per share). The Class E preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.75% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.6875 per annum per share). Dividends on our Class D and Class E preferred stock are current.



Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, our debt service requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.







BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY



Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. However, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.



Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2010, our total outstanding borrowings were $1.6 billion of senior unsecured notes, or approximately 26.7% of our total market capitalization of $5.99 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility at December 31, 2010.

-6-Table of contentsWe define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2010 as the sum of:



●Shares of our common stock outstanding of 118,058,988 multiplied by the last reported NYSE sales price of $34.20 per share on December 31, 2010, or $4.04 billion;

●Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

●Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class E preferred stock of $220 million; and

●Outstanding notes of $1.6 billion.



Investment Philosophy

We believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant's responsibility for property expenses, generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer
 the potential for growth in rental income.



Investment Strategy

When identifying new properties for acquisition, our focus is generally on providing capital to owners and operators of retail and other commercial enterprises by acquiring, then leasing back, the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business. We categorize tenants as: 1) venture market, 2) middle market, and 3) upper market. Venture companies typically offer a newer concept, generally in one geographic region of the country and operate between five and 50 locations. Middle market companies typically have 50 to 500 locations, operations in more than one geographic region, have been successful through one or more economic cycles, and have a proven, replicable concept. The upper market tenants typically consist of companies with 500 or more locations, operating a proven, mature concept. U
pper market tenants generally have strong operating histories and access to several sources of capital.



We primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail and other commercial enterprises that we believe are attractive for investment because:



●They generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles that can adversely affect new venture companies;

●They typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited financing options than upper market tenants;

●They generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve as their businesses have grown;

●Their relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a greater number of locations; and

●Middle market tenants typically have the critical mass to survive during economic or market dislocations.



Historically, our investment focus has primarily been on retail and other commercial enterprises that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31, 2010, approximately 78% of our rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business. We believe these service-oriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the Internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from Internet-based businesses.



Credit Strategy

We primarily provide sale-leaseback financing to less than investment grade tenants. We typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national commercial enterprises and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return. Since 1970, our overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 98.2%, and our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96%.



-7-


We believe the principal financial obligations of most commercial enterprises typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business, we believe the risk of default on a tenants’ lease obligations is less than the tenants' unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant dur
ing reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants' individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers.



In order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile.  We have established a three-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:



●Industry, company, market conditions and credit profile;

●Store profitability, if profitability data is available, and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the company’s business; and

●Overall real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative rental rates.



The typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more locations. Generally the properties:



●Are located in highly visible areas;

●Have easy access to major thoroughfares; and

●Have attractive demographics.



Acquisition Strategy

We seek to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises are capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale, strong consumer brands, advertising, and the selection of prime locations. We execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national commercial enterprises by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations. We undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries, tenants and property locations for investment. Our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value. In selecting real estate for potential investment, we generally seek to acquire properties that
 have the following characteristics:



●Freestanding, commercially-zoned property with a single tenant;

●Properties that are important locations for regional and national commercial enterprises;

●Properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants and/or can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business;

●Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares; and

●Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for rent increases.



Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which sometimes impact our access to and cost of capital. We continue to monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. See Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in this annual report.

-8-Table of contentsPortfolio Management Strategy

The active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality.



Our executives regularly review and analyze:



●The performance of the various industries of our tenants; and

●The operation, management, business planning, and financial condition of our tenants.



We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



●Generate higher returns;

●Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

●Extend our average remaining lease term; or

●Decrease tenant or industry concentration.



At December 31, 2010, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $3.6 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. Additionally, we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified, from which we anticipate receiving between $10 million and $35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties.



Universal Shelf Registration

In March 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which expires in March 2012. In accordance with the SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.



$425 Million Acquisition Credit Facility

In December 2010, we entered into a new $425 million revolving, unsecured credit facility that replaced our previous $355 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2011. The initial term of the new credit facility expires in March 2014 and includes two, one-year extension options. Under the new credit facility, our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at LIBOR, plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR. We also have other interest rate options available to us.  Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation. At December 31, 2010, we had a borrowing capacity of $425 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding bal
ance.  If there were outstanding borrowings, the effective borrowing rate would have been 2.1%.



We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility, up to $200 million, to a total borrowing capacity of $625 million.  Any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the banks participating in our credit facility.



-9-


We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.



Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings.  We are currently assigned the following investment grade credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes: Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes. All of these ratings have "stable" outlooks.



Based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR.  The credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 300 basis points if our credit facility is lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) LIBOR plus 175 basis points if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 50 basis points for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3, and (ii) 30 basis points for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.



We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.



The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.



Mortgage Debt

We have no mortgage debt on any of our properties.



No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in "variable interest entities" or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments. Additionally, we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. As such, our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of off-balance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.



Competitive Strategy

We believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages:



●Size and Type of Investment Properties:We believe smaller ($500,000 to $10,000,000) net-leased properties, whether purchased individually or as part of larger portfolio purchases, represent an attractive investment opportunity in today's real estate environment. Due to the complexities of acquiring and managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets, we believe these types of properties have not experienced significant institutional ownership interest or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by larger income-producing properties. We believe the less intensive day-to-day property management required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller properties, is an effective investment strategy. The tenants of our freestanding properti
es generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they generally need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these tenants, our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease arrangement, allows the commercial enterprise to free up capital.

-10-


●Investment in New Industries:We will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive. When analyzing new industries, we seek to acquire properties which are critical to the success of a commercial enterprise, through its distribution of the product or service. Other characteristics may include, but are not limited to, industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national store operators and other commercial enterprises can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base.



●Diversification:Diversification of the portfolio by industry type, tenant, and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders, therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December 31, 2010, we owned a diversified property portfolio that consisted of 2,496 properties located in 49 states, leased to 122 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 32 industry segments. Each of the 32 industry segments, represented in our property portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 19.1% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2010.



●Management Specialization:We believe that our management's specialization in acquiring and managing single-tenant properties, operated under net-lease agreements, purchased individually or as part of a larger portfolio, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.



●Technology:We intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to carry out our operations efficiently and economically. We maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio's performance and actively manage our investments. We believe that technology and information-based systems play an important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION



At December 31, 2010, we owned a diversified portfolio:



●Of 2,496 properties;

●With an occupancy rate of 96.6%, or 2,412 properties occupied and only 84 properties available for lease;

●Leased to 122 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 32 separate industries;

●Located in 49 states;

●With over 21.2 million square feet of leasable space; and

●With an average leasable space per property of approximately 8,500 square feet.



In addition to our real estate portfolio, our subsidiary, Crest, had an inventory of three properties located in three states at December 31, 2010. These properties are valued at $3.0 million and are classified as held for investment. No Crest properties are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010.



At December 31, 2010, of our 2,496 properties, 2,402 were leased under net-lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.



Our net-lease agreements generally:



●Are for initial terms of 15 to 20 years;

●Require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses (taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

●Provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases. Where leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index, generally these increases become part of the new permanent base rent. Where leases provide for percentage rent, this additional rent is typically payable only if the tenants' gross sales, for a given period (usually one year), exceed a specified level and is then typically calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross sales in excess of that level.

-17-Table of contentsItem 1A:Risk Factors



This "Risk Factors" section contains references to our "capital stock" and to our "stockholders."  Unless expressly stated otherwise, the references to our "capital stock" represent our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock, while the references to our "stockholders" represent holders of our common stock and any class or series of our preferred stock.



In order to grow we need to continue to acquire investment properties.  The acquisition of investment properties may be subject to competitive pressures.

We face competition in the acquisition, operation and sale of property. We expect competition from:



●Businesses;

●Individuals;

●Fiduciary accounts and plans; and

●Other entities engaged in real estate investment and financing.



Some of these competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties we wish to purchase.



Negative market conditions or adverse events affecting our existing or potential tenants, or the industries in which they operate, could have an adverse impact on our ability to attract new tenants, re-lease space, collect rent or renew leases, which could adversely affect our cash flow from operations and inhibit growth.

Cash flow from operations depends in part on the ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. We could be adversely affected by various facts and events over which we have limited or no control, such as:



●Lack of demand in areas where our properties are located;

●Inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;

●Oversupply of space and changes in market rental rates;

●Declines in our tenants' creditworthiness and ability to pay rent, which may be affected by their operations, the current economic situation and competition within their industries from other operators;

●Defaults by and bankruptcies of tenants, failure of tenants to pay rent on a timely basis, or failure of tenants to comply with their contractual obligations; and

●Economic or physical decline of the areas where the properties are located.



At any time, any tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its operating results or overall financial condition. As a result, a tenant may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, decline to extend a lease upon its expiration, become insolvent or declare bankruptcy. Any tenant bankruptcy or insolvency, leasing delay or failure to make rental payments when due could result in the termination of the tenant's lease and material losses to us.



If tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, we may not be able to rent or sell the properties.  Furthermore, leases that are renewed, and some new leases for properties that are re-leased, may have terms that are less economically favorable than expiring lease terms, or may require us to incur significant costs, such as renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs. Negative market conditions may cause us to sell vacant properties for less than their carrying value, which could result in impairments. Any of these events could adversely affect cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to shareholders and service indebtedness. A significant portion of the costs of owning property, such as real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance, are not necessarily reduced when circumstances caus
e a decrease in rental revenue from the properties. In a weakened financial condition, tenants may not be able to pay these costs of ownership and we may be unable to recover these operating expenses from them.

-18-Table of contentsFurther, the occurrence of a tenant bankruptcy or insolvency could diminish the income we receive from the tenant's lease or leases. In addition, a bankruptcy court might authorize the tenant to terminate its leases with us. If that happens, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid future rent would be subject to statutory limitations that most likely would be substantially less than the remaining rent we are owed under the leases. In addition, any claim we have for unpaid past rent, if any, may not be paid in full. As a result, tenant bankruptcies may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Any of these events could adversely affect cash from operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders and service indebtedness.



Eighty-four of our properties were available for lease or sale at December 31, 2010, of which all but one were single-tenant properties. At December 31, 2010, 32 of our properties under lease were unoccupied and available for sublease by the tenants, all of which were current with their rent and other obligations. During 2010, each of our tenants accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue.



For the fourth quarter of 2010, our tenants in the restaurant and convenience store industries accounted for approximately 19.1% and 17.4%, respectively, of our rental revenue. A downturn in either of these industries, whether nationwide or limited to specific sectors of the United States could adversely affect tenants in these industries, which in turn could have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock. Individually, each of the other industries in our property portfolio accounted for less than 10% of our rental revenue for the fourth quarter of 2010. Nevertheless, downturns in these other industries could also adversely affect our tenants
, which in turn could also have a material adverse affect on our financial position, results of operations and our ability to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions on our common and preferred stock.  In addition, we may in the future make additional investments in the restaurant industry and convenience store industry, which would increase these industries’ percentages of our rental revenues, thereby increasing the effect that such a downturn in these industries would have on us.



In addition, a substantial number of our properties are leased to middle-market retail and other commercial enterprises that generally have more limited financial and other resources than certain upper-market retail and other commercial enterprises, and therefore, they are more likely to be adversely affected by a downturn in their respective businesses or in the regional or national economy.



Furthermore, we may make selected acquisitions of properties that fall outside our historical focus on freestanding, single-tenant, net-lease retail locations in the United States. We may be exposed to a variety of new risks by expanding into new property types and/or new jurisdictions outside the United States. These risks may include a limited knowledge and understanding of the industry in which the tenant operates, new types of real estate locations and lease structures, and new laws and culture of any non-U.S. jurisdiction.



As a property owner, we may be subject to unknown environmental liabilities.

Investments in real property can create a potential for environmental liability. An owner of property can face liability for environmental contamination created by the presence or discharge of hazardous substances on the property. We can face such liability regardless of:



●Our knowledge of the contamination;

●The timing of the contamination;

●The cause of the contamination; or

●The party responsible for the contamination of the property.



There may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware. In that regard, a number of our properties are leased to operators of convenience stores that sell petroleum-based fuels, as well as to operators of oil change and tune-up facilities and operators that use chemicals and other waste products. These facilities, and some other of our properties, use, or may have used in the past, underground lifts or underground tanks for the storage of petroleum-based or waste products, which could create a potential for the release of hazardous substances.



-19-


The presence of hazardous substances on a property may adversely affect our ability to lease or sell that property and we may incur substantial remediation costs. Although our leases generally require our tenants to operate in compliance with all applicable federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, and to indemnify us against any environmental liabilities arising from the tenants’ activities on the property, we could nevertheless be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest. There also can be no assurance that our tenants could or would satisfy their indemnification obligations under their leases. The discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, our financial condition or our ability to make distribu
tions to stockholders and to pay the principal of and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness.



In addition, several of our properties were built during the period when asbestos was commonly used in building construction and other buildings with asbestos may be acquired by us in the future. Environmental laws govern the presence, maintenance and removal of asbestos-containing materials, or ACMs, and require that owners or operators of buildings containing asbestos properly manage and maintain the asbestos, that they adequately inform or train those who may come into contact with asbestos and that they undertake special precautions, including removal or other abatement in the event that asbestos is disturbed during renovation or demolition of a building. These laws may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or 
operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos fibers.



It is also possible that some of our properties may contain or develop harmful mold, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation of the problem. When excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing, as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms,including allergic or other reactions. As a result, should our tenants or their employees or customers be exposed to mold at any of our properties we could be required to undertake a costly remediation programto contain or remove the mold from the affected property, which would reduce ourcash available for distribution. In addition, exposure to mold by our tenants or others could expose us to liability if property damage or health concerns arise.



Compliance.We have not been notified by any governmental authority, and are not otherwise aware, of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous substances, toxic substances, or petroleum products in connection with any of our present properties. In addition, we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all present federal, state and local laws relating to ACMs. Nevertheless, if environmental contamination should exist, we could be subject to strict liability by virtue of our ownership interest.



Insurance and Indemnity.In June 2005, we entered into a seven-year environmental insurance policy, or the June 2005 policy, which expires on June 1, 2012 on our property portfolio which replaced the previous five-year environmental insurance policy. The limits on our current policy are $10 million per occurrence, and $50 million in the aggregate, subject to a $40,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for properties with underground storage tanks and a $100,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for all other properties.



Additionally, in December 2009, we entered into a ten-year environmental insurance policy that expires in December 2019 that will initially act in an excess capacity to our June 2005 policy.  On June 1, 2012, this policy will become our primary environmental policy with the same limits as the June 2005 policy, except that once we pay a total of $1 million for self insurance retention, there will be a $50,000 per loss maintenance fee, rather than the $100,000 self insurance retention, per occurrence, for general environmental claims.



It is possible that our insurance could be insufficient to address any particular environmental situation and that, in the future, we could be unable to obtain insurance for environmental matters at a reasonable cost, or at all. Our tenants are generally responsible for, and indemnify us against, liabilities for environmental matters that occur on our properties.  For properties that have underground storage tanks, in addition to providing an indemnity in our favor, the tenants generally obtain environmental insurance or rely upon the state funds in the states where these properties are located to reimburse tenants for environmental remediation.

If we fail to qualify as a real estate investment trust, the amount of dividends we are able to pay would decrease, which could adversely affect the market price of our capital stock and could adversely affect the value of our debt securities.

Commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 1994, we believe that we have been organized and have operated, and we intend to continue to operate, so as to qualify as a "REIT" under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code. However, we cannot assure you that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that has satisfied the requirements for qualification as a REIT, or that we will continue to be organized or operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT.



Qualification as a REIT involves the satisfaction of numerous requirements under highly technical and complex Code provisions, for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations, as well as the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.



For example, in order to qualify as a REIT, at least 95% of our gross income in each year must be derived from qualifying sources, and we must pay distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (as defined in the Code and determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains).



In the future, it is possible that legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT, or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.



If we fail to satisfy all of the requirements for qualification as a REIT, we may be subject to certain penalty taxes or, in some circumstances, we may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:



●We would be required to pay federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates;

●We would not be allowed a deduction in computing our taxable income for amounts distributed to our stockholders;

●We could be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost;

●We would no longer be required to make distributions to stockholders; and

●This treatment would substantially reduce amounts available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability for the years involved, which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities.



Even if we qualify for and maintain our REIT status, we may be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property. For example, if we have net income from a prohibited transaction, that income will be subject to a 100% tax. Our subsidiary, Crest, is subject to federal and state taxes at the applicable tax rates on its income and property.



Distributions requirements imposed by law limit our flexibility.

To maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains each year. We also are subject to tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income (including net capital gains) each year.



In addition, we are subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax to the extent that we fail to distribute during any calendar year at least the sum of 85% of our ordinary income for that calendar year, 95% of our capital gain net income for the calendar year, and any amount of that income that was not distributed in prior years.

-21-Table of contentsWe intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the distribution requirements of the Code as well as to reduce our exposure to federal income taxes and the nondeductible excise tax. Differences in timing between the receipt of income and the payment of expenses to arrive at taxable income, along with the effect of required debt amortization payments, could require us to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet the distribution requirements that are necessary to achieve the tax benefits associated with qualifying as a REIT.



Future issuances of equity securities could dilute the interest of holders of our common stock.

Our future growth will depend, in large part, upon our ability to raise additional capital. If we were to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity securities, we could dilute the interests of holders of our common stock. The interests of our common stockholders could also be diluted by the issuance of shares of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding options or pursuant to stock incentive plans. Likewise, our Board of Directors is authorized to cause us to issue preferred stock of any class or series (with dividend, voting and other rights as determined by the Board of Directors). Accordingly, the Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock with voting, dividend and other similar rights that could dilute, or otherwise adversely affect, the interest of holders of our common stock.



We are subject to risks associated with debt and capital stock financing.

We intend to incur additional indebtedness in the future, including borrowings under our $425 million acquisition credit facility. At December 31, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $425 million acquisition credit facility and we had a total of $1.6 billion of outstanding unsecured senior debt securities. To the extent that new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase. As a result, we are and will be subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. We also face variable interest rate risk as the interest rate on our $425 million credit facility is variable and could therefore increase over time.  We also face the risk that we may be unable to refinance or re
pay our debt as it comes due. Given the recent disruptions in the financial markets and the ongoing financial crisis in Europe (which relates primarily to concerns that certain European countries may be unable to repay their national debt), we also face the risk that one or more of the participants in our credit facility may not be able to lend us money.



In addition, our $425 million credit facility contains provisions that could limit or, in certain cases, prohibit the payment of distributions on our common stock and preferred stock.  In particular, our $425 million acquisition credit facility provides that, if an event of default (as defined in the credit facility) exists, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries may make any distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock, during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters in an aggregate amount in excess of the greater of:



●The sum of (a) 95% of our adjusted funds from operations (as defined in the credit facility) for that period plus (b) the aggregate amount of cash distributions on our preferred stock for that period, and

●The minimum amount of cash distributions required to be made to our shareholders in order to maintain our status as a REIT, for federal income tax purposes,



except that we may repurchase or redeem preferred stock with the net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock or preferred stock. The $425 million credit facility further provides that, in the event of a failure to pay principal, interest or any other amount payable thereunder when due or upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization with respect to us or with respect to any of our subsidiaries that has guaranteed amounts payable under the credit facility or that meets a significance test set forth in the credit facility, we and our subsidiaries may not pay any distributions on (except distributions payable in shares of a given class of our stock to the shareholders of that class), or repurchase or redeem, among other things, any shares of our common stock or preferred stock.  If any s
uch event of default were to occur, it would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of our outstanding common and preferred stock and on the market value of our debt securities, and may adversely affect our ability to qualify, or prevent us from qualifying, as a REIT.

-22-Table of contentsOur indebtedness could also have other important consequences to holders of our common and preferred stock, including:



●Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;

●Limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements;

●Requiring the use of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations for the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate requirements;

●Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and

●Putting us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors with less indebtedness.



Our business operations may not generate the cash needed to make distributions on our capital stock or to service our indebtedness.

Our ability to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock and payments on our indebtedness, and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to make distributions on our common stock and preferred stock, to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs.



The market value of our capital stock and debt securities could be substantially affected by various factors.

The market value of our capital stock and debt securities will depend on many factors, which may change from time to time, including:



●Prevailing interest rates, increases in which may have an adverse effect on the market value of our capital stock and debt securities;

●The market for similar securities issued by other REITs;

●General economic and financial market conditions;

●The financial condition, performance and prospects of us, our tenants and our competitors;

●Changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts with respect to us, our competitors or our industry;

●Changes in our credit ratings; and

●Actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results.



In addition, over the last three years, prices of common stock in the U.S. trading markets have been experiencing extreme price fluctuations, and the market price of our common stock has also fluctuated significantly during this period. As a result of these and other factors, investors who purchase our capital stock and debt securities may experience a decrease, which could be substantial and rapid, in the market value of our capital stock and debt securities, including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects.



Real estate ownership is subject to particular economic conditions that may have a negative impact on our revenue.

We are subject to all of the inherent risks associated with the ownership of real estate.  In particular, we face the risk that rental revenue from our properties may be insufficient to cover all corporate operating expenses, debt service payments on indebtedness we incur and distributions on our capital stock. Additional real estate ownership risks include:



●Adverse changes in general or local economic conditions;

●Changes in supply of, or demand for, similar or competing properties;

●Changes in interest rates and operating expenses;

●Competition for tenants;

●Changes in market rental rates;

●Inability to lease properties upon termination of existing leases;

●Renewal of leases at lower rental rates;

●Inability to collect rents from tenants due to financial hardship, including bankruptcy;





















-23-


●Changes in tax, real estate, zoning and environmental laws that may have an adverse impact upon the value of real estate;●Uninsured property liability;●Property damage or casualty losses;●Unexpected expenditures for capital improvements or to bring properties into compliance with applicable federal, state and local laws;●The need to periodically renovate and repair our properties;●Physical or weather-related damage to properties;●The potential risk of functional obsolescence of properties over time;●Acts of terrorism and war; and●Acts of God and other factors beyond the control of our management.



An uninsured loss or a loss that exceeds the policy limits on our properties could subject us to lost capital or revenue on those properties.

Under the terms and conditions of the leases currently in force on our properties, tenants generally are required to indemnify and hold us harmless from liabilities resulting from injury to persons, air, water, land or property, due to activities conducted on the properties, except for claims arising from the negligence or intentional misconduct of us or our agents. Additionally, tenants are generally required, at the tenant's expense, to obtain and keep in full force during the term of the lease, liability and property damage insurance policies. The insurance policies our tenants are required to maintain for property damage are generally in amounts not less than the full replacement cost of the improvements less slab, foundations, supports and other customarily excluded improvements. Our tenants are generally required to maintain gener
al liability coverage varying between $1,000,000 and $10,000,000 depending on the tenant and the industry in which the tenant operates.



-24-Table of contentsCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and fire, safety, and other regulations may require us to make unintended expenditures that could adversely impact our results of operations.



Property taxes may increase without notice.

The real property taxes on our properties and any other properties that we develop or acquire in the future may increase as property tax rates change and as those properties are assessed or reassessed by tax authorities.



We depend on key personnel.

We depend on the efforts of our executive officers and key employees. The loss of the services of our executive officers and key employees could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition and on our ability to pay the principal and interest on our debt securities and other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders. It is possible that we will not be able to recruit additional personnel with equivalent experience in the net-lease industry.



Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may affect the value of our debt and equity securities, the markets in which we operate and our results of operations.

Terrorist attacks may negatively affect our operations, the market price of our capital stock and the value of our debt securities. There can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks against the United States or U.S. businesses. These attacks, or armed conflicts, may directly impact our physical facilities or the businesses of our tenants.



If events like these were to occur, they could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the U.S. and worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in or prolong an economic recession in the U.S. or abroad. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and revenues and on the market price of our capital stock and on the value of our debt securities. It could also have an adverse effect on our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt securities or other indebtedness and to make distributions to our stockholders.

-25-Table of contentsDisruptions in the financial markets could affect our ability to obtain financing on reasonable terms and have other adverse effects on us and the market price of our common stock.



Inflation may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Although inflation has not materially impacted our results of operations in the recent past, increased inflation could have a more pronounced negative impact on any variable rate debt we incur in the future and on our results of operations. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in our leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation. Likewise, even though net leases reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation, substantial inflationary pressures and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue, which may adversely affect the tenants' ability to pay rent.



Current volatility in market and economic conditions may impact the accuracy of the various estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and footnotes to the financial statements.

Various estimates are used in the preparation of our financial statements, including estimates related to asset and liability valuations (or potential impairments), and various receivables. Often these estimates require the use of market data values which are currently difficult to assess, as well as estimates of future performance or receivables collectability which can also be difficult to accurately predict. Although management believes it has been prudent and used reasonable judgment in making these estimates, it is possible that actual results may differ from these estimates.



Changes in accounting standards may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.The SEC is currently considering whether issuers in the U.S. should be required to prepare financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, instead of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP.  IFRS is a comprehensive set of accounting standards promulgated by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IASB, which are rapidly gaining worldwide acceptance.  The SEC has indicated that it will decide in 2011 whether IFRS will be required for U.S. issuers. If the SEC decides to require IFRS, it expects that U.S. issuers would first report under the new standards beginning in approximately 2015 or 2016, although the timeframe has not been finalized.  Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, is considering various changes to GAAP, some of w
hich may be significant, as part of a joint effort with the IASB to converge accounting standards.  Although the FASB and IASB currently have a project on their agenda to examine the accounting for leases, the project may not result in the issuance of a final standard or a standard that would be comparable to current GAAP.  If IFRS is adopted, the potential issues associated with lease accounting, along with other potential changes associated with the adoption or convergence with IFRS, may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.

Item 7:Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations



GENERAL



Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company®, is a Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO, per share.  Our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises. We have in-house acquisition, leasing, legal, credit research, real estate research, portfolio management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 42 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail and other commercial properties that ge
nerate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements (primarily 15 to 20 years).



In addition, we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties.



At December 31, 2010, we owned a diversified portfolio:



●Of 2,496 properties;

●With an occupancy rate of 96.6%, or 2,412 properties occupied and only 84 properties available for lease;

●Leased to 122 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 32 separate industries;

●Located in 49 states;

●With over 21.2 million square feet of leasable space; and

●With an average leasable space per property of approximately 8,500 square feet.



Of the 2,496 properties in the portfolio, 2,485, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At December 31, 2010, of the 2,485 single-tenant properties, 2,402 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension options) of approximately 11.4 years.



In addition, at December 31, 2010, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc. ("Crest"), had an inventory of three properties valued at $3.0 million, which are classified as held for investment. No Crest properties are classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010. Crest was created to buy and sell properties, primarily to individual investors who are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). In addition to the three properties, Crest also holds notes receivable of $22.1 million at December 31, 2010. Crest did not acquire any properties in 2010.



LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES



Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. However, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be invested on an accretive basis into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.

-29-Table of contentsConservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2010, our total outstanding borrowings were $1.6 billion of senior unsecured notes, or approximately 26.7% of our total market capitalization of $5.99 billion. There were no outstanding borrowings on our credit facility at December 31, 2010.



We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2010 as the sum of:



●Shares of our common stock outstanding of 118,058,988 multiplied by the last reported NYSE sales price of $34.20 per share on December 31, 2010, or $4.04 billion;

●Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

●Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class E preferred stock of $220 million; and

●Outstanding notes of $1.6 billion.



Mortgage Debt

We have no mortgage debt on any of our properties.



$425 Million Acquisition Credit Facility

In December 2010, we entered into a new $425 million acquisition credit facility that replaced our previous $355 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2011. The initial term of the new credit facility expires in March 2014 and includes two, one-year extension options. Under the new credit facility, our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is not subject to a LIBOR floor.  We also have other interest rate options available to us. At December 31, 2010, we had a borrowing capacity of $425 million available on our credit facility and no outstanding balance.
  If there were outstanding borrowings, the effective borrowing rate would have been 2.1%.



We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility, up to $200 million, to a total borrowing capacity of $625 million.  Any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility.



Cash Reserves

We are organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties. We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital. At December 31, 2010, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $17.6 million.



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future. We intend, however, to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.



Acquisitions During 2010

During 2010, we invested $713.5 million in 186 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.9%. These 186 properties are located in 14 states, contain over 2.2 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 15.7 years. The 186 new properties we acquired are net-leased to commercial enterprises in the following 13 industries: apparel stores, automotive collision services, automotive service, crafts and novelties, consumer electronics, convenience stores, drug stores, grocery stores, health and fitness, office supplies, restaurants, sporting goods and wine and spirits. There were no acquisitions by Crest in 2010.

-30-Table of contentsThe initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated total cost of the properties. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.



Included in the $713.5 million invested during 2010 are the following acquisitions:



●The acquisition and leaseback of approximately $304.1 million of winery and vineyard properties under 20-year, triple-net lease agreements with Diageo Chateau & Estates Wine Company, guaranteed by Diageo plc, or, together with its subsidiaries, Diageo.  The properties are primarily located in California’s Napa Valley and include two wineries that produce wines for Diageo’s Sterling Vineyards, or Sterling, and Beaulieu Vineyards, or BV, brands and 14 vineyards producing grapes for their Sterling, BV and other brands.  The properties include approximately 3,600 acres and 426,000 square feet of winery, production, storage, shipping and tourist buildings.  Diageo will continue to operate the wineries and vineyards.  As a result of this acquisition of properties, Diageo has become our largest tena
nt based on rental revenue.  Headquartered in London, Diageo is a global premium drinks company with a well-known portfolio of international brands of spirits, beer and wine.  Diageo ordinary shares trade on the London Stock Exchange under the symbol “DGE.L” and on the NYSE under the symbol “DEO.”

●The acquisition of 23 retail properties leased to 13 tenants in six states, for approximately $126.5 million, under long-term, net lease agreements.  The properties are in eight different industries, including apparel stores, consumer electronics, crafts and novelties, drug stores, grocery stores, health and fitness, office supplies, and sporting goods.  All of the properties acquired have in-place leases.

●The acquisition of 135 SuperAmerica convenience stores and one support facility, for approximately $247.6 million, under long-term, triple-net lease agreements. The stores are located in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and average approximately 3,500 leasable square feet on approximately 1.14 acres.

●The remaining 11 properties acquired totaled approximately $35.3 million.



Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which sometimes impact our access to and cost of capital. We continue to monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. See our discussion of "Risk Factors" in this annual report.



Increases in Monthly Distributions to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 42-year policy of paying distributions monthly. Monthly distributions per share increased in April 2010 by $0.0003125 to $0.1433125, in July 2010 by $0.0003125 to $0.143625, in October 2010 by $0.0003125 to $0.1439375 and in January 2011 by $0.0003125 to $0.14425. The increase in January 2011 was our 53rdconsecutive quarterly increase and the 60thincrease in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, in 1994. In 2010, we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of $0.143, three in the amount of $0.1433125, three in the amount of $0.143625 and three in the amount of $0.1439375, totaling $1.721625
. In December 2010, January 2011 and February 2011, we declared distributions of $0.14425 per share, which were paid in January 2011 and will be paid in February 2011 and March 2011, respectively.



The monthly distribution of $0.14425 per share represents an annualized distribution of $1.731 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 5.1% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $34.20 on December 31, 2010. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share, or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period.

-31-Table of contentsIssuance of Common Stock

In December 2010, we issued 7,360,000 shares of common stock at a price of $33.70 per share.  The net proceeds of approximately $235.7 million were used to repay borrowings of $179.8 million under our acquisition credit facility and to fund property acquisitions during December 2010.  The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital.



In September 2010, we issued 6,198,500 shares of common stock at a price of $33.40 per share.  The net proceeds of approximately $196.9 million were used to repay borrowings of $49.7 million under our acquisition credit facility and to fund $126.5 million of property acquisitions during October 2010.  The remaining net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes and working capital.



Note Issuance

In June 2010, we issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior unsecured notes due January 2021 (the “2021 Notes”).  The price to the investor for the 2021 Notes was 99.404% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 5.826%.  The net proceeds of approximately $246.1 million from this offering were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, which were used to finance the acquisition of the Diageo properties.  Interest is paid semiannually on the 2021 Notes.



Universal Shelf Registration

In March 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which expires in March 2012. In accordance with the SEC rules, the amount of the securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or any combination of such securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.



Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings.  We are currently assigned the following investment grade credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes: Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes. All of these ratings have "stable" outlooks.



Based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR.  The credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 300 basis points if our credit facility is lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) LIBOR plus 175 basis points if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 50 basis points for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3, and (ii) 30 basis points for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.



We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.



The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.

-32-Table of contentsNotes Outstanding

Our senior unsecured note obligations consist of the following as of December 31, 2010, sorted by maturity date (dollars in millions):

5.375% notes, issued in March 2003 and due in March 2013$1005.5% notes, issued in November 2003 and due in November 20151505.95% notes, issued in September 2006 and due in September 20162755.375% notes, issued in September 2005 and due in September 20171756.75% notes, issued in September 2007 and due in August 20195505.75% notes, issued in June 2010 and due in January 20212505.875% bonds, issued in March 2005 and due in March 2035100$1,600



All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. Interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually. All of these notes and bonds contain various covenants, including: (i) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 60%; (ii) a limitation on incurrence of any secured debt which would cause our secured debt to total adjusted assets ratio to exceed 40%; (iii) a limitation on incurrence of any debt which would cause our debt service coverage ratio to be less than 1.5 times; and (iv) the maintenance at all times of total unencumbered assets not less than 150% of our outstanding unsecured debt. We have been in compliance with these covenants since each of the notes and bonds was issued.



The following is a summary of the key financial covenants for our senior unsecured notes, as defined and calculated per the terms of our notes. These calculations, which are not based on GAAP measurements, are presented to investors to show our ability to incur additional debt under the terms of our notes only and are not measures of our liquidity or performance.

Preferred Stock Outstanding

In 2004, we issued 5.1 million shares of 7.375% Class D cumulative redeemable preferred stock. In May 2009, shares of Class D preferred stock became redeemable at our option for $25 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends on shares of Class D preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears.



In 2006, we issued 8.8 million shares of 6.75% Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock. Beginning December 7, 2011, shares of Class E preferred stock become redeemable at our option for $25 per share, plus any accrued and unpaid dividends. Dividends on shares of Class E preferred stock are paid monthly in arrears.



We are current in our obligations to pay dividends on our Class D and Class E preferred stock.



No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in "variable interest entities" or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments. Additionally, we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. As such, our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of off-balance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Critical Accounting Policies

Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our consolidated financial statements are the basis for our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Preparing our consolidated financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. We believe that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. This summary sh
ould be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.



In order to prepare our consolidated financial statements according to the rules and guidelines set forth by GAAP, many subjective judgments must be made with regard to critical accounting policies. One of these judgments is our estimate for useful lives in determining depreciation expense for our properties. Depreciation on a majority of our buildings and improvements is computed using the straight–line method over an estimated useful life of 25 years. If we use a shorter or longer estimated useful life, it could have a material impact on our results of operations. We believe that 25 years is an appropriate estimate of useful life.



When acquiring a property for investment purposes, we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to: 1) land and 2) building and improvements, based in each case on their estimated fair values.



For properties acquired with in-place operating leases, the fair value of real estate is allocated to: (1) land, (2) building and improvements, and (3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their estimated fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market and below-market leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships.



Another significant judgment must be made as to if, and when, impairment losses should be taken on our properties when events or a change in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. A provision is made for impairment if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property. Key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, capital expenditures, and property sales capitalization rates. If a property is held for sale, it is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell. The carrying value of our real estate is the largest component of our consolidated balance sheet. If events should occur that r
equire us to reduce the carrying value of our real estate by recording provisions for impairment, it could have a material impact on our results of operations.

The following is a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.



Rental Revenue

Rental revenue was $344.1 million for 2010 versus $323.8 million for 2009, an increase of $20.3 million, or 6.3%. Rental revenue was $323.2 million in 2008. The increase in rental revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 is primarily attributable to:



●The 186 properties acquired by Realty Income in 2010, which generated $15.9 million of rent in 2010;

●The 16 properties acquired by Realty Income in 2009, which generated $5.6 million of rent in 2010 compared to $490,000 in 2009, an increase of $5.1 million;

●Same store rents generated on 2,131 properties during the entire years of 2010 and 2009, increased by $1.8 million, or 0.6%, to $313.8 million from $312.0 million; and

●An increase in straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments to rent of $442,000 in 2010 as compared to 2009; net of

●A  net decrease of $3.1 million relating to the aggregate of (i) development properties acquired before 2009 that started paying rent in 2009, (ii) properties that were vacant during part of 2010 or 2009, (iii) properties sold during 2010 and 2009 and (iv) lease termination settlements, which, in aggregate, totaled $7.16 million in 2010 compared to $10.23 million in 2009.



Of the 2,496 properties in the portfolio at December 31, 2010, 2,485, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. Of the 2,485 single-tenant properties, 2,402, or 96.7%, were net leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 11.4 years at December 31, 2010. Of our 2,402 leased single-tenant properties, 2,217 or 92.3% were under leases that provide for increases in rents through:



●Primarily base rent increases tied to a consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings);

●Overage rent based on a percentage of the tenants' gross sales;

●Fixed increases; or

●A combination of two or more of the above rent provisions.



Percentage rent, which is included in rental revenue, was $1.3 million in 2010, $1.3 million in 2009 and$1.2 million in 2008 (excluding percentage rent reclassified to discontinued operations of $56,000 in 2010, $90,000 in 2009 and $61,000 in 2008). Percentage rent in 2010 was less than 1% of rental revenue and we anticipate percentage rent to be less than 1% of rental revenue in 2011.



Our portfolio of real estate, leased primarily to regional and national commercial enterprises under net leases, continues to perform well and provides dependable lease revenue supporting the payment of monthly dividends to our stockholders.  At December 31, 2010, our portfolio of 2,496 properties was 96.6% leased with 84 properties available for lease as compared to 75 at December 31, 2009. It has been our experience that approximately 2% to 4% of our property portfolio will be unleased at any given time; however, we cannot assure you that the number of properties available for lease will not exceed these levels.



Depreciation and Amortization

Depreciation and amortization was $95.5 million in 2010 versus $90.5 million in 2009 and $89.1 million in 2008. The increases in depreciation and amortization in 2010 and 2009 were primarily due to the acquisition of properties in 2010, 2009 and 2008, which was partially offset by property sales in those same years.  As discussed in the section entitled "Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders," depreciation and amortization is a non-cash item that is added back to net income available to common stockholders for our calculation of FFO and AFFO.

-35-Table of contentsInterest Expense

Interest expense was $93.2 million in 2010 versus $85.5 million in 2009 and $94.0 million in 2008. The increase in interest expense from 2009 to 2010 was primarily due to an increase in borrowings attributable to the issuance of our $250 million of 5.75% senior unsecured notes in June 2010 and utilization of our credit facility in 2010, which was partially offset by lower average interest rates.  The decrease in interest expense from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to lower average outstanding balances and, to a lesser extent, lower interest rates.  We redeemed, in November 2008, the $100 million outstanding principal amount of our 8.25% Monthly Income Senior Notes and, in January 2009, the $20 million outstanding principal amount of our 8% Notes, both of which contributed to the decrease in average outstanding b
alances and lower average interest rates on our debt in 2009.



In December 2010, as a result of entering into our $425 million credit facility, we incurred $4.2 million of credit facility origination costs that were classified in “other assets” on our consolidated balance sheet atDecember 31, 2010, and are being amortized over the term of the credit facility. The remaining credit facility origination costs that were incurred as a result of entering into our previous $355 million credit facility, which were $452,000 at December 31, 2010, are included in “other assets” and are being amortized over the remaining term of our current $425 million credit facility.



The following is a summary of the components of our interest expense (dollars in thousands):

At December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate on our notes payable of $1.6 billion was 6.05%.  There was no outstanding balance on our credit facility at December 31, 2010, but if there was, the effective borrowing rate would have been 2.11%.

Interest Coverage Ratio

Our interest coverage ratio for 2010 was 3.3 times, for 2009 was 3.5 times and for 2008 was 3.2 times.  Interest coverage ratio is calculated as: the interest coverage amount (as calculated in the following table) divided by interest expense, including interest recorded as discontinued operations. We consider interest coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to meet its interest expense obligations. Our calculation of interest coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited. This information should not be considered as an alternative to any GAAP liquidity measures.

Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio

Our fixed charge coverage ratio for 2010 was 2.7 times, for 2009 was 2.7 times and for 2008 was 2.6 times. Fixed charge coverage ratio is calculated in exactly the same manner as interest coverage ratio, except that preferred stock dividends are also added to the denominator. We consider fixed charge coverage ratio to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a company’s ability to make its interest and preferred stock dividend payments. Our calculation of the fixed charge coverage ratio may be different from the calculation used by other companies and, therefore, comparability may be limited.

General and Administrative Expenses

General and administrative expenses increased by $4.4 million to $25.3 million in 2010 as compared to $20.9 million in 2009. General and administrative expenses were $21.6 million in 2008.  In 2010, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue were 7.3% as compared to 6.4% in 2009 and 6.7% in 2008. General and administrative expenses increased during 2010 primarily because of increases in employee costs, particularly in the acquisitions and research departments. In February 2011, we had 79 employees as compared to 72 employees in February 2010.  In accordance with GAAP, 2010 general and administrative expenses also include transaction costs of $368,000 related to the acquisition of 186 new properties during 2010, as compared to $62,000 related to the acquisition of 16 new properties durin
g 2009. Prior to 2009, GAAP required these transaction costs to be capitalized as part of the property investments.

Property Expenses

Property expenses are broken down into costs associated with non-net leased multi-tenant properties, unleased single-tenant properties and general portfolio expenses. Expenses related to the multi-tenant and unleased single-tenant properties include, but are not limited to, property taxes, maintenance, insurance, utilities, property inspections, bad debt expense and legal fees. General portfolio costs include, but are not limited to, insurance, legal, bad debt expense, property inspections and title search fees. At December 31, 2010, 84 properties were available for lease, as compared to 75 at December 31, 2009 and 70 at December 31, 2008.



Property expenses were $7.3 million in 2010, $6.6 million in 2009 and $5.5 million in 2008. The increase in property expenses in 2010 is primarily attributable to an increase in maintenance, utilities and property taxes associated with properties available for lease, partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.



Income Taxes

Income taxes were $1.4 million in 2010 as compared to $677,000 in 2009 and $1.2 million in 2008. These amounts are for city and state income and franchise taxes paid by Realty Income.  Income taxes for 2009 are lower primarily a result of a prior year review of our state tax filings, where we determined that it was appropriate to amend some prior year tax returns from which we realized a tax benefit of $308,000 in 2009.



In addition, Crest recorded state and federal income tax benefits of $344,000 in 2010 as compared to income tax benefits of $645,000 in 2009 and income tax expense of $225,000 in 2008. These amounts are included in "income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest" on our consolidated statements of income. The Crest 2009 tax benefit includes a benefit of $303,000 attributable to amendments of certain prior year state tax returns.



Discontinued Operations

Crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them as investments and operating the properties. Consequently, we typically Crest's assets as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them. As a result, the operations of Crest’s property assets are typically classified as "income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest" on our consolidated statements of income.



However, if we determine we have no plans to sell a property asset in the near term (i.e. within the next 12 months), and this property was previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as real estate held for investment. A property that is reclassified as held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of (i) its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment, or (ii) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.



At December 31, 2010, we determined that three property assets, acquired by Crest in 2006, no longer met the held for sale criteria because we decided to lease rather than sell these properties in the near term.  As a result, investment in real estate of $3.0 million was reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate held for investment on our consolidated  balance sheet at December 31, 2010.  The results of operations for these properties are included in income from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of income.  As a result of this reclassification, $911,000, $214,000 and $3.2 million in operating loss was reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Crest’s Property Sales

During 2010, Crest did not sell any properties.  During 2009, Crest sold two properties for $2.0 million, which resulted in no gain. In 2008, Crest sold 25 properties for $50.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $4.6 million. During 2008, as part of two sales, Crest provided buyer financing of $19.2 million. Crest’s gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations.

-39-Table of contentsGain on Sales of Investment Properties by Realty Income

During 2010, we sold 28 investment properties for $26.6 million, which resulted in a gain of $8.4 million.  The results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations.  Additionally, we sold excess land from one property for $600,000, which resulted in a gain of $271,000.  This gain is included in “other revenue” on our consolidated statement of income for 2010 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations.



During 2009, we sold 25 investment properties for $20.3 million, which resulted in a gain of $8.0 million. The results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations. Additionally, we received proceeds of $170,000 from the sale of excess land from one property, which resulted in a gain of $15,000. This gain is included in "other revenue" on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations.



During 2008, we sold 29 investment properties for $27.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $13.3 million. The results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations.  Additionally, we received proceeds of $439,000 from the sale of excess land from one property, which resulted in a gain of $236,000. This gain is included in "other revenue" on our consolidated statement of income for 2008 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations.



We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



●Generate higher returns;

●Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

●Extend our average remaining lease term; or

●Decrease tenant or industry concentration.



At December 31, 2010, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $3.6 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. Additionally, we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified, from which we anticipate receiving between $10 million and $35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties.



Provisions for Impairment on Real Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest

During 2010, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $807,000 on three properties held for investment at December 31, 2010. These provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2010.



During 2009, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $199,000 on three properties classified as held for investment at December 31, 2010. These provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2009.  Additionally, in 2009, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $78,000 on two properties which were sold in 2009.  These provisions for impairment are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest” on our consolidated statement of income for 2009.



During 2008, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $3.4 million on three properties which were held for investment at December 31, 2010. These provisions for impairment are included in continuing operations on our consolidated statement of income for 2008.

-40-Table of contentsProvisions for Impairment on Realty Income Investment Properties

During 2010, we recorded provisions for impairment of $213,000 on four properties, three which were sold in 2010 and the other is anticipated to be sold in the first quarter of 2011.  These provisions for impairment are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate held for investment” on our consolidated statement of income for 2010.  During 2009, we recorded a provision for impairment of $110,000 on one property, which is included in "income from discontinued operations, real estate held for investment" on our consolidated statement of income for 2009, and the property was sold in 2010. No provisions for impairment were recorded in 2008.



Preferred Stock Dividends

Preferred stock cash dividends totaled $24.3 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008.



Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $106.5 million in 2010, a slight decrease of $343,000 as compared to $106.9 million in 2009. Net income available to common stockholders in 2008 was $107.6 million.



The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties. The amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.



Gain from the sale of investment properties and the sale of excess land recognized during 2010 was$8.7 million, as compared to a $8.1 million gain recognized during 2009 and a $13.6 million gain recognized during 2008. Crest’s recognized no gain from the sale of properties during 2010 or 2009 as compared to$4.6 million during 2008.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (FFO)



FFO for 2010 increased by $3.3 million, or 1.7%, to $193.7 million, as compared to $190.4 million in 2009 and $185.5 million in 2008. The following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):



201020092008Net income available to common stockholders$106,531$106,874$107,588Depreciation and amortization:Continuing operations95,51390,51989,104Discontinued operations6361,4282,701Depreciation of furniture, fixtures and equipment(291)(318)(319)Gain on sales of land and investment properties:Continuing operations(271)(15)(236)Discontinued operations(8,405)(8,044)(13,314)FFO available to common stockholders$193,713$190,444$185,524FFO per common share:Basic$1.83$1.84$1.83Diluted$1.83$1.84$1.83Distributions paid to common stockholders$182,500$178,008$169,655FFO in excess of distributions paid tocommon stockholders$11,213$12,436$15,869Weighted average number of common sharesused for computation per share:Basic105,869,637103,577,507101,178,191Diluted105,942,721103,581,053101,209,883



We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s definition, as net income available to common stockholders, plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, reduced by gains on sales of investment properties and extraordinary items.



We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT’s operating performance as it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that adds back non-cash items such as depreciation. The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation, could be less informative. The use of FFO is recommended by the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. In addition, FFO is used as a measure of our compliance with the financial covenants of our credit facility.



Presentation of this information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO is not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities as a measure of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions or of our ability to pay interest payments.

-42-


ADJUSTED FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS AVAILABLE TO COMMON STOCKHOLDERS (AFFO)



AFFO for 2010 increased by $4.6 million, or 2.4%, to $197.3 million as compared to $192.7 million in 2009 and $192.0 million in 2008. We consider AFFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our performance because it provides analysts and investors with an additional indicator of our ability to pay dividends. Most companies in our industry use a similar measurement, but they may use the term "CAD" (for Cash Available for Distribution) or "FAD" (for Funds Available for Distribution). AFFO further adjusts FFO by adding back non-cash items that reduce net income in accordance with GAAP, and deducting such items as capitalized expenditures and straight-line rent revenue.



The following is a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average number of common shares used for the basic and diluted computation per share (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):

(1)See reconciling items for FFO presented on the previous page.

(2)Amortization of deferred note financing costs includes the amortization of costs incurred and capitalized when our notes were issued in January 1999, March 2003, November 2003, March 2005, September 2005, September 2006, September 2007 and June 2010. These costs are being amortized over the lives of these notes. No costs associated with our credit facility agreements or annual fees paid to credit rating agencies have been included.

(3)The settlement on the treasury lock agreements resulted from an interest rate risk prevention strategy that we used in 1997 and 1998, which correlated to pending issuances of senior note securities.  We have not employed this strategy since 1998.

(4)A negative amount indicates that our straight-line rent revenue was greater than our actual cash rent collected.



Presentation of the information regarding FFO and AFFO is intended to assist the reader in comparing the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO and AFFO in the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and AFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to reviewing our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities.  In addition, FFO and AFFO should not be considered as a measure of liquidity, of our ability to make cash distributions, or of our ability to pay interest payments.

IMPACT OF INFLATION



Tenant leases generally provide for limited increases in rent as a result of increases in the tenants' sales volumes, increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), and/or fixed increases. We expect that inflation will cause these lease provisions to result in rent increases over time. During times when inflation is greater than increases in rent, as provided for in the leases, rent increases may not keep up with the rate of inflation.



Of our 2,496 properties in our portfolio, approximately 96.2% or 2,402 are leased to tenants under net leases where the tenant is responsible for property expenses. Net leases tend to reduce our exposure to rising property expenses due to inflation. Inflation and increased costs may have an adverse impact on our tenants if increases in their operating expenses exceed increases in revenue.



IMPACT OF RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS



For information on the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our business, see note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



Item 7A:Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk



We are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our credit facility and long-term notes and bonds used to maintain liquidity and expand our real estate investment portfolio and operations. Our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flow and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives we issue long-term notes and bonds, primarily at fixed rates. We were not a party to any derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2010. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes.



The following table presents by year of expected maturity, the principal amounts, average interest rates and estimated fair values of our fixed and variable debt as of December 31, 2010. This information is presented to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes (dollars in millions):

(4)$275 million matures in September 2016, $175 million matures in September 2017, $550 million matures in August 2019, $250 million matures in January 2021 and $100 million matures in March 2035.

(5)We base the estimated fair value of the fixed rate debt at December 31, 2010 on the indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable.



The table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of December 31, 2010. It does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date. As a result, our ultimate realized gain or loss, with respect to interest rate fluctuations, would depend on the exposures that arise during the period, our hedging strategies at the time, and interest rates.



All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. Interest on our credit facility balance is variable. At December 31, 2010, our credit facility balance was zero; however, we intend to borrow funds on our credit facility in the future.  Based on a hypothetical credit facility borrowing of $50 million, a 1% change in interest rates would change our interest costs by $500,000 per year.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm





The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:



We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010. In connection with our audits of the consolidated financial statements, we also have audited financial statement schedule III. These consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.



We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.



In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established inInternal Control – Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), and our report dated February 10, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm





The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Realty Income Corporation:



We have audited Realty Income Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established inInternal Control – Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). Realty Income Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanyingManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit
.



We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.



A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.



In our opinion, Realty Income Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established inInternal Control – Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.



We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Realty Income Corporation and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2010, and our report dated February 10, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.

REALTY INCOME CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES

Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements

December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008



1.         Organization and Operation



Realty Income Corporation ("Realty Income," the "Company," "we", "our" or "us") is organized as a Maryland corporation. We invest in commercial real estate and have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT.



At December 31, 2010, we owned 2,496 properties, located in 49 states, containing over 21.2 million leasable square feet, along with three properties owned by our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc., or Crest. Crest was created to buy and sell properties, primarily to individual investors who are involved in tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code.



Information with respect to number of properties, square feet, average initial lease term and weighted average contractual lease rate is unaudited.



2.Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Procedures and Recent Accounting Pronouncements



Federal Income Taxes. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. We believe we have qualified and continue to qualify as a REIT. Under the REIT operating structure, we are permitted to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders and generally will not be required to pay federal corporate income taxes on such income. Accordingly, no provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements, except for the federal income taxes of Crest, which are included in discontinued operations. The income taxes recorded on our consolidated statements of income represent amounts paid by Realty Income for city and state income and franchise taxes.



Earnings and profits that determine the taxability of distributions to stockholders differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes due to differences in the estimated useful lives and methods used to compute depreciation and the carrying value (basis) of the investments in properties for tax purposes, among other things.



The following reconciles our net income available to common stockholders to taxable income (dollars in thousands):

2010(1)20092008Net income available to common stockholders$106,531$106,874$107,588Preferred stock cash dividends24,25324,25324,253Depreciation and amortization timing differences22,90527,09428,624Tax gain on the sales of real estate less than book gain--(5,436)(4,518)Tax loss on the sale of real estate less than book gain(10,063)----Dividends received from Crest----2,500Elimination of net revenue and expenses from Crest1,337378270Adjustment for share-based compensation5621,8242,270Adjustment for straight-line rent(1,613)(1,117)(1,997)Adjustment for an increase (decrease) in prepaid rent4,2231,273(1,226)Other adjustments3,579(752)(321)Taxable net income, before our dividends paid deduction$151,714$154,391$157,443



(1)The 2010 information presented is a reconciliation of our net income available to common stockholders to estimated taxable net income.



We regularly analyze our various federal and state filing positions and only recognize the income tax effect in our financial statements when certain criteria regarding uncertain income tax positions have been met. We believe that our income tax positions would more likely than not be sustained upon examination by all relevant taxing authorities. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded in our financial statements.



-52-




Net Income Per Common Share. Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average number of common shares that would have been outstanding assuming the issuance of common shares for all potentially dilutive common shares outstanding during the reporting period.



The following is a reconciliation of the denominator of the basic net income per common share computation to the denominator of the diluted net income per common share computation:

Other Liabilities.Other liabilities consist of the following (dollars in thousands) at:

Discontinued Operations. Operations from nine of our investment properties were classified as held for sale at December 31, 2010, plus properties sold in 2010, 2009 and 2008, are reported as discontinued operations. Their respective results of operations have been reclassified to "income from discontinued operations, real estate held for investment" on our consolidated statements of income. We do not depreciate properties that are classified as held for sale.



Crest acquires properties with the intention of reselling them rather than holding them for investment and operating the properties. Consequently, we typically classify Crest's assets as held for sale at the date of acquisition and do not depreciate them. As a result, the operations of Crest's property assets are typically classified as "income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest" on our consolidated statements of income.



However, if we determine we have no plans to sell a property asset in the near term (i.e. within the next 12 months), and this property was previously classified as held for sale, the property is reclassified as real estate held for investment. A property that is reclassified to held for investment is measured and recorded at the lower of (i) its carrying amount before the property was classified as held for sale, adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held for investment, or (ii) the fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell.



At December 31, 2010, we determined that three property assets, acquired by Crest in 2006, no longer met the held for sale criteria because we decided to lease rather than sell these properties in the near term.  As a result, investment in real estate of $3.0 million was reclassified from real estate held for sale to real estate held for investment on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010.  At December 31, 2009, Crest’s property inventory consisted of three properties valued at $3.8 million, all of which was held for sale and included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009, in "real estate held for sale, net." The results of operations for these properties are included in "income from continuing operations" on our consolidated statements of income.  As a result of this reclassification, $911,000, $214,000 and $3.2 millio
n in operating loss was reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



No debt was assumed by buyers of our investment properties, or repaid as a result of our investment property sales, and we do not allocate interest expense to discontinued operations related to real estate held for investment. We allocate interest expense related to borrowings specifically attributable to Crest's properties.  The interest expense amounts allocated to the Crest properties held for sale are included in "income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for resale by Crest" on our consolidated statements of income.

The per share amounts for "income from discontinued operations" above and the "income from continuing operations" and "net income" reported on the consolidated statements of income have each been calculated independently.



Revenue Recognition and Accounts Receivable. All leases are accounted for as operating leases. Under this method, lease payments that have fixed and determinable rent increases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Any rental revenue contingent upon a tenant's sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint. Rental increases based upon changes in the consumer price indexes are recognized only after the changes in the indexes have occurred and are then applied according to the lease agreements.



We recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts relating to accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible. We consider tenant specific issues, such as financial stability and ability to pay, when determining collectibility of accounts receivable and appropriate allowances to record. Our allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2010 was $1.1 million and at December 31, 2009 was $865,000.



-55-


Other revenue includes non-operating interest earned from investments in money market funds and other notes of $96,000 in 2010, $51,000 in 2009 and $1.4 million in 2008.



Principles of Consolidation. The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Realty Income, Crest and other entities for which we make operating and financial decisions (i.e. control), after elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions. All of Realty Income's subsidiaries are wholly-owned. We have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in variable interest entities.



Cash Equivalents. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to cash and have an original maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents are primarily investments in United States Treasury or government money market funds.



Gain on Sales of Properties. When real estate is sold, the related net book value of the applicable assets is removed and a gain from the sale is recognized in our consolidated statements of income. We record a gain from the sale of real estate provided that various criteria, relating to the terms of the sale and any subsequent involvement by us with the real estate, have been met.



Allocation of the Purchase Price of Real Estate Acquisitions. When acquiring a property for investment purposes, we allocate the fair value of real estate acquired to: 1) land and 2) building and improvements, based in each case on their estimated fair values.



For properties acquired with in-place operating leases, the fair value of real estate is allocated to: 1) land, 2) building and improvements, and 3) identified intangible assets and liabilities, based in each case on their estimated fair values. Intangible assets and liabilities consist of above-market and below-market leases, the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships.



Our estimated fair value determinations are based on management's judgment, which is based on various factors, including: (1) market conditions, (2) industry that tenant operates in, (3) characteristics of the real estate, i.e.: location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, (4) tenant credit profile, (5) store profitability and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant's business, and/or (6) real estate appraisals, prepared by an independent appraisal firm.  When real estate appraisals are utilized, the measurement of fair value related to the allocation of the purchase price of real estate acquisitions is derived principally from observable market data that is not readily available to the public (and thus should be categorized as level 2 on FASB's three-level valuation hi
erarchy).  Our other methodologies for measuring fair value related to the allocation of the purchase price of real estate acquisitions (except for independent third-party real estate appraisals) include unobservable inputs that reflect our own internal assumptions and calculations (and thus should be categorized as level 3 on FASB's three-level valuation hierarchy).



The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property (which includes land and buildings/improvements) is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the "as-if-vacant" value is then allocated to land and buildings/improvements based on our determination of the relative fair value of these assets. Our fair value determinations are based on a real estate appraisal for each property, prepared by an independent appraisal firm, and consider estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases. In allocating the fair value to identified intangibles for above-market or below-market leases, an amount is recorded based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place l
ease and (ii) our estimate of fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease.



Capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods.



The aggregate value of other acquired intangible assets consists of the value of in-place leases and tenant relationships. These are measured by the excess of the purchase price paid for a property, after adjusting for above or below-market lease value, less the estimated fair value of the property "as if vacant," determined as set forth above. The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases. If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recorded to revenue or expense as appropriate.

-56-Table of contentsDepreciation and Amortization. Land, buildings and improvements are recorded and stated at cost. Major replacements and betterments, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives, while ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Buildings and improvements that are under redevelopment, or are being developed, are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets. Additionally, amounts essential to the development of the property, such as pre-construction, development, construction, interest and any other costs incurred during the period of development are capitalized. We cease capitalization when the property is available for occupancy upon substantial completion of tenant improvements, but in any event no later than one year from the completion of major construction activity.



Properties are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.  The estimated useful lives are as follows:



BuildingsTypically 25 yearsBuilding improvements4 to 15 yearsTenant improvements and lease commissionsThe shorter of the term of the related lease or useful lifeAcquired in-place leasesRemaining terms of the respective leases



Provisions for Impairment. We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impairment is recorded if estimated future operating cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) plus estimated disposition proceeds (undiscounted) are less than the current book value of the property. Key factors that we use in this analysis include: projected rental rates, capital expenditures and property sales capitalization rates. Additionally, a property classified as held for sale is carried at the lower of carrying cost or estimated fair value, less estimated cost to sell.



In 2010, Realty Income recorded total provisions for impairment of $213,000 on three properties in the restaurant industry and one property in the child care industry.  These provisions for impairment are included in “income from discontinued operations, real estate held for investment” on our consolidated statement of income for 2010, as three of the properties were subsequently sold and one is anticipated to be sold in the first quarter of 2011.  During 2010, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $807,000 on three properties held for investment at December 31, 2010.  These provisions for impairment are included in "income from continuing operations" on our consolidated statement of income for 2010.



In 2009, we recorded a provision for impairment of $110,000 on one property in the convenience store industry, which was sold during 2010. This provision for impairment is included in "income from discontinued operations, real estate held for investment" on our consolidated statement of income for 2009. Additionally, in 2009, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $199,000 on three properties classified as held for investment at December 31, 2010.  These provisions for impairment are included in "income from continuing operations" on our consolidated statement of income for 2009.  Additionally, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $78,000 on two properties which were sold in 2009. These provisions for impairment are included in "income from discontinued operations, real estate acquired for res
ale by Crest" on our consolidated statement of income for 2009.



No provisions for impairment were recorded by Realty Income in 2008. In 2008, Crest recorded total provisions for impairment of $3.4 million on three properties, which were held for investment at December 31, 2010. These provisions for impairment are included in "income from continuing operations" on our consolidated statement of income for 2008.



Asset Retirement Obligations.We analyze our future legal obligations associated with the other-than-temporary removal of tangible long-lived assets, also referred to as asset retirement obligations. When we determine that we have a legal obligation to provide services upon the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset, we record a liability for this obligation based on the estimated fair market value of this obligation and adjust the carrying amount of the related long-lived asset by the same amount. This asset is amortized over its estimated useful life. The estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligation is calculated by discounting the future cash flows using a credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate.



-57-


Goodwill. Goodwill is tested for impairment during the second quarter of each year as well as when events or circumstances occur indicating that our goodwill might be impaired.  During our tests for impairment of goodwill, during the second quarters of 2010, 2009 and 2008, we determined that the estimated fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying values.  We did not record any new goodwill or impairment on our existing goodwill during 2010, 2009 or 2008.



Sales Taxes.We collect and remit sales taxes assessed by different governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a revenue-producing transaction between us and our tenants. We report the collection of these taxes on a net basis (excluded from revenues). The amounts of these taxes are not significant to our financial position or results of operations.



Use of Estimates. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.



Impact of Recent Accounting Pronouncements.In December 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805),Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. Effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2010, ASC No. 2010-29 specifies that if a public entity enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis and presents comparative financial statements, the entity must present pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination(s) that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior
 annual reporting period only.  ASU No. 2010-29 only applies to our disclosures in note 3 related to acquisitions and is not expected to have a significant impact on our footnote disclosures.



Reclassifications. Certain of the 2009 and 2008 balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2010 presentation.



3.           Properties Acquired



We acquire the land, buildings and improvements that are necessary for the successful operations of retail and other commercial enterprises.



A.  During 2010, Realty Income invested $713.5 million in 186 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.9%. These 186 properties are located in 14 states, contain over 2.2 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 15.7 years. The initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed by dividing the estimated aggregate base rent for the first year of each lease by the estimated total cost of the properties. In accordance with GAAP, acquisition transaction costs of $368,000 were recorded to "general and administrative" expense on our consolidated statement of income for 2010.



Included in the $713.5 million invested during 2010 are the following acquisitions:



(1)The acquisition and lease-back of approximately $304.1 million of winery and vineyard properties under 20-year, triple-net lease arrangements with Diageo Chateau & Estates Wine Company, guaranteed by Diageo plc (NYSE: ADR: DEO), or, together with its subsidiaries, Diageo.  The properties are primarily located in California’s Napa Valley and include two wineries that produce wines for Diageo’s Sterling Vineyards, or Sterling, and Beaulieu Vineyards, or BV, brands and 14 vineyards producing grapes for their Sterling, BV and other brands.  The properties include approximately 3,600 acres and 426,000 square feet of winery, production, storage, shipping and tourist buildings.  Diageo will continue to operate the wineries and vineyards.

(2)The acquisition of 23 retail properties leased to 13 tenants in six states, for approximately $126.5 million, under long-term, net lease agreements.  The properties are in eight different industries, all of which are already in our portfolio.  All of the properties acquired have in-place leases.



-58-


(3)The acquisition of 135 SuperAmerica convenience stores and one support facility, for approximately $247.6 million, under long-term, triple-net lease agreements.  The stores are located in Minnesota and Wisconsin, and average approximately 3,500 leasable square feet on approximately 1.14 acres.

(4)The remaining 11 properties acquired totaled approximately $35.3 million.



The 2010 aggregate acquisitions were allocated as follows: $358.3 million to land, $339.8 million to buildings and improvements, $17.0 million to intangible assets and $1.6 million to intangible liabilities.  All of the acquisitions were cash purchases and there were no contingent considerations associated with these acquisitions.



Total revenues of $16.0 million and income from continuing operations of $12.1 million are included in the 2010 consolidated income statement for the aggregate 2010 acquisitions.



The following pro forma total revenue and income from continuing operations of the 2010 acquisitions in aggregate, assumes the acquisitions had taken place on January 1, 2010 for the 2010 pro forma information, and on January 1, 2009 for the 2009 pro forma information (in millions):

Total revenueIncome fromcontinuing operationsSupplemental pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2010(1)$385.4$137.7Supplemental pro forma for the year ended December 31, 2009(1)$381.6$142.3



(1)This unaudited pro forma supplemental information does not purport to be indicative of what our operating results would have been had the acquisitions occurred on January 1, 2010 or January 1, 2009, and may not be indicative of future operating results.



In comparison, during 2009, Realty Income invested $57.9 million in 16 new properties with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 9.7%. These 16 properties are located in five states, contain over 278,000 leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 17.9 years.  In accordance with GAAP, acquisition transaction costs of $62,000 were recorded to "general and administrative" expense on our consolidated statement of income for 2009.



B.  During 2010 and 2009, Crest did not invest in any new properties.



C.  Of the $713.5 million invested by Realty Income in 2010, approximately $126.5 million was used to acquire 23 properties with existing leases.  Realty Income recorded $12.6 million as the intangible value of the in-place leases, $4.4 million as the intangible value of above-market leases and $1.6 million as the intangible value of below-market leases for 2010.  The value of the in-place and above-market leases are recorded to "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31, 2010, and the value of the below-market leases are recorded to "other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2010.  All of these amounts are amortized over the life of the respective leases.



Of the $57.9 million invested by Realty Income in 2009, $10.5 million was used to acquire three properties with existing leases. Realty Income recorded $1.4 million as the intangible value of the in-place leases, $150,000 as the intangible value of above-market leases and $655,000 as the intangible value of below-market leases for 2009. The value of the in-place and above-market leases are recorded to "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet, as of December 31, 2009, and the value of the below-market leases are recorded to "other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2009. All of these amounts are amortized over the life of the respective leases.



4.           Credit Facility



In December 2010, we entered into a new $425 million revolving, unsecured credit facility that replaced our previous $355 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in May 2011. The initial term of the new credit facility expires in March 2014 and includes two, one-year extension options. Under the new credit facility, our investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR. We also have other interest rate options available to us. Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.

In December 2010, as a result of entering into our current credit facility, we incurred $4.2 million of credit facility origination costs that were classified as part of "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet atDecember 31, 2010 and are being amortized over the term of the credit facility.  The remaining credit facility origination costs that were incurred as a result of entering into our previous $355 million credit facility, which were $452,000 at December 31, 2010, are included in "other assets" and are being amortized over the remaining term of our current $425 million credit facility.



The average borrowing rate on our credit facility was 1.3% during 2010. During 2009, we did not utilize our credit facility until December and, during 2008, we did not utilize our credit facility. Our effective borrowing rate at December 31, 2010 was 2.1% and at December 31, 2009 was 1.2%. Our current and prior credit facilities are and were subject to various leverage and interest coverage ratio limitations. We are and have been in compliance with these covenants.

9.           Operating Leases



A.    At December 31, 2010, we owned 2,496 properties in 49 states, plus an additional three properties owned by Crest. Of the 2,496 properties, 2,485, or 99.6%, are single-tenant, properties and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant, distribution and office properties. At December 31, 2010, 84 properties were vacant and available for lease or sale.



Substantially all leases are net leases where the tenant pays property taxes and assessments, maintains the interior and exterior of the building and leased premises, and carries insurance coverage for public liability, property damage, fire and extended coverage.



Rent based on a percentage of a tenants' gross sales (percentage rents) for 2010 was $1.4 million, for 2009 was $1.3 million and for 2008 was $1.3 million, including amounts recorded to discontinued operations of $56,000 in 2010, $90,000 in 2009 and $61,000 in 2008.



At December 31, 2010, minimum future annual rents to be received on the operating leases for the next five years and thereafter are as follows (dollars in thousands):



2011$373,7872012360,3382013346,0732014328,3182015314,855Thereafter2,637,944Total$4,361,315



B.    Major Tenants - No individual tenant's rental revenue, including percentage rents, represented more than 10% of our total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 or 2008.



10.           Gain on Sales of Real Estate Acquired for Resale by Crest



During 2010, Crest did not sell any properties.  During 2009, Crest sold two properties for $2.0 million, which resulted in no gain. During 2008, Crest sold 25 properties for $50.7 million, which resulted in a gain of $4.6 million. In 2008, as part of two sales, Crest provided buyer financing of $19.2 million. Crest's gains on sales are reported before income taxes and are included in discontinued operations.

-63-Table of contents11.           Gain on Sales of Investment Properties by Realty Income



During 2010, we sold 28 investment properties for $26.6 million, which resulted in a gain of $8.4 million.  The results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations.  Additionally, we sold excess land from one property for $600,000, which resulted in a gain of $271,000.  This gain is included in"other revenue"on our consolidated statement of income for 2010 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations.



During 2009, we sold 25 investment properties for $20.3 million, which resulted in a gain of $8.0 million. The results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations. Additionally, we received proceeds of $170,000 from the sale of excess land from one property, which resulted in a gain of $15,000. This gain is included in "other revenue" on our consolidated statement of income for 2009 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations.



During 2008, we sold 29 investment properties for $27.4 million, which resulted in a gain of $13.3 million. The results of operations for these properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations.  Additionally, we received proceeds of $439,000 from the sale of excess land from one property, which resulted in a gain of $236,000. This gain is included in "other revenue" on our consolidated statement of income for 2008 because this excess land was associated with a property that continues to be owned as part of our core operations.



12.           Fair Value of Financial Instruments



Fair value is defined as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The disclosure for assets and liabilities measured at fair value requires allocation to a three-level valuation hierarchy. This valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. Categorization within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.



We believe that the carrying values reflected in our consolidated balance sheets reasonably approximate the fair values for cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, and all liabilities, due to their short-term nature, except for our notes receivable issued in connection with property sales and our notes payable, which are disclosed below (dollars in millions):

Carrying value perEstimated fairAt December 31, 2010balance sheetmarket valueNotes receivable issued in connection with Crest property sales$22.1$23.2Notes payable$1,600.0$1,707.1



Carrying value perEstimated fairAt December 31, 2009balance sheetmarket valueNotes receivable issued in connection with Crest property sales$22.2$20.0Notes payable$1,350.0$1,276.4



The estimated fair value of our notes receivable, issued in connection with property sales, has been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using an interest rate based upon the current 5-year or 7-year Treasury Yield Curve, plus an applicable credit-adjusted spread. These notes receivable were issued in connection with the sale of three Crest properties. Payments to us on these notes receivable are current and no allowance for doubtful accounts has been recorded for them.



The estimated fair value of our notes payable is based upon indicative market prices and recent trading activity of our notes payable.

-64-Table of contents13.           Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information



Interest paid in 2010 was $82.6 million, in 2009 was $83.2 million and in 2008 was $90.3 million.

C.At December 31, 2010, Realty Income had escrow deposits of $6.4 million held for tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code.  The $6.4 million is included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010.



D.At December 31, 2009, Realty Income had escrow deposits of $4.5 million held for tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code. The $4.5 million is included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009.



E.At December 31, 2008, Realty Income had escrow deposits of $3.2 million held for tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Code.  The $3.2 million is included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2008.



F.In 2010, Realty Income recorded a $799,000 receivable for the sale of an investment property as a result of an eminent domain action and recorded a $600,000 receivable for the sale of excess land from an investment property.  These receivables are included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2010.



G.At December 31, 2009, Realty Income recorded $1.5 million for a new environmental insurance policy, which supplements its primary insurance policy.  The $1.5 million is included in "other assets" and "accounts payable and accrued expenses" on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2009.



H.In 2009, Realty Income and Crest amended certain prior year state tax returns and determined that it is more-likely-than-not that we will be collecting refunds in the future as a result of these amendments.  As a result of this, in 2009, Realty Income recorded a tax receivable of $454,000 and Crest recorded a tax receivable of $303,000.



I.In 2008, Crest sold two properties for $23.5 million and received notes totaling $19.2 million from the buyers, which are included in "other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets.

These asset retirement obligations account for the difference between our obligations to the landlord under the two land leases and our subtenant's obligations to us under the subleases.



K.Accrued costs on properties under development resulted in an increase in buildings and improvements and accounts payable of $337,000 at December 31, 2010.

14.           Employee Benefit Plan



We have a 401(k) plan covering substantially all of our employees. Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to make contributions to the plan up to a maximum of 60% of their compensation, subject to limits under the Code. We match 50% of our employee's contributions, up to 3% of the employee's compensation. Our aggregate matching contributions each year have been immaterial to our results of operations.



15.           Common Stock Incentive Plan



In 2003, our Board of Directors adopted, and stockholders approved, the 2003 Incentive Award Plan of Realty Income Corporation, or the Stock Plan, to enable us to attract and retain the services of directors, employees and consultants, considered essential to our long-term success. The Stock Plan offers our directors, employees and consultants an opportunity to own stock in Realty Income and/or rights that will reflect our growth, development and financial success. The Stock Plan was amended and restated by our Board of Directors in February 2006 and in May 2007. Under the terms of this plan, the aggregate number of shares of our common stock subject to options, stock purchase rights, or SPR, stock appreciation rights, or SAR, and other awards will be no more than 3,428,000 shares. The maximu
m number of shares that may be subject to options, SPR, SAR and other awards granted under the plan to any individual in any calendar year may not exceed 1,600,000 shares. This plan has a term of 10 years from the date it was adopted by our Board of Directors, which was March 12, 2003. To date, we have not issued any SPR or SAR.



The amount of share-based compensation costs recognized in "general and administrative expense" on our consolidated statements of income during 2010 was $6.2 million, during 2009 was $4.7 million and during 2008 was $5.0 million.



The following table summarizes our common stock grant activity under our Stock Plan. Our common stock grants vest over periods ranging from immediately to 10 years.

(1)Grant date fair value.



During 2010, we issued 278,200 shares of common stock under our Stock Plan. These shares vest over the following service periods: 32,000 vested immediately, 5,000 vest over a service period of two years, 12,000 vest over a service period of three years, 50,000 vest over a service period of four years and 179,200 vest over a service period of five years.



The vesting schedule for shares granted to non-employee directors is as follows:



-For directors with less than six years of service at the date of grant, shares vest in 33.33% increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the date the shares of stock are granted;

-For directors with six years of service at the date of grant, shares vest in 50% increments on each of the first two anniversaries of the date the shares of stock are granted;

-For directors with seven years of service at the date of grant, shares are 100% vested on the first anniversary of the date the shares of stock are granted; and





-66-


-For directors with eight or more years of service at the date of grant, there is immediate vesting as of the date the shares of stock are granted.The vesting schedule for shares granted to employees is as follows:



-For employees age 55 and below at the grant date, shares vest in 20% increments on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date;

-For employees age 56 at the grant date, shares vest in 25% increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date;

-For employees age 57 at the grant date, shares vest in 33.33% increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date;

-For employees age 58 at the grant date, shares vest in 50% increments on each of the first two anniversaries of the grant date;

-For employees age 59 at the grant date, shares are 100% vested on the first anniversary of the grant date; and

-For employees age 60 and above at the grant date, shares vest immediately on the grant date.



In addition, after they have been employed for six full months, all non-executive employees receive 200 shares of nonvested stock which vests over a five year period.



As of December 31, 2010, the remaining unamortized share-based compensation expense totaled $18.2 million, which is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period of each applicable award. The amount of share-based compensation is based on the fair value of the stock at the grant date. We define the grant date as the date the recipient and Realty Income have a mutual understanding of the key terms and condition of the award, and the recipient of the grant begins to benefit from, or be adversely affected by, subsequent changes in the price of the shares.



Due to a historically low turnover rate, we do not estimate a forfeiture rate for our nonvested shares. Accordingly, unexpected forfeitures will lower share-based compensation expense during the applicable period. Under the terms of our Stock Plan, we pay non-refundable dividends to the holders of our nonvested shares. Applicable accounting guidance requires that the dividends paid to holders of these nonvested shares be charged as compensation expense to the extent that they relate to nonvested shares that do not or are not expected to vest. However, since we do not estimate forfeitures given our historical trends, we did not record any amount to compensation expense related to dividends paid in 2010, 2009 or 2008.



No stock options were granted after January 1, 2002, all outstanding options were fully vested as ofDecember 31, 2006, and 2006 represented the last year for which we recorded expense on our stock option awards. Stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the underlying stock's fair value at the date of grant. The outstanding stock options expire on December 31, 2011, ten years from the date they were granted and have an exercise price of $14.70.

The intrinsic value of a stock option is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock at December 31 of each year exceeds the exercise price of the option. The market value of our stock was $34.20, $25.91 and $23.15 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $61,000, $157,000 and $319,000, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding and exercisable was $48,000, $66,000 and $209,000 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.



16.           Segment Information



We evaluate performance and make resource allocation decisions on an industry by industry basis. For financial reporting purposes, we have grouped our tenants into 33 industry and activity segments (including properties owned by Crest that are grouped together as a segment). All of the properties are incorporated into one of the applicable segments. Because almost all of our leases require the tenant to pay operating expenses, revenue is the only component of segment profit and loss we measure.

17.           Commitments and Contingencies



In the ordinary course of our business, we are party to various legal actions which we believe are routine in nature and incidental to the operation of our business. We believe that the outcome of the proceedings will not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated financial position or results of operations.



At December 31, 2010, we have contingent payments of $4.2 million for tenant improvements and leasing costs. In addition, we have committed $420,000 under construction contracts, which is expected to be paid in the next three months.



We have certain properties that are subject to ground leases which are accounted for as operating leases.  Our tenants, who are generally sub-tenants under the ground leases, are responsible for paying the rent under these ground leases.  In the event a tenant fails to pay the ground lease rent, we are primarily responsible.  At December 31, 2010, minimum future rental payments for the next five years and thereafter under these ground leases are as follows (dollars in thousands):



2011$3,63120123,52720133,38520143,15020153,096Thereafter31,933Total$48,722



18.           Subsequent Events



In January 2011 and February 2011, we declared the following dividends, which will be paid in February 2011 and March 2011, respectively:



-$0.14425 per share to our common stockholders;

-$0.1536459 per share to our Class D preferred stockholders; and

-$0.140625 per share to our Class E preferred stockholders.

(1)The consolidated quarterly financial data includes revenues and expenses from our continuing and discontinued operations. The results of operations related to certain properties, classified as held for sale or disposed of, have been reclassified to income from discontinued operations. Therefore, some of the information may not agree to our previously filed 10-Qs.

(2)Amounts for each period are calculated independently. The sum of the quarters may differ from the annual amount.



Item 9:Changes In and Disagreements With Accountants on Accounting and FinancialDisclosure



We have had no disagreements with our independent registered public accounting firm on accounting matters or financial disclosure, nor have we changed accountants in the two most recent fiscal years.

Item 9A:Controls and Procedures



Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control obj
ectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.



As of and for the year ended December 31, 2010, we carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Based on the foregoing, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective and were operating at a reasonable assurance level.



Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting

Internal control over financial reporting refers to the process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:



(1) Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;



(2) Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and



(3) Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.



Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company.



Management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled "Internal Control--Integrated Framework" published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Management has concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the most recent fiscal year.  KPMG LLP has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Changes in Internal Controls

There have not been any significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect these controls subsequent to the date of their evaluation in the fourth quarter of 2010. As of December 31, 2010, there were no material weaknesses in our internal controls, and therefore, no corrective actions were taken.



Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls

Internal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Internal control over financial reporting is a process that involves human diligence and compliance and is subject to lapses in judgment and breakdowns resulting from human failures. Internal control over financial reporting also can be circumvented by collusion or improper management override. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting. However, these inherent limitations are known features of the financial reporting process. Therefore, it is possible to design into the process safeguards to reduce, though not eliminate, this risk.
