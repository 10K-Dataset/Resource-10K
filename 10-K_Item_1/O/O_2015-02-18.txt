Item 1:Business



THE COMPANY



Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company®, is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations. Our monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow from our property portfolio. We have in-house acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting, information technology, and capital markets capabilities. Over the past 46 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements.



Realty Income (NYSE: O) was founded in 1969, and listed in 1994 on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE.  We elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).



We seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders, through active portfolio management, asset management and the acquisition of additional properties.



Generally, our portfolio and asset management efforts seek to achieve:



·Contractual rent increases on existing leases;

·Rent increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions permit;

·Active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant properties, and selectively selling properties thereby mitigating our exposure to certain tenants and markets;

·Maximized asset-level returns on sold properties;

·Optimized value on existing portfolio by enhancing individual properties, pursuing alternative uses, and deriving ancillary revenue; and

·Investment opportunities in new asset classes for the portfolio.



At December 31, 2014, we owned a diversified portfolio:



·Of 4,327 properties;

·With an occupancy rate of 98.4%, or 4,257 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease;

·Leased to 234 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries;

·Located in 49 states and Puerto Rico;

·With over 70.7 million square feet of leasable space; and

·With an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,350 square feet, including approximately 11,290 square feet per retail property and 196,800 square feet per industrial and distribution property.



Of the 4,327 properties in the portfolio, 4,308, or 99.6%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining nineteen are multi-tenant properties. At December 31, 2014, of the 4,308 single-tenant properties, 4,238 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 10.2 years.



Our nine senior officers owned 0.3% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $31.1 million at January 31, 2015. Our directors and nine senior officers, as a group, owned 0.4% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $46.4 million at January 31, 2015.



Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “O” with a CUSIP number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is 726728.



Our 6.625% Monthly Income Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or the Class F preferred stock,  is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “OprF” with a CUSIP number of 756109-807.



In January 2015, we had 125 employees, as compared to 116 employees in January 2014.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 46-year policy of paying monthly dividends.  In addition, we increased the dividend four times during 2014, and two times during 2015.  As of February 2015, we have paid 69 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 79 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.

The dividends paid per share during 2014 as compared to 2013 increased 2.1%.  The 2014 dividends paid per share totaled $2.1916254, as compared to $2.1474587 in 2013, an increase of $0.0441667.



The monthly dividend of $0.189 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $2.268 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 4.2% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $54.31 on January 31, 2015. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.



Acquisitions during 2014

During 2014, we invested $1.4 billion in 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.1%. The 506 new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in 42 states, will contain approximately 9.8 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of 12.8 years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in 32 industries and the property types consist of 85.7% retail, 6.6% industrial and distribution, 6.4% office, and 1.3% manufacturing, based on rental revenue.  During 2014, none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10.0% or more of our total assets at December 31, 2014.



The estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate base rent under the lease for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.



In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return.  When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. Of the $1.4 billion we invested during 2014, $81.9 million was invested in 40 properties under development or expansion with an estimated initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 8.4%.  We may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.

Portfolio Discussion



Leasing Results

At December 31, 2014, we had 70 properties available for lease out of 4,327 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 98.4% occupancy rate.  Since December 31, 2013, when we reported 70 properties available for lease out of 3,896 and a 98.2% occupancy rate, we:



·Had 220 lease expirations;

·Re-leased 203 properties; and

·Sold 17 vacant properties.



Of the 203 properties re-leased during 2014, 173 properties were re-leased to existing tenants, nine were re-leased to new tenants without vacancy, and 21 were re-leased to new tenants after a period of vacancy.  The annual rent on these 203 leases was $33.9 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $34.2 million.



At December 31, 2014, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $13.07 per square foot on the 4,257 leased properties in our portfolio.  At December 31, 2014, we classified eight properties with a carrying amount of $14.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet.  The disposal of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results.



Investments in Existing Properties

In 2014, we capitalized costs of $6.0 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $821,000 for re-leasing costs and $5.2 million for building and tenant improvements.  In 2013, we capitalized costs of $8.5 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.3 million for re-leasing costs and $7.2 million for building and tenant improvements.



As part of our re-leasing costs, we typically pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  Leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.



The majority of our building and tenant improvements relate to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  It is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  The amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.



Note Issuance

In September 2014, we issued $250 million of 4.125% senior unsecured notes due October 2026, or the 2026 Notes.  The price to the investors for the 2026 Notes was 99.499% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 4.178% per annum.  A portion of the total net proceeds of approximately $246.4 million from this offering was used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, and the remaining proceeds were used for other general corporate purposes and working capital, including additional property acquisitions.



In June 2014, we issued $350 million of 3.875% senior unsecured notes due July 2024, or the 2024 Notes.  The price to the investors for the 2024 Notes was 99.956% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 3.88% per annum.  The total net proceeds of approximately $346.7 million from this offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility.



Redemption of Preferred Stock

In October 2014, we redeemed all 8,800,000 shares of our 6.75% Monthly Income Class E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, or the Class E preferred stock, for $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends. We incurred a non-cash charge of $6.0 million. This charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006.

Issuance of Common Stock

In April 2014, we issued 13,800,000 shares of common stock, including 1,800,000 shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $22.8 million, the net proceeds of $528.6 million were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility.



Modifications to Compensation Program

In April 2014, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors made modifications to the existing compensation program.  The modified compensation program now consists of distinct short-term and long-term incentive plans based on separate metrics.  The redesigned short-term incentive plan includes a mix of cash and equity awards.  Under the long-term incentive plan, awards are granted in performance-vesting equity awards, which vest based strictly on achieving future performance goals.  With respect to the performance based restricted shares, the award is based on objective performance metrics and determined primarily by relative stockholder return metrics with a smaller component based on balance sheet metrics.  As part of this new program, the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors granted performance-vesting shares with an approximate grant date fair value of $3.0 million to our executive officers in April 2014.



Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

In March 2011, we established a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, or the DRSPP, to provide our common stockholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method of purchasing our common stock and reinvesting their distributions.  The DRSPP also allows our current stockholders to buy additional shares of common stock by reinvesting all or a portion of their distributions.  The DRSPP authorizes up to 6,000,000 common shares to be issued.  During 2014, we issued 3,527,166 shares and raised approximately $158.5 million under the DRSPP.



Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $227.6 million in 2014, compared to $203.6 million in 2013, an increase of $24.0 million. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.04 in 2014, as compared to $1.06 in 2013, a decrease of $0.02, or 1.9%.  Net income available to common stockholders for 2014 includes a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of Class E preferred stock that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis. This charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006. Net income available to common stockholders for 2013 was impacted by an unusually large gain on property sales, which represents $0.18 on a diluted per common share basis.  Additionally, net income available to common stockholders for 2013 includes $13.0 million of merger-related costs for the acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust Inc., or ARCT, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis, and $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in July 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.



The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties. The amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.



Gains from the sale of properties during 2014 were $42.1 million, as compared to gains from the sale of properties of $64.7 million during 2013.



Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO)

In 2014, our FFO increased by $100.9 million, or 21.8%, to $562.9 million versus $462.0 million in 2013.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $2.58 in 2014, compared to $2.41 in 2013, an increase of $0.17, or 7.1%.  FFO in 2014 includes a non-cash redemption charge of $6.0 million on the shares of Class E preferred stock that were redeemed in October 2014, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis. This charge is for the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class E preferred stock and represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2006.  FFO in 2013 was normalized to exclude $13.0 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.07 on a diluted per common share basis.  FFO for 2013 includes $3.7 million for accelerated vesting of restricted shares that occurred in July 2013 from ten-year vesting to five years, which represents $0.02 on a diluted per common share basis.   All references to FFO for 2013 reflect the adjustments for merger-related costs for the acquisition of ARCT.

Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO)

In 2014, our AFFO increased by $98.6 million, or 21.3%, to $561.7 million versus $463.1 million in 2013. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was $2.57 in 2014, compared to $2.41 in 2013, an increase of $0.16, or 6.6%.

DIVIDEND POLICY



Distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock and Class F preferred stock if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.



Distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P. and Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders.



In order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2014, our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled $519.1 million, or approximately 154.6% of our estimated taxable income of $335.7 million. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance.  We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. Our 2014 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $479.3 million, representing 85.3% of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of $561.7 million.



The Class F preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.625% per annum on the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.65625 per annum per share). Dividends on our Class F preferred stock are current.



Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.



Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year).



-6-








Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 24.8% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2014, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. We estimate that in 2015, between 20% and 35% of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital.



BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY



Investment Philosophy

We believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), (2) fixed increases, or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term net leases generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.



Diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy.  We believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant, industry, geography, and, to a certain extent, property type leads to more predictable investment results for our shareholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration.  Our investment efforts have led to a diversified property portfolio that, as of December 31, 2014 consisted of 4,327 properties located in 49 states and Puerto Rico, leased to 234 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 industry segments. Each of the 47 industry segments, represented in our property portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 10.0% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2014.  Since 1970, our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96%.  However we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to exceed 96%.



Investment Strategy

Our investment strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national tenants by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations. When identifying new properties for investment, we generally focus on acquiring the real estate tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business. We generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics:



·Properties that are freestanding, commercially-zoned with a single tenant;

·Properties that are in significant markets or strategic locations critical to generating revenue for regional and national tenants (i.e. they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business);

·Properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants and/or can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business;

·Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants, and have good visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares;

·Properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs;

·Properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents; and

·Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term, net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases.



We seek to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national tenants are capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale, strong consumer brands, advertising, and the selection of prime locations. In addition, we frequently acquire large portfolios of single-tenant properties net leased to different tenants in a variety of industries.  We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our relationships with various tenants, owners/developers, and advisers to uncover and secure transactions.  We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries, tenants, and property locations for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value.



-7-








In selecting potential investments, we look for tenants with the following attributes:



·Tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow;

·Tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources;

·Tenants that are willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and

·Tenants that are large owners and users of real estate.



From a retail perspective, our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price-point component to their business.  We believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers.  As a result of the execution of this strategy, over 90% of our retail rental is derived from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business.  From a non-retail perspective, we target industrial and distribution properties leased to Fortune 1000, primarily investment-grade-rated companies.  We believe rental revenue generated from businesses with these characteristics is generally more durable and stable.



After applying this investment strategy, we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable risk-adjusted return.



Underwriting Strategy

We believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers, and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue, we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive; and in the event of reorganization, they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers.



In order to be considered for acquisition, properties must meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit criteria. We have established a four-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:



·Industry, company, market conditions, and credit profile;

·Store profitability for retail locations, if profitability data is available;

·Overall real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative rental rates; and

·The importance of the real estate location to the operations of the tenants’ business.



Prior to entering into any transaction, our investment professionals, assisted by our research department, conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality.  The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization, and other financial metrics.  We conduct additional due diligence, including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates.  We continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed, and providing summaries of these findings to management.  We estimate that approximately 46% of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade companies or their subsidiaries.  At December 31, 2014, our top 20 tenants represent approximately 53% of our annualized revenue and nine of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings.



Asset Management Strategy

The active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing the credit quality of our portfolio.



-8-








We regularly review and analyze:



·The performance of the various industries of our tenants;

·The operation, management, business planning, and financial condition of our tenants; and

·The quality of the underlying real estate locations.



We have an active asset management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



·Generate higher returns;

·Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

·Extend our average remaining lease term; or

·Decrease tenant or industry concentration.



At December 31, 2014, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $14.8 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. In 2015, we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate approximately $50 million in property sales for all of 2015.  We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.



Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock, and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. However, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.



Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Table of Obligations,” which is presented in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs, and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our $1.5 billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings.



Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2014, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loan, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $4.93 billion, or approximately 30.6% of our total market capitalization of $16.11 billion.



We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2014 as the sum of:



·Shares of our common stock outstanding of 224,881,192, plus total common units of 816,568, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $47.71 per share on December 31, 2014, or $10.77 billion;

·Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25.00 per share) of the Class F preferred stock of $408.8 million;

·Outstanding borrowings of $223.0 million on our credit facility;

·Outstanding mortgages payable of $836.0 million, excluding net mortgage premiums of $16.6 million;

·Outstanding borrowings of $70.0 million on our term loan; and

·Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of $3.8 billion, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $14.6 million.

Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.



Universal Shelf Registration

In February 2013, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in February 2016. This replaces our prior shelf registration statement.  In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.



$1.5 Billion Acquisition Credit Facility

We have a $1.5 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility with an initial term that expires in May 2016 and includes, at our election, a one-year extension option. Under this credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling. We also have other interest rate options available to us under this credit facility. Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.



At December 31, 2014, we had a borrowing capacity of $1.28 billion available on our credit facility and an outstanding balance of $223.0 million.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, at December 31, 2014, was 1.2% per annum.  We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  At December 31, 2014, we remain in compliance with these covenants. We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We regularly review our credit facility and may seek to extend or replace our credit facility, to the extent we deem appropriate.



We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock, or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.



Cash Reserves

We are organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  At December 31, 2014, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $3.9 million.



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity are sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.  We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.



-10-








Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. We are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 with a “stable” outlook, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook to our senior notes, and Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook.



Based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% basis points over LIBOR.  The credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 1.85% if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) LIBOR plus 1.00% if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.45% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) 0.15% for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.



We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.



The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold our debt securities, preferred stock, or common stock.



Notes Outstanding

As of December 31, 2014, we had $3.8 billion of senior unsecured note and bond obligations, excluding unamortized original issuance discounts of $14.6 million.  All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. Interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.



Mortgage Debt

As of December 31, 2014, we had $836.0 million of mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions.  Additionally, at December 31, 2014, we had net premiums totaling $16.6 million on these mortgages.  We expect to pay off the mortgages as soon as prepayment penalties make it economically feasible to do so.  During 2014, we made $85.2 million in principal payments, including the repayment of six mortgages in full for $77.8 million.



Term Loan

In January 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in January 2018.  Borrowing under the term loan bears interest at LIBOR, plus 1.20%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 2.15%.



No Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts.



Corporate Responsibility

We are committed to providing an enjoyable, diverse, and safe working atmosphere for our employees, to upholding our responsibilities as a public company operating for the benefit of our shareholders, and to being mindful of the environment.  As The Monthly Dividend Company®, we believe our primary responsibility is to provide monthly dividends to our shareholders. How we manage and use the physical, human, and financial resources that enable us to acquire and own the real estate, which provides us with the lease revenue to pay monthly dividends, demonstrates our commitment to corporate responsibility.



Social Responsibility and Ethics.We are committed to being socially responsible and conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards. Our employees enjoy compensation that is in line with those of our peers and competitors, including generous healthcare benefits for employees and their families; participation in a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution by Realty Income; competitive paid time-off benefits; and an infant-at-work program for new parents.  Our employees also have access to members of our Board of Directors to report anonymously, if desired, any suspicion of misconduct by any member of our senior management or executive team.  We also have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity and adhere to all Equal Employer Opportunity Policy guidelines.



-11-








We apply the principles of full and fair disclosure in all of our business dealings, as outlined in our Corporate Code of Business Ethics. We are also committed to dealing fairly with all of our customers, suppliers, and competitors.



Corporate Governance.We believe that nothing is more important than a company’s reputation for integrity and serving as a responsible fiduciary for its shareholders. We are committed to managing the company for the benefit of our shareholders and are focused on maintaining good corporate governance.  Practices that illustrate this commitment include:



·Our Board of Directors is comprised of eight directors, seven of which are independent, non-employee directors;

·Our Board of Directors is elected on an annual basis;

·We employ a majority vote standard for elections;

·Our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors works with independent consultants, in conducting annual compensation reviews for our key executives, and compensates each individual based on primarily reaching certain performance metrics that determine the success of our company; and

·We adhere to all other corporate governance principles outlined in our “Corporate Governance Guidelines” document on our website.



Environmental Practices.Our focus on energy related matters is demonstrated by how we manage our day-to-day activities in our corporate headquarters.  In our headquarters, we promote energy conservation and encourage the following practices:



·Powering down office equipment at the end of the day;

·Setting copier machines to “energy saver mode;”

·Encouraging employees to reduce paper usage whenever possible, by storing documents electronically and using “duplex” copy mode;

·Employing an automated “lights out” system that is activated 24/7;

·Programming HVAC to only operate during normal business operating hours; and

·Encouraging employees to carpool to our headquarters.



In addition, our headquarters was constructed according to the State of California energy standards, specifically following California Green Building Standards Code and Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations, with features including high efficiency lighting and heating and cooling systems.



With respect to recycling and reuse practices, we encourage the use of recycled products and the recycling of materials during our operations.  Recycling bins are placed in all areas where materials are regularly disposed of and at the individual desks of our employees. Cell phones, wireless devices and office equipment are recycled or donated whenever possible.



With respect to the properties that we own, these properties are net-leased to our tenants who are responsible for maintaining the buildings and are in control of their energy usage and environmental sustainability practices.

Table of ContentsPROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATIONAt December 31, 2014, we owned a diversified portfolio:·Of 4,327 properties;·With an occupancy rate of 98.4%, or 4,257 properties leased and 70 properties available for lease;·Leased to 234 different commercial tenants doing business in 47 separate industries;·Located in 49 states and Puerto Rico;·With over 70.7 million square feet of leasable space; and·With an average leasable space per property of approximately 16,350 square feet, including approximately 11,290 square feet per retail property.At December 31, 2014, of our 4,327 properties, 4,257 were leased under net lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.At December 31, 2014, our 234 commercial tenants, which we define as retailers with over 50 locations and non-retailers with over $500 million in annual revenues, represented approximately 95% of our annualized revenue.  We had 267 additional tenants, representing approximately 5% of our annualized revenue at December 31, 2014, which brings our total tenant count to 501 tenants.-13-
