THE COMPANY



Realty
Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company®, is a
Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment
trust, or REIT. Our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly
cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from
operations, or FFO, per share.  Our monthly distributions are
supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of retail properties leased to
regional and national retail chains. We have in-house acquisition, leasing,
legal, credit research, real estate research, portfolio management and capital
markets expertise. Over the past 40 years, Realty Income and its predecessors
have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail properties that generate
rental revenue under long-term lease agreements (primarily 15 to 20
years).



In
addition, we seek to increase distributions to common stockholders and FFO per
share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional
properties. Our portfolio management focus includes:



●Contractual
      rent increases on existing leases;

●Rent
      increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions
      permit; and

●The
      active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant
      properties and selectively selling properties, thereby mitigating our
      exposure to certain tenants and
markets.



In
acquiring additional properties, we adhere to a focused strategy of primarily
acquiring properties that are:



●Freestanding,
      single-tenant, retail locations;

●Leased
      to regional and national retail chains;
and

●Leased
      under long-term, net-lease
agreements.



At
December 31, 2009, we owned a diversified portfolio:



●Of
      2,339 retail properties;

●With
      an occupancy rate of 96.8%, or 2,264 properties occupied and only 75
      properties available for lease;

●Leased
      to 118 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail
      industries;

●Located
      in 49 states;

●With
      over 19.1 million square feet of leasable space;
  and

●With
      an average leasable retail space per property of approximately 8,200
      square feet.



Of the
2,339 properties in the portfolio, 2,328, or 99.5%, are single-tenant, retail
properties and the remaining 11 are multi-tenant, distribution and office
properties. At December 31, 2009, of the 2,328 single-tenant properties, 2,254
were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding extension
options) of approximately 11.2 years.



In
addition, at December 31, 2009, our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest
Net Lease, Inc. ("Crest"), had an inventory of three properties valued at
$3.8 million, which are classified as held for sale. Crest was created to buy
and sell properties, primarily to individual investors who are involved in
tax-deferred exchanges under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the "Code"). In addition to the three properties, Crest also holds
notes receivable on properties previously sold of $22.2 million at

December
31, 2009.



We
typically acquire retail store properties under long-term leases with retail
chain store operators. These transactions generally provide capital to owners of
retail real estate and retail chains for expansion or other corporate purposes.
Our acquisition and investment activities are concentrated in well-defined
target markets and generally focus on retail chains providing goods and services
that satisfy basic consumer needs.

Our
net-lease agreements generally:



●Are
      for initial terms of 15 to 20
years;

●Require
      the tenant to pay minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses
      (taxes, insurance and maintenance);
and

●Provide
      for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index
      (typically subject to ceilings), fixed increases, or additional rent
      calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified
      level.



We
commenced operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25
public and private real estate limited partnerships. Each of the partnerships
was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and managing
long-term, net-leased properties.



The
seven senior officers of Realty Income owned 1.1% of our outstanding common
stock with a market value of $28.9 million at February 8, 2010. The
directors and seven senior officers of Realty Income, as a group, owned 1.3% of
our outstanding common stock with a market value of $35.6 million at
February 8, 2010.



Our
common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the ticker
symbol "O" with a cusip number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is
726728.



Our
Class D cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the
ticker symbol "OprD" with a cusip number of 756109-609.



Our
Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the
ticker symbol "OprE" with a cusip number of 756109-708.



In
February 2010, we had 72 employees as compared to 69 employees in February
2009.



We
maintain an Internet website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make
available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q, Form 3s, Form 4s, Form 5s, current reports on
Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably
practicable after we electronically file these reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, or SEC.  None of the information on our website
is deemed to be part of this report.





RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Increases
in Monthly Distributions to Common Stockholders

We have
continued our 40-year policy of paying distributions monthly. Monthly
distributions per share increased in January 2010 by $0.0003125 to $0.143. The
increase in January 2010 was our 49thconsecutive quarterly increase and the 56thincrease in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994. In
2009, we paid three monthly cash distributions per share in the amount of
$0.14175, three in the amount of $0.1420625, three in the amount of $0.142375
and three in the amount of $0.1426875, totaling $1.706625. In December 2009 and
January 2010, we declared distributions of $0.143 per share, which were paid in
January 2010 and will be paid in February 2010, respectively.



The
monthly distribution of $0.143 per share represents a current annualized
distribution of $1.716 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of
approximately 6.7% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on
the NYSE of $25.74 on February 8, 2010. Although we expect to continue our
policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will
maintain our current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern
of increasing distributions per share, or what our actual distribution yield
will be in any future period.





-3-


Acquisitions
During 2009

During
2009, we invested $57.9 million in 16 new properties with an initial weighted
average contractual lease rate of 9.7%. These 16 properties are located in five
states, contain over 278,000 leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an
average lease term of 17.9 years. The 16 new properties we acquired are
net-leased to four different retail chains. There were no acquisitions by Crest
in 2009.



We made
fewer portfolio acquisitions in 2008 and 2009 than in previous years because we
felt that preserving our capital resources and maintaining a high level of
liquidity until property prices adjusted and the general economy improved was
the prudent course of action. In late 2009, we felt that market conditions had
become more attractive for acquisitions, and we currently believe that there are
many retail chains, with solid operating concepts, that are in need of capital.
We believe that our solid financial position, strong balance sheet and access to
capital give us the ability to expand our acquisition activities in 2010 and
invest in new retail properties that have the potential to contribute to our
earnings.



The
initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated
contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property that is equal to the
aggregate base cash flow or, in the case of properties under development, the
estimated aggregate base cash flow under the lease) for the first year of each
lease, divided by the estimated total cost of the properties. Since it is
possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we
cannot assure you that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at
the percentages listed above.



Investments
in Existing Properties

In
2009, we capitalized costs of $3.1 million on existing properties in our
portfolio, consisting of $1.2 million for re-leasing costs and $1.9 million for
building improvements.



Net
Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net
income available to common stockholders was $106.9 million in 2009 versus
$107.6 million in 2008, a decrease of $714,000. On a diluted per common
share basis, net income was $1.03 per share in 2009 as compared to $1.06 per
share in 2008.



The
calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes
gains from the sale of properties. The amount of gains varies from period to
period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net
income available to common stockholders.



The
gain from the sale of properties during 2009 was $8.1 million, as compared to
$13.6 million during 2008.



Funds
from Operations (FFO)

In
2009, our FFO increased by $4.9 million, or 2.6%, to $190.4 million versus
$185.5 million in 2008.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO
was $1.84 in 2009 compared to $1.83 in 2008, an increase of $0.01, or
0.5%.



See our
discussion of FFO in the section entitled "Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this annual report, which
includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to
FFO.



Crest’s
Property Sales

During
2009, Crest sold two properties from its inventory for an aggregate of
$2.0 million, which resulted in no gain.



Crest’s
Property Inventory

Crest’s
had an inventory of three properties valued at $3.8 million at December 31,
2009, which is included in "real estate held for sale, net" on our consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2009.

Note
Redemption

Upon
their maturity in January 2009, we redeemed, using cash on hand, the $20 million
outstanding principal amount of our 8% Notes due 2009, or 2009 Notes. The 2009
Notes were redeemed at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount,
plus accrued and unpaid interest. We have no debt maturities until March
2013.



Retirement
of Board Members

William
E. Clark, our previous non-executive chairman, retired from the Board of
Directors in February 2009.Mr.
Clark had served as our Chairman of the Board since the inception of Realty
Income. Our Corporate Governance and Nominating Committee recommended, and the
Board of Directors elected, Donald R. Cameron as our new non-executive
chairman.



Roger
P. Kuppinger and Willard H Smith Jr retired from the Board of Directors in May
2009, at which time Ronald L. Merriman succeeded Mr. Kuppinger as chairman of
the Audit Committee.





DISTRIBUTION POLICY



Distributions
are paid monthly to our common, Class D preferred and Class E preferred
stockholders if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.



In
order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we
generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating
annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to
the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains), and we are
subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our REIT
taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2009, our cash distributions
totaled $202.3 million, or approximately 130.5% of our estimated REIT
taxable income of $155.0 million. Our estimated REIT taxable income
reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated
REIT taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT distribution
requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or performance.



We
intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient
to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce our exposure to
income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are more than
sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our
stockholders. Our 2009 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled
$178.0 million, representing 93.5% of our funds from operations available
to common stockholders of $190.4 million.



The
Class D preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of
7.375% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to
$1.84375 per annum per share). The Class E preferred stockholders receive
cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.75% per annum on the $25 per share
liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.6875 per annum per share). Dividends on
our Class D and Class E preferred stock are current.



Future
distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will
depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from
operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual
distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code, our debt
service requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem
relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that
could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a
deterioration in our results of operations or financial condition, and which
prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the
event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any
principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY



Capital
Philosophy

Historically,
we have met our long-term capital needs through the issuance of common stock,
preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we
believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure.
However, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to
time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a
level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested
into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to
permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt
securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the
capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.



Conservative
Capital Structure

We
believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital
structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our
balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December
31, 2009, our total outstanding credit facility borrowings and outstanding notes
were $1.355 billion, or approximately 30.8% of our total market
capitalization of $4.40 billion.



We
define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2009 as the sum
of:



●Shares
      of our common stock outstanding of 104,286,705 multiplied by the last
      reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $25.91 per share
      on December 31, 2009, or $2.70
billion;

●Aggregate
      liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class D preferred
      stock of $127.5 million;

●Aggregate
      liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class E preferred
      stock of $220 million;

●Outstanding
      notes of $1.35 billion; and

●Outstanding
      borrowings of $4.6 million on our credit
  facility.



Investment
Philosophy

We
believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of retail
properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable
income. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly
rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and
maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically responsible for future rent
increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to
ceilings), fixed increases or additional rent calculated as a percentage of the
tenants' gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of
properties under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant's responsibility for
property expenses, generally produces a more predictable income stream than many
other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential
for growth in rental income.

Investment
Strategy

When
identifying new properties for acquisition, our focus is generally on providing
capital to retail chain owners and operators by acquiring, then leasing back,
retail store locations. We categorize retail tenants as: 1) venture market,
2) middle market, and 3) upper market. Venture companies typically
offer a new retail concept in one geographic region of the country and operate
between five and 50 retail locations. Middle market retail chains typically have
50 to 500 retail locations, operations in more than one geographic region, have
been successful through one or more economic cycles, and have a proven,
replicable concept. The upper market retail chains typically consist of
companies with 500 or more locations, operating nationally, in a proven, mature
retail concept. Upper market retail chains generally have strong operating
histories and access to several sources of capital.



We
primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to middle market retail chains
that we believe are attractive for investment because:



●They
      generally have overcome many of the operational and managerial obstacles
      that can adversely affect venture
retailers;

●They
      typically require capital to fund expansion but have more limited
      financing options than upper market retail
  chains;

●They
      generally have provided us with attractive risk-adjusted returns over time
      since their financial strength has, in many cases, tended to improve as
      their businesses have matured;

●Their
      relatively large size allows them to spread corporate expenses across a
      greater number of stores; and

●Middle
      market retailers typically have the critical mass to survive if a number
      of locations are closed due to
underperformance.



Historically,
our investment focus has primarily been on retail industries that have a service
component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is
more stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December
31, 2009, approximately 84.3% of our rental revenue was derived from retailers
with a service component in their business. Furthermore, we believe these
service-oriented businesses would be difficult to duplicate over the Internet
and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from
Internet businesses.



Credit
Strategy

We
generally provide sale-leaseback financing to less than investment grade retail
chains. We typically acquire and lease back properties to regional and national
retail chains and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive
risk-adjusted return on the financing we provide to retailers. Since 1970, our
overall weighted average occupancy rate at the end of each year has been 98.3%,
and our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below
96%.



We
believe the principal financial obligations of most retailers typically include
their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate
lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a
tenant conducts its retail business, we believe the risk of default on a
retailers’ lease obligations is less than the retailers' unsecured general
obligations. It has been our experience that since retailers must retain their
profitable retail locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization
they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this
would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we
believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same retailer in the
event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during
reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or
sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real
estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the
retailers' individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations
that are weaker performers.





-7-


In
order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must
meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate
attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit
profile.  We have established a three-part analysis that examines each
potential investment based on:



●Industry,
      company, market conditions and credit
profile;

●Store
      profitability, if profitability data is available;
  and

●Overall
      real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative
      rental rates.



The
typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition
are those with 50 or more retail locations. Generally the
properties:



●Are
      located in highly visible areas;

●Have
      easy access to major thoroughfares;
and

●Have
      attractive demographics.



Acquisition
Strategy

We seek
to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national
retail chains are capturing market share through service, quality control,
economies of scale, advertising and the selection of prime retail locations. We
execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional
and national retail chain store owners and operators, doing business in a
variety of industries, by acquiring and leasing back retail store locations. We
undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be
appropriate industries, tenants and property locations for investment. Our
research expertise is fundamental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in
markets where our real estate financing program adds value. In selecting real
estate for potential investment, we generally seek to acquire properties that
have the following characteristics:



●Freestanding,
      commercially-zoned property with a single
  tenant;

●Properties
      that are important retail locations for regional and national retail
      chains;

●Properties
      that we deem to be profitable for the
retailers;

●Properties
      that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the
      business of our tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major
      thoroughfares; and

●Properties
      that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of
      long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the
      potential for rent increases.



Impact
of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the
commercial retail real estate market throughout 2008 and 2009, property prices
generally continued to decline and lease rates rose. Likewise, the U.S. credit
markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and
liquidity disruptions, which have impacted our access to and the cost of our
capital. We continue to monitor the commercial retail real estate and U.S.
credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our
business strategy accordingly. See Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in this
annual report.



Portfolio
Management Strategy

The
active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our
long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that
could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which
we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward
optimizing its returns and enhancing its credit quality. Our executives review
industry research, tenant research, property due diligence and significant
portfolio management activities. This monitoring typically includes regular
review and analysis of:



●The
      performance of various retail industries;
and

●The
      operation, management, business planning and financial condition of the
      tenants.





-8-


We have
an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when
we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



●generate
      higher returns;

●enhance
      the credit quality of our real estate
portfolio;

●extend
      our average remaining lease term;
or

●decrease
      tenant or industry concentration.



At
December 31, 2009, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of
$8.3 million as held for sale on our balance sheet, which includes three
properties owned by Crest, valued at $3.8 million. Additionally, we anticipate
selling investment properties in our portfolio that have not yet been
specifically identified, from which we anticipate receiving between $10 million
and $35 million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest these
proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities
available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the
next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any
properties in new properties.



Universal
Shelf Registration

In
March 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is
effective for a term of three years, to replace our prior shelf registration
statement which was set to expire in April 2009. Our new shelf
registration  statement expires in March 2012. In accordance with the
SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf
registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no
specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement
include common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or any combination of
these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in
amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are
offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds
of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus
supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any
offering.



$355
Million Acquisition Credit Facility

In May
2008, we entered into a $355 million revolving, unsecured credit facility which
replaced our previous $300 million acquisition credit facility. The term of our
credit facility is for three years, until May 2011, plus two, one-year extension
options. Under our credit facility, our investment grade credit ratings provide
for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as
LIBOR, plus 100 basis points with a facility fee of 27.5 basis points, for
all-in drawn pricing of 127.5 basis points over LIBOR. We also have other
interest rate options available to us. At December 31, 2009, we had a borrowing
capacity of $350.4 million available on our credit facility and an outstanding
balance of $4.6 million at an effective interest rate of 1.23%.



We
expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional retail properties and
for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our
exposure to interest rate risk. We have the right to request an increase in the
borrowing capacity of the credit facility, up to $100 million, to a total
borrowing capacity of $455 million.  Any increase in the borrowing
capacity is subject to approval by the banks participating in our credit
facility.



We
generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property
acquisitions. Thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we
generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term
or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock,
preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will
be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at
the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon
acceptable terms.



Credit
Agency Ratings

We are
currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior
unsecured notes. Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s Investors
Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group
has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes. All of these ratings have
"stable" outlooks.





-9-


We have
also been assigned credit ratings on our preferred stock. Fitch Ratings has
assigned a rating of BBB-, Moody’s has assigned a rating of Baa2 and Standard
& Poor’s has assigned a rating of BB+ to our preferred stock. All of these
ratings have "stable" outlooks.



The
credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our
results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to
ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our
ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in
its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation
to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common
stock.



Mortgage
Debt

We have
no mortgage debt on any of our properties.



No
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

We have
no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in "variable interest
entities" or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities
involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments.
Additionally, we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred
stock. As such, our financial position and results of operations are not
affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of off-balance
sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics
of both liabilities and equity.



Competitive
Strategy

We
believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we
must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages:



●Size and Type of Investment
      Properties:We believe smaller ($500,000 to $10,000,000) net-leased
      retail properties represent an attractive investment opportunity in
      today's real estate environment. Due to the complexities of acquiring and
      managing a large portfolio of relatively small assets, we believe these
      types of properties have not experienced significant institutional
      ownership interest or the corresponding yield reduction experienced by
      larger income-producing properties. We believe the less intensive
      day-to-day property management required by net-lease agreements, coupled
      with the active management of a large portfolio of smaller properties, is
      an effective investment strategy. The tenants of our freestanding retail
      properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic
      consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they generally need capital.
      Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest
      capital expenditure of many of these retailers, our method of purchasing
      the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease arrangement,
      allows the retail chain to free up
capital.



●Investment in New Retail
      Industries:We will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a
      variety of retail industries. We believe diversification will allow us to
      invest in retail industries that currently are growing and have
      characteristics we find attractive. These characteristics include, but are
      not limited to, retail industries that are dominated by local store
      operators where regional and national chain store operators can increase
      market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and
      streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing on major
      demographic shifts in a population
base.



●Diversification:Diversification of the portfolio by retail industry type, tenant, and
      geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable
      investment results for our stockholders, therefore further diversification
      of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December 31, 2009, our
      retail property portfolio consisted of 2,339 properties located in 49
      states, leased to 118 retail chains doing business in 30 industry
      segments. Each of the 30 industry segments, represented in our property
      portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 21.3% of our rental
      revenue for the quarter ended December 31,
2009.



●Management
      Specialization:We believe that our management's specialization in
      single-tenant retail properties, operated under net-lease agreements, is
      important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this
      specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality
      professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance
      and management.





-10-
●Technology:We intend
      to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to efficiently and
      economically carry out our operations. We maintain sophisticated
      information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio's performance
      and actively manage our investments. We believe that technology and
      information-based systems play an important role in our competitiveness as
      an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and
      tenants.





PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION



At
December 31, 2009, we owned a diversified portfolio:



●Of
      2,339 retail properties;

●With
      an occupancy rate of 96.8%, or 2,264 properties occupied and only 75
      properties available for lease;

●Leased
      to 118 different retail chains doing business in 30 separate retail
      industries;

●Located
      in 49 states;

●With
      over 19.1 million square feet of leasable space;
  and

●With
      an average leasable retail space per property of approximately 8,200
      square feet.



In
addition to our real estate portfolio, our subsidiary, Crest, had an inventory
of three properties located in three states at December 31, 2009. These
properties are valued at $3.8 million and are classified as held for
sale.



At
December 31, 2009, of our 2,339 retail properties, 2,254 were leased under
net-lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be
responsible for minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses including
property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are
typically responsible for future rent increases based on increases in the
consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), fixed increases or
additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a
specified level.



Our
net-leased retail properties primarily are leased to regional and national
retail chain store operators. Most buildings are single-story structures with
adequate parking on site to accommodate peak retail traffic periods. The
properties tend to be on major thoroughfares with relatively high traffic
counts, adequate access and proximity to a sufficient population base to
constitute a suitable market or trade area for the retailer's
business.



Our
net-lease agreements generally:



●Are
      for initial terms of 15 to 20
years;

●Require
      the tenant to pay minimum monthly rents and property operating expenses
      (taxes, insurance and maintenance);
and

●Provide
      for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index
      (typically subject to ceilings), fixed increases, or additional rent
      calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified
      level. Where leases provide for rent increases based on increases in the
      consumer price index, generally these increases become part of the new
      permanent base rent. Where leases provide for percentage rent, this
      additional rent is typically payable only if the tenants' gross sales, for
      a given period (usually one year), exceed a specified level and is then
      typically calculated as a percentage of only the amount of gross sales in
      excess of that level.
