THE COMPANY



Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company®, is a Maryland corporation organized to operate as an equity real estate investment trust, or REIT. Our primary business objective is to generate dependable monthly cash distributions from a consistent and predictable level of funds from operations, or FFO, per share.  Our monthly distributions are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises. We have in-house acquisition, leasing, legal, credit research, real estate research, portfolio management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 43 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding retail and other properties that generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements (primarily 10 to 20 years).



In addition, we seek to increase distributions to stockholders and FFO per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties.



Generally, our portfolio management efforts seek to achieve:



●Contractual rent increases on existing leases;

●Rent increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions permit; and

●The active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant properties, and selectively selling properties, thereby mitigating our exposure to certain tenants and markets.



In acquiring additional properties, our strategy is primarily to acquire properties that are:



●Freestanding, single-tenant locations;

●Leased to regional and national commercial enterprises; and

●Leased under long-term, net-lease agreements.



At December 31, 2011, we owned a diversified portfolio:



●Of 2,634 properties;

●With an occupancy rate of 96.7%, or 2,547 properties leased and only 87 properties available for lease;

●Leased to 136 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 38 separate industries;

●Located in 49 states;

●With over 27.3 million square feet of leasable space; and

●With an average leasable space per property of approximately 10,400 square feet.



Of the 2,634 properties in the portfolio, 2,619, or 99.4%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining 15 are multi-tenant properties. At December 31, 2011, of the 2,619 single-tenant properties, 2,533 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 11.3 years.



We typically acquire properties under long-term leases with regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises. Our acquisition and investment activities generally focus on businesses providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer and business needs.



In general, our net-lease agreements:



●Are for initial terms of 10 to 20 years;

●Require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses (taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

●Provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.

We commenced operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25 public and private real estate limited partnerships. Each of the partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and managing long-term, net-leased properties.



Our nine senior officers owned 1.0% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $47.2 million at January 31, 2012. Our directors and nine senior officers, as a group, owned 1.2% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $57.7 million at January 31, 2012.



Our common stock is listed on The New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, under the ticker symbol "O" with a cusip number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is 726728.



Our Class D cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprD" with a cusip number of 756109-609.



Our Class E cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "OprE" with a cusip number of 756109-708.



Our Class F cumulative redeemable preferred stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “OprF” with a cusip number of ­­­­­­756109-807.



In February 2012, we had 83 employees as compared to 79 employees in February 2011.



We maintain an Internet website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, Form 3s, Form 4s, Form 5s, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of this report.



RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Increases in Monthly Distributions to Common Stockholders

We continue our 43-year policy of paying distributions monthly. Monthly distributions per common share increased by $0.0003125 in April 2011 to $0.1445625, in July 2011 to $0.144875, in October 2011 to $0.1451875 and in January 2012 to $0.1455. The increase in January 2012 was our 57thconsecutive quarterly increase and the 64thincrease in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994. In 2011, we paid three monthly cash distributions per common share in the amount of $0.14425, three in the amount of $0.1445625, three in the amount of $0.144875 and three in the amount of $0.1451875, totaling $1.736625. In December 2011, January 2012 and February 2012, we declared distributions of $0.1455 per share, which were paid in January 2012 and will be paid in February 2012 and March 2012, respectively.



The current monthly distribution of $0.1455 per share represents an annualized distribution of $1.746 per share, and an annualized distribution yield of approximately 5.0% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $34.96 on December 31, 2011. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly distributions, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of distributions, that we will continue our pattern of increasing distributions per share, or what our actual distribution yield will be in any future period.



Acquisitions During 2011

During 2011, we invested $1.02 billion in 164 new properties, and properties under development, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.8%. The majority of the lease revenue from these properties will be generated from tenants that have investment grade ratings on their senior debt securities. These 164 new properties, and properties under development, are located in 26 states, contain over 6.2 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 13.4 years.



-3-
The initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or, in the case of a property under development, the estimated base rent) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated total cost of the properties. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.



Included in the $1.02 billion invested during 2011 are:



(1)The acquisition of 33 single-tenant retail, distribution, office and manufacturing properties for approximately $543.8 million, under long-term, net lease agreements.

(2)The acquisition of 60 properties operating in the restaurant - quick service industry for $41.9 million, under long-term, net lease agreements.

(3)The acquisition of six properties operating in the wholesale clubs industry for $156.1 million, under long-term, net lease agreements.

(4)The acquisition of 36 properties operating in the grocery store industry for $151.4 million under long-term, net lease agreements.

(5)The acquisition of nine properties operating in the health and fitness industry for $63.2 million, under long-term, net lease agreements.

(6)The remaining 20 properties acquired totaled approximately $59.8 million.



Portfolio Discussion



Leasing Results

At December 31, 2011, we had 87 properties available for lease out of 2,634 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 96.7% occupancy rate.  Since December 31, 2010, when we reported 84 properties available for lease and a 96.6% occupancy rate, we:



●Leased 37 properties;

●Sold 21 properties available for lease; and

●Have 61 new properties available for lease.



During 2011, 89 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants.  The rent on these leases was $9.6 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $10.4 million.  At December 31, 2011, our average annualized rental revenue per square foot was approximately $17.06.



Matters Pertaining To Certain Tenants

In January 2012, Friendly Ice Cream Corporation, or Friendly’s, one of our tenants, announced that it was emerging from voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (which they had filed for in October 2011). Pursuant to the bankruptcy proceedings, Friendly’s accepted 102 of their 121 leases with us.  Friendly’s rejected 19 leases with us, representing approximately $1.8 million of annualized rent, and received rent concessions and term reductions on some of their accepted leases with us. We estimate that we will recover approximately 80% of the $16.1 million of annualized rent that Friendly’s was paying the Company before the bankruptcy filing.



Additionally, in January 2012, Buffets Holding, Inc., or Buffets, another one of our tenants, filed for voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Buffets leases 86 properties from us that, as of December 31, 2011, represented approximately $18.2 million, or approximately 3.9% of our annualized rental revenue.  Buffets rejected the leases on seven of our 86 properties, representing approximately $1.8 million of annualized rent.  Additionally, we have reached a preliminary agreement (subject to bankruptcy court approval) with Buffets regarding rent concessions and term reductions on some of Buffets’ other leases with us. Overall, post-bankruptcy, we estimate that we will recover approximately 65% of the $18.2 million of annualized rent that Buffets was paying us before the bankruptcy filing.  Friendly’s and Buffets both operate casual dining restaurants.



For both Friendly’s and Buffets, any properties returned to us are immediately available for re-lease to other tenants. We believe that demand in the market for the rejected properties will allow us to find suitable replacement tenants within the next 18 months. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in finding replacement tenants for these properties within this timeframe, or at all, or that Friendly’s or Buffets will continue to pay rent for the remainder of the lease terms on their accepted leases.



-4-


In addition, we have recently concluded an analysis of our portfolio and have identified other tenants, whose leases represented approximately 2% to 3% of our total annualized rent as of December 31, 2011, that we believe may make similar bankruptcy filings in 2012. However, the foregoing percentages are estimates and are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties and the actual percentage of annualized rent represented by other tenants who make bankruptcy filings during 2012 may be different.



Investments in Existing Properties

In 2011, we capitalized costs of $4.2 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.7 million for re-leasing costs and $2.5 million for building and tenant improvements.  In 2010, we capitalized costs of $3.6 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.5 million for re-leasing costs and $2.1 million for building improvements.



As part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  Leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.



The majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  It is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  The amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, credit worthiness, and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.



Issuance of Preferred Stock

In February 2012, we issued 14.95 million shares of 6.625% Monthly Income Class F cumulative redeemable preferred stock, including 1.95 million shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their overallotment option.  The net proceeds of approximately $361.7 million from this issuance will be used to redeem the outstanding Class D preferred stock, repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility and for other general corporate purposes.  Beginning February 15, 2017, the Class F preferred shares are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share. The initial dividend of $0.1702257 per share will be paid on March 15, 2012, and will cover 37 days.  Thereafter, dividends of $0.1380208 per share will be paid monthly.



Redemption of Preferred Stock

In January 2012, we announced that we plan to redeem our outstanding Class D preferred stock on March 1, 2012.  We will redeem the Class D preferred stock at $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends.



Issuance of Common Stock

In September 2011, we issued 6,300,000 shares of common stock at a price of $34.00 per share.  After underwriting discounts and other offering costs of $10.6 million, the net proceeds of $203.6 million were used to repay borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, which were used to fund recent acquisitions.



In March 2011, we issued 8,625,000 shares of common stock at a price of $34.81 per share.  After underwriting discounts and offering costs of $14.6 million, the net proceeds of $285.6 million were used to fund property acquisitions.



Re-opening of Unsecured Bonds due 2035

In June 2011, we “re-opened” our 5.875% senior unsecured bonds due 2035, or the 2035 Bonds, and issued $150 million in aggregate principal amount of additional 2035 Bonds.  The public offering price for the additional 2035 Bonds was 94.578% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 6.318% per annum.  Those 2035 Bonds constituted an additional issuance of, and a single series with, the $100 million in aggregate principal amount of 2035 Bonds that we issued in March 2005.  The net proceeds of $140.1 million were used to fund property acquisitions.

-5-Table of contentsDividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan

In March 2011, we established a Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan, or The Plan, to provide our common shareholders, as well as new investors, with a convenient and economical method to purchase our common stock and/or reinvest their distributions.  The Plan authorizes up to 6,000,000 common shares to be issued.  Through December 31, 2011, we issued 59,605 shares and received net proceeds of approximately $1.9 million under The Plan.



Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $132.8 million in 2011 versus $106.5 million in 2010, an increase of $26.3 million. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was $1.05 in 2011, as compared to $1.01 in 2010.



The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess land. The amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.



The gain from the sale of properties and excess real estate during 2011 was $5.7 million, as compared to$8.7 million during 2010.



Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO)

In 2011, our FFO increased by $55.5 million, or 28.6%, to $249.4 million versus $193.9 million in 2010.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $1.98 in 2011, compared to $1.83 in 2010, an increase of $0.15, or 8.2%.



See our discussion of FFO (which is not a financial measure under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP), which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO, in the section entitled "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in this annual report.



Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO)

In 2011, our AFFO increased by $56.1 million, or 28.4%, to $253.4 million versus $197.3 million in 2010. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was $2.01 in 2011, compared to $1.86 in 2010, an increase of $0.15, or 8.1%.



See our discussion of AFFO (which is not a financial measure under U.S. GAAP), which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO, in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report.



DISTRIBUTION POLICY



Distributions are paid monthly to our common, Class D preferred and Class E preferred stockholders if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.



In order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2011, our cash distributions totaled $243.6 million, or approximately 127.7% of our estimated taxable income of $190.8 million. Our estimated REIT taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated REIT taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT distribution requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or performance.



We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this distribution requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. Our 2011 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $219.3 million, representing 87.9% of our funds from operations available to common stockholders of $249.4 million.



-6-


The Class D preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 7.375% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.84375 per annum per share). On January 31, 2012, we announced that the Class D preferred stock would be redeemed on March 1, 2012. The Class E preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.75% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.6875 per annum per share). The Class F preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.625% per annum on the $25 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.65625 per annum per share). The initial Class F preferred stock dividend will be paid on March 15, 2012. Dividends on our Class D and Class E preferred stock are current.



Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our debt service requirements and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.



Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute "qualified dividend income" subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for "qualified dividend income" has generally been reduced to 15% (until it “sunsets” or reverts to the provisions of prior law, which under current law will occur with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012). In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc., or Crest) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year).



Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders' basis in their stock. Distributions above that basis, generally, will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 20.6% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2011, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. We are unable to predict the portion of future distributions that may be classified as a return of capital.



BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY



Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. However, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.



Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Table of Obligations,” which is presented in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our $425 million credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings.



-7-


Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2011, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $2.06 billion, or approximately 29.1% of our total market capitalization of $7.06 billion.



We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2011 as the sum of:



●Shares of our common stock outstanding of 133,223,338 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $34.96 per share on December 31, 2011, or $4.66 billion;

●Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class D preferred stock of $127.5 million;

●Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25 per share) of the Class E preferred stock of $220 million;

●Outstanding mortgages payable of $67.8 million;

●Outstanding borrowings of $237.4 million on our credit facility; and

●Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of $1.75 billion.



Investment Philosophy

We believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases. We believe that owning a portfolio of properties under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant's responsibility for property expenses, generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.



Investment Strategy

When identifying new properties for acquisition, our focus is generally on providing capital to owners and operators of retail and other commercial enterprises by acquiring, then leasing back, the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business.



We primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to retail and other commercial enterprises based on the following guidelines:



●Tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow;

●Tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources;

●Large owners and users of real estate;

●Real estate that is critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue (i.e. they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business);

●Real estate and tenants that are willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and

●Property transactions where we can achieve an attractive spread over our cost of capital.



Historically, our investment focus has primarily been on retail and other commercial enterprises that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31, 2011, approximately 83% of our retail rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business. We believe these service-oriented businesses would generally be difficult to duplicate over the Internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from Internet-based businesses.



Credit Strategy

We typically acquire and lease properties to regional and national commercial enterprises and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return. Since 1970, our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96%.

-8-Table of contentsWe believe the principal financial obligations of most commercial enterprises typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business, we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligations is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable location because this would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on the real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants' individual unit locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers.



In order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile.  We have established a three-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:



●Industry, company, market conditions and credit profile;

●For retail locations, store profitability, if profitability data is available, and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the company’s business; and

●Overall real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative rental rates.



The typical profile of companies whose properties have been approved for acquisition are those with 50 or more locations. Generally the properties:



●Are located in highly visible areas;

●Have easy access to major thoroughfares; and

●Have attractive demographics.



Acquisition Strategy

We seek to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises are capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale, strong consumer brands, advertising, and the selection of prime locations. We execute our acquisition strategy by acting as a source of capital to regional and national commercial enterprises by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations. We undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries, tenants and property locations for investment. Our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value. In selecting potential investments, we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics:



●Properties that are freestanding, commercially-zoned with a single tenant;

●Properties that are important locations for regional and national commercial enterprises;

●Properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants and/or can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business;

●Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas, relative to the business of our tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares; and

●Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for rent increases.



Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continue to monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly. See Item 1A entitled "Risk Factors" in this annual report.

-9-Table of contentsPortfolio Management Strategy

The active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality.



Our executives regularly review and analyze:



●The performance of the various industries of our tenants; and

●The operation, management, business planning, and financial condition of our tenants.



We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



●Generate higher returns;

●Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

●Extend our average remaining lease term; or

●Decrease tenant or industry concentration.



At December 31, 2011, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $2.2 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. In 2012, we intend to employ more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio.  As a result, we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified, from which we anticipate receiving between $25 million and $60 million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months or be able to invest the proceeds from the sales of any properties in new properties.



Universal Shelf Registration

In March 2009, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which expires in March 2012. In accordance with the SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, or any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering. We plan to file a new shelf registration statement prior to the expiration of our existing shelf registration.



$425 Million Acquisition Credit Facility

We have a $425 million unsecured, revolving credit facility. The initial term of the credit facility expires in March 2014 and includes two, one-year extension options. Under the credit facility, the current investment grade credit ratings on our debt securities provide for financing at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR. The borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling.  We also have other interest rate options available to us under the credit facility.  Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation. At December 31, 2011, we had a borrowing capacity of $187.6 million available on our credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $237.4 million.  As a result of the issuance of our Class F preferred stock in February 2012, we paid off all outstanding credit facility borrowings on February 7, 2012.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our credit facility at December 31, 2011 was 2.1% per annum. We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility. At December 31, 2011, we remain in compliance with these covenants.



We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility, up to $200 million, to a total borrowing capacity of $625 million.  Any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility.

-10-Table of contentsWe generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.



Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings.  We are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+, Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB to our senior notes. All of these ratings have "stable" outlooks.



Based on our current ratings, the current facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 185 basis points with a facility commitment fee of 35 basis points, for all-in drawn pricing of 220 basis points over LIBOR.  The credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 300 basis points if our credit facility is lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) LIBOR plus 175 basis points if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.



In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which ranges from: (i) 50 basis points for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3, and (ii) 30 basis points for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.



We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.



The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.



Mortgage Debt

As of December 31, 2011, we have $67.2 million of mortgages payable to third-party lenders that were assumed in 2011, in connection with our property acquisitions.  We paid $279,000 in principal payments on these mortgages payable during 2011.  Additionally, net premiums totaling $820,000, in aggregate, were recorded upon assumption of the mortgages payable at the time of the respective property acquisitions to account for above-market interest rates.  We recorded amortization of $189,000 related to these net premiums during 2011.



Our mortgages payable are secured by the properties on which the debt was placed and are non-recourse.  We expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so.  We intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness.



No Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements or Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated or off-balance sheet investments in "variable interest entities" or off-balance sheet financing, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts or other derivative instruments. Additionally, we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. As such, our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the consolidation of off-balance sheet entities and classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.

-11-Table of contentsCompetitive Strategy

We believe that to successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we must seek to maintain the following competitive advantages:



●Type of Investment Properties:We believe net-leased properties, whether purchased individually or as part of larger portfolio purchases, represent an attractive investment opportunity in today's real estate environment. The less intensive day-to-day property management required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of properties, is an effective investment strategy. The tenants of our freestanding properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they generally need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these tenants, our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease arrangement, allows the commercial enterprise to free up capital.



●Investment in New Industries:We will seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive. When analyzing new industries, we seek to acquire properties that are critical to the success of a commercial enterprise, through its distribution of the product or service. Other characteristics may include, but are not limited to, industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national store operators and other commercial enterprises can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base.



●Diversification:Diversification of the portfolio by industry type, tenant, and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders, therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December 31, 2011, we owned a diversified property portfolio that consisted of 2,634 properties located in 49 states, leased to 136 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 38 industry segments. Each of the 38 industry segments, represented in our property portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 17.2% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2011.



●Management Specialization:We believe that our management's specialization in acquiring and managing single-tenant properties, operated under net-lease agreements, purchased individually or as part of a larger portfolio, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.



●Technology:We intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to carry out our operations efficiently and economically. We maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio's performance and actively manage our investments. We believe that technology and information-based systems play an important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants.

PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION



At December 31, 2011, we owned a diversified portfolio:



●Of 2,634 properties;

●With an occupancy rate of 96.7%, or 2,547 properties leased and only 87 properties available for lease;

●Leased to 136 different retail and other commercial enterprises doing business in 38 separate industries;

●Located in 49 states;

●With over 27.3 million square feet of leasable space; and

●With an average leasable space per property of approximately 10,400 square feet.



At December 31, 2011, of our 2,634 properties, 2,533 were leased under net-lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants' gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.



In order to more accurately reflect our exposure to various industries, the following industry table has been modified from similar tables we have prepared in the past to reflect the changes below:



●Properties previously included in the “distribution and office” industry were reclassified to the “home improvement,” “convenience store,” and “restaurant” industries, to better reflect the industry in which the tenant operates;

●The “restaurant” industry was separated into the “restaurants - casual dining” industry, which includes dinner houses and family restaurants, and the “restaurants - quick service” industry, which includes fast food restaurants;

●The “equipment rental” industry was renamed “equipment services;”

●The “travel plazas” industry was renamed “transportation services;” and

●The “wine and spirits” industry was renamed “beverages.”
