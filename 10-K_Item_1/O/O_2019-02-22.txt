THE COMPANY



Realty Income, The Monthly Dividend Company®, is an S&P 500 company dedicated to providing stockholders with dependable monthly dividends that increase over time.  The company is structured as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring it annually to distribute at least 90% of its taxable income (excluding net capital gains) in the form of dividends to its stockholders.  The monthly dividends are supported by the cash flow generated from real estate owned under long-term, net lease agreements with regional and national commercial tenants.



Realty Income was founded in 1969, and listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: O) in 1994.  Over the past 50 years, Realty Income has been acquiring and managing freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term net lease agreements.  The company is a member of the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats®index for having increased its dividend every year for more than 20 consecutive years.



AtDecember 31, 2018, we owned a diversified portfolio:

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 50-year policy of paying monthly dividends. In addition, we increased the dividend five times during 2018 and twice during 2019.  As of February 2019, we have paid 85 consecutive quarterly dividend increases and increased the dividend 100 times since our listing on the NYSE in 1994.

The dividends paid per share during 2018 totaled approximately $2.6305, as compared to approximately $2.5270 during 2017, an increase of $0.1035, or 4.1%.



The monthly dividend of $0.2255 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $2.706 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 4.3% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $63.04 on December 31, 2018. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.



Acquisitions During 2018

During2018, we invested$1.8 billionin764new properties and properties under development or expansion, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of6.4%. The764new properties and properties under development or expansion are located in39states, will contain approximately5.2 millionleasable square feet, and are 100% leased with a weighted average lease term of14.8 years. The tenants occupying the new properties operate in21industries and the property types are96.3%retail and3.7%industrial, based on rental revenue.  During2018, none of our real estate investments caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets atDecember 31, 2018.



The initial weighted average contractual lease rate for a property is generally computed as estimated contractual first year cash net operating income, which, in the case of a net leased property, is equal to the aggregate cash base rent for the first full year of each lease, divided by the total cost of the property.  Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.



In the case of a property under development or expansion, the contractual lease rate is generally fixed such that rent varies based on the actual total investment in order to provide a fixed rate of return.  When the lease does not provide for a fixed rate of return on a property under development or expansion, the initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as follows: estimated cash net operating income (determined by the lease) for the first full year of each lease, divided by our projected total investment in the property, including land, construction and capitalized interest costs. Of the$1.8 billionwe invested during2018,$80.3 millionwas invested in14properties under development or expansion with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of6.9%.  We may continue to pursue development or expansion opportunities under similar arrangements in the future.

Portfolio Discussion

Leasing Results

AtDecember 31, 2018, we had80properties available for lease out of5,797properties in our portfolio, which represents a98.6%occupancy rate based on the number of properties in our portfolio. Since December 31, 2017, when we reported83properties available for lease out of5,172and a98.4%occupancy rate, we:



•Had267lease expirations;

•Re-leased228properties; and

•Sold42vacant properties.



Of the228properties re-leased during2018,215properties were re-leased to existing tenants,threewere re-leased to new tenants without vacancy, andtenwere re-leased to new tenants after a period of vacancy.  The annual rent on these228leases was$46.15 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of$44.66 million, which represents a rent recapture rate of103.3%on the properties re-leased during2018.



As part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions to unrelated, third party real estate brokers consistent with the commercial real estate industry standard, and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions. We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.



AtDecember 31, 2018, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately$14.24per square foot on the5,717leased properties in our portfolio.  AtDecember 31, 2018, we classified17properties, with a carrying amount of$16.6 million, as held for sale on our balance sheet.  The expected sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and is consistent with our existing disposition strategy to further enhance our real estate portfolio and maximize portfolio returns.



Investments in Existing Properties

In2018, we capitalized costs of$17.9 millionon existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of$3.9 millionfor re-leasing costs,$1.1 millionfor recurring capital expenditures, and$12.9 millionfor non-recurring building improvements. In 2017, we capitalized costs of$12.7 millionon existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of$1.6 millionfor re-leasing costs,$912,000for recurring capital expenditures, and$10.2 millionfor non-recurring building improvements.



The majority of our building improvements relate to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements. The amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, the lease term and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.



We define recurring capital expenditures as mandatory and repetitive landlord capital expenditure obligations that have a limited useful life. We define non-recurring capital expenditures as property improvements where we invest additional capital that extend the useful life of the properties.



Sumit Roy Appointed Chief Executive Officer (CEO)

On October 16, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors had appointed Sumit Roy to the position of our CEO and to our Board of Directors. Mr. Roy, who previously served as Chief Operating Officer, succeeds John P. Case, our previous CEO. Mr. Roy continues to serve as our President.



Tau Operating Partnership Buyout and Term Loan Payoff

In January 2019, we redeemed all of the outstanding 317,022 common units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P., which reduced our total common units outstanding to 373,797 as of January 3, 2019. Additionally, in January 2019, we paid off the outstanding balance and interest on the $70.0 million senior unsecured term loan entered in January 2013 in conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT. Following the redemption, we hold 100% of the ownership interests of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P., and continue to consolidate the entity.



New, Expanded Credit Facility

In October 2018, we entered into a new $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility to replace our previous $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility, of which $2.0 billion was due to expire in June 2019. This new credit facility includes a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a new $250.0 million unsecured term loan due March 2024. The new revolving credit facility matures in March 2023 and includes two six-month extensions that can be exercised at our



-4-






option. The new revolving credit facility, or our revolving credit facility, also has a $1.0 billion expansion feature. As ofDecember 31, 2018, we had a balance of$252.0 millionon our credit facility. Under our revolving credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at LIBOR plus 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.90% over LIBOR. Our previous $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility had all-in drawn pricing of 0.975% over LIBOR.



In conjunction with our new revolving credit facility, we entered into a new $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in March 2024.  Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one-month LIBOR plus 0.85%. In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest on this term loan at 3.89%.



S&P Upgrade to A-

In August 2018, S&P Global Ratings raised our credit rating to A- with a "stable" outlook from BBB+ with a "positive" outlook.



Note Issuance

In April 2018, we issued$500.0 millionof3.875%senior unsecured notes due 2025, or the 2025 Notes. The public offering price for the 2025 Notes was99.50%of the principal amount, for an effective yield to maturity of3.957%. The net proceeds of approximately$493.1 millionfrom this offering were used to repay borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, to fund investment opportunities, and for other general corporate purposes.



Capital Raising

During2018, we raised$1.1 billionfrom the sale of common stock, primarily through the use of our at-the-market (ATM) programs, at a weighted average price of$58.77per share.



Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was$363.6 millionin2018, as compared to $301.5 million in 2017, an increase of$62.1 million. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was$1.26in2018, as compared to $1.10 in 2017, an increase of$0.16, or14.5%.



Net income available to common stockholders in 2018 was impacted by a severance payment made to our former CEO in October 2018.  The total value of cash, stock compensation and professional fees incurred as a result of this severance was $28.3 million; however, the net amount, after incorporating accruals for CEO compensation previous to this severance, was $18.7 million, equivalent to $0.06 per share.



Net income and funds from operations available to common stockholders per share in 2017 were impacted by a loss of $42.4 million, or $0.15 per share, on extinguishment of debt upon the early redemption on all $550.0 million of our outstanding 6.75% notes due August 2019 during December 2017. Net income and funds from operations available to common stockholders for 2017 were also impacted by a $13.4 million non-cash redemption charge on the shares of Class F preferred stock that were redeemed in April 2017, which represented $0.05 on a diluted per common share basis. This charge was based on the excess of redemption value over the carrying value of the Class F preferred stock that represents the original issuance cost that was paid in 2012.



The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes impairments and gains from the sale of properties, which can vary from period to period based on the timing and significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.



Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO)

In2018, our FFO increased by$130.6 million, or16.9%, to$903.3 million, as compared to$772.7 millionin 2017.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was$3.12in2018, as compared to$2.82in 2017, an increase of$0.30, or10.6%.



Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO)

In2018, our AFFO increased by$86.0 million, or10.3%, to$924.6 million, as compared to$838.6 millionin 2017. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was$3.19in2018, as compared to$3.06in 2017, an increase of$0.13, or4.2%.



See our discussion of FFO and AFFO (which are not financial measures under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP), later in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition

and Results of Operations,” in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and AFFO.





DIVIDEND POLICY



Distributions are paid monthly to holders of shares of our common stock.



Distributions are paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Realty Income, L.P., each on a per unit basis that is generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders.  Prior to the redemption of our common units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P. in January 2019, distributions were paid monthly to the limited partners holding common units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P., each on a per unit basis that was generally equal to the amount paid per share to our common stockholders.



In order to maintain our status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2018, our cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $761.6 million, or approximately 133.5% of our estimated taxable income of $570.4 million. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance.  We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. Our cash distributions to common stockholders in 2018 totaled $761.6 million, representing 82.4% of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of$924.6 million. In comparison, our 2017 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled$689.3 million, representing 82.2% of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of$838.6 million.



Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, our debt service requirements, and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions payable by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.



Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20%. In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiaries) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year). However, non-corporate stockholders, including individuals, generally may deduct up to 20% of dividends from a REIT, other than capital gain dividends and dividends treated as qualified dividend income, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026.



Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will first be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis generally will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 22.9% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2018, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. We estimate that in 2019, between 15% and 25% of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY



We believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of primarily single-tenant commercial properties under long-term, net lease agreements produces consistent and predictable income. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. In addition, tenants of our properties typically pay rent increases based on: (1) increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), (2) fixed increases, or (3) additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term, net lease agreements generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.



Diversification is also a key component of our investment philosophy.  We believe that diversification of the portfolio by tenant, industry, geography, and, to a certain extent, property type leads to more consistent and predictable income for our stockholders by reducing vulnerability that can come with any single concentration.  Our investment activities have led to a diversified property portfolio that, as of December 31, 2018, consisted of5,797properties located in49states and Puerto Rico, leased to262different commercial tenants doing business in48industries. Each of the 48 industries represented in our property portfolio accounted for no more than12.4%of our rental revenue during either the quarter or year endedDecember 31, 2018.



Investment Strategy

When identifying new properties for investment, we generally focus on acquiring high-quality real estate that tenants consider important to the successful operation of their business. We generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics:



•Properties that are freestanding, commercially-zoned with a single tenant;

•Properties that are in significant markets or strategic locations critical to generating revenue for our tenants (i.e. they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business);

•Properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants and/or can generally be characterized as important to the successful operations of the company’s business;

•Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas relative to the business of our tenants, generally fungible, and have good visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares;

•Properties with real estate valuations that approximate replacement costs;

•Properties with rental or lease payments that approximate market rents; and

•Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term, net lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for future rent increases.



We seek to invest in industries in which several well-organized tenants are capturing market share through the selection of prime real estate locations supported by superior service, quality control, economies of scale, consumer branding, and advertising. In addition, we frequently acquire large portfolios of single-tenant properties net leased to different tenants operating in a variety of industries.  We have an internal team dedicated to sourcing such opportunities, often using our relationships with various tenants, owners/developers, brokers and advisers to uncover and secure transactions.  We also undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate property locations, tenants, and industries for investment. This research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net lease opportunities in markets where we believe we can add value.



In selecting potential investments, we look for tenants with the following attributes:



•Tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow;

•Tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources;

•Tenants that are willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and

•Tenants that are large owners and users of real estate.



From a retail perspective, our investment strategy is to target tenants that have a service, non-discretionary, and/or low-price-point component to their business.  We believe these characteristics better position tenants to operate in a variety of economic conditions and to compete more effectively with internet retailers.  As a result of the execution of this strategy, approximately 95% of our annualized retail rental revenue at December 31, 2018 is derived from tenants with a service, non-discretionary, and/or low price point component to their business.  From a non-retail perspective, we target industrial properties leased to industry leaders that are primarily investment grade rated



-7-






companies.  We believe these characteristics enhance the stability of the rental revenue generated from these properties.



After applying this investment strategy, we pursue those transactions where we can achieve an attractive investment spread over our cost of capital and favorable risk-adjusted returns. We will continue to evaluate all investments consistent with our objective of owning net lease assets.



Underwriting Strategy

In order to be considered for acquisition, properties must meet stringent underwriting requirements. We have established a four-part analysis to examine each potential investment based on:



•The aforementioned overall real estate characteristics, including demographics, replacement cost and comparative rental rates;

•Industry, tenant (including credit profile), and market conditions;

•Store profitability for retail locations if profitability data is available; and

•The importance of the real estate location to the operations of the tenants’ business.



We believe the principal financial obligations for most of our tenants typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers, and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue, we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligation is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive. Therefore, in the event of reorganization, they are less likely to reject a lease of a profitable or critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property.



Thus, as the property owner, we believe that we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to proactively sell locations that meet our criteria for disposition.



Prior to entering into any transaction, our research department conducts a review of a tenant’s credit quality.  The information reviewed may include reports and filings, including any public credit ratings, financial statements, debt and equity analyst reports, and reviews of corporate credit spreads, stock prices, market capitalization, and other financial metrics.  We conduct additional due diligence, including additional financial reviews of the tenant and a more comprehensive review of the business segment and industry in which the tenant operates.  We continue to monitor our tenants’ credit quality on an ongoing basis by reviewing the available information previously discussed, and providing summaries of these findings to management.  Approximately51%of our annualized rental revenue comes from properties leased to investment grade rated companies or their subsidiaries.  AtDecember 31, 2018, our top 20 tenants represented approximately54%of our annualized revenue and12of these tenants have investment grade credit ratings or are subsidiaries of investment grade companies.



Portfolio and Asset Management Strategy

In addition to pursuing new properties for investment, we seek to increase earnings and distributions to stockholders through active portfolio and asset management.



Generally, our portfolio and asset management efforts seek to achieve:



•Rent increases at the expiration of existing leases, when market conditions permit;

•Optimum exposure to certain tenants, industries, and markets through re-leasing vacant properties and selectively selling properties;

•Maximum asset-level returns on properties that are re-leased or sold;

•Additional value creation from the existing portfolio by enhancing individual properties, pursuing alternative uses, and deriving ancillary revenue; and

•Investment opportunities in new asset classes for the portfolio.



We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of our tenants, our tenants’ industries, and the real estate locations in which we have invested.  We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a



-8-






view towards optimizing its returns and enhancing its overall credit quality.  Our active portfolio and asset management strategy pursues asset sales when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



•Generate higher returns;

•Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

•Extend our average remaining lease term; and/or

•Strategically decrease tenant, industry, or geographic concentration.



AtDecember 31, 2018, we classified17properties with a carrying amount of$16.6 millionas held for sale on our balance sheet. For 2019, we intend to continue our active disposition efforts to further enhance our real estate portfolio and anticipate $75 to $100 million in property sales. We plan to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during 2019 at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.



The active management of the portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy of maintaining high occupancy. Since 1970, our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96%. However, we cannot assure you that our future occupancy levels will continue to equal or exceed 96%.



Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure; however, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were initially financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at all times and at terms that are acceptable to us.



Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Table of Obligations,” which is presented later in this section. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, property sales, borrowing on our credit facility and periodically through public securities offerings.



Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. AtDecember 31, 2018, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes and bonds, term loans, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were$6.5 billion, or approximately25.4%of our total market capitalization of$25.7 billion.



We define our total market capitalization atDecember 31, 2018as the sum of:



•Shares of our common stock outstanding of303,742,090, plus total common units outstanding of690,819, multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of$63.04per share onDecember 31, 2018, or$19.2 billion;

•Outstanding borrowings of$252.0 millionon our credit facility;

•Outstanding mortgages payable of$298.4 million, excluding net mortgage premiums of$4.4 millionand deferred financing costs of$183,000;

•Outstanding borrowings of$570.0 millionon our term loans, excluding deferred financing costs of$1.4 million; and

•Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of$5.4 billion, excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of$10.5 millionand deferred financing costs of$33.7 million.



In January 2019, we redeemed all of our outstanding 317,022 common units of Tau Operating Partnership, L.P., which reduced our total common units outstanding to 373,797 as of January 3, 2019.

Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations, and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.



Universal Shelf Registration

In November 2018, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in November 2021. In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit. The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities. We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if these securities are offered. The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.



Revolving Credit Facility

In October 2018, we entered into a new $3.25 billion unsecured credit facility to replace our previous $2.25 billion unsecured credit facility, of which $2.0 billion was due to expire in June 2019. This new credit facility includes a $3.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility and a new $250.0 million unsecured term loan due March 2024. The new revolving credit facility, or our revolving credit facility, matures in March 2023 and includes two six-month extensions that can be exercised at our option. Our revolving credit facility also has a $1.0 billion expansion feature. Under our new revolving credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at LIBOR plus 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.90% over LIBOR.



The borrowing rate under our revolving credit facility is subject to an interest rate floor and may change if our investment grade credit ratings change. We also have other interest rate options available to us under our credit facility. Our revolving credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.



AtDecember 31, 2018, we had a borrowing capacity of$2.75 billionavailable on our revolving credit facility and an outstanding balance of$252.0 million. The weighted average interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility, atDecember 31, 2018, was3.2%per annum.  We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  AtDecember 31, 2018, we were in compliance with these covenants. We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other general corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk.



We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities at acceptable terms.



Cash Reserves

We are organized to operate as an equity REIT that acquires and leases properties and distributes to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash distributions, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  AtDecember 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling$10.4 million.



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the next twelve months.  We intend, however, to use permanent or long-term capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.



Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our ratings assigned by credit rating agencies. As ofDecember 31, 2018, we were assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds:  Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of A3 with a “stable” outlook,



-10-






Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of A- with a “stable” outlook, and Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook.



Based on our ratings as ofDecember 31, 2018, the facility interest rate was LIBOR, plus 0.775% with a facility commitment fee of 0.125%, for all-in drawn pricing of 0.90% over LIBOR.  Our credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR, plus 1.45% if our credit rating is lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated and (ii) LIBOR, plus 0.75% if our credit rating is A/A2 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.30% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3 or unrated, and (ii) 0.10% for a credit rating of A/A2 or higher.



We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates charged in those transactions.  If our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease. The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.



Term Loans

In October 2018, in conjunction with our revolving credit facility, we entered into a new $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in March 2024. Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one-month LIBOR plus 0.85%. In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest on this term loan at 3.89%.



In December 2017, in conjunction with the acquisition of a portfolio of properties, we entered into a $125.9 million promissory note, which was paid in full at maturity in January 2018. Borrowings under this note bore interest at 1.52%.



In June 2015, in conjunction with entering into our previous credit facility, we entered into a $250.0 million senior unsecured term loan maturing on June 30, 2020.  Borrowing under this term loan bears interest at the current one-month LIBOR, plus 0.90%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap which effectively fixes our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.62%.



In January 2013, in conjunction with our acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., or ARCT, we entered into a $70.0 million senior unsecured term loan with an initial maturity date of January 2018.  Borrowing under this term loan bore interest at the current one-month LIBOR plus 1.10%. In conjunction with this term loan, we also entered into an interest rate swap, which, until its termination in January 2018, effectively fixed our per annum interest rate on this term loan at 2.05%.  In 2018, we entered into two separate six–month extensions of this loan, during which periods the interest was born at the current one–month LIBOR, plus 0.90%. In January 2019, we paid off the outstanding principal and interest on this term loan.



Mortgage Debt

As ofDecember 31, 2018, we had$298.4 millionof mortgages payable, all of which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions. Additionally, atDecember 31, 2018, we had net premiums totaling$4.4 millionon these mortgages and deferred financing costs of$183,000.  We expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties have declined to a level that would make it economically feasible to do so.  During 2018, we made$21.9 millionof principal payments, including the repayment oftwomortgages in full for$17.0 million.



Notes Outstanding

As ofDecember 31, 2018, we had$5.4 billionof senior unsecured note and bond obligations, excluding unamortized net original issuance premiums of$10.5 millionand deferred financing costs of$33.7 million.  All of our outstanding notes and bonds have fixed interest rates. Interest on all of our senior note and bond obligations is paid semiannually.



No Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts.

Corporate Responsibility

Realty Income is committed to conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards. We are dedicated to providing an engaging, diverse, and safe work environment for our employees, operating our business in an environmentally conscious manner, and upholding our corporate responsibilities as a public company for the benefit of our shareholders. As The Monthly Dividend Company®, our mission is to provide our stockholders with monthly dividends that increase over time. How we manage and use the physical, financial and talent resources that enable us to achieve this mission, demonstrates our commitment to corporate responsibility.



Environmental Practices

Our focus on the environment is demonstrated by how we manage our day-to-day activities at our corporate headquarters. At our headquarters, we promote energy efficiency and encourage practices such as:



•Powering down office equipment at the end of the day;

•Implementing file-sharing technology and automatic “duplex mode” to limit paper use;

•Adopting electronic approval systems;

•Encouraging employees to carpool to our headquarters; and

•Recycling paper waste.



With respect to recycling and reuse practices, we encourage the use of recycled products and the recycling of materials used in our operations. Cell phones, wireless devices and office equipment are recycled or donated whenever possible. In 2018, we sent more than 28,500 pounds of paper to our offsite partner for recycling.



In addition, our headquarters was constructed according to the State of California energy efficiency standards (specifically following California Green Building Standards Code and Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations), with features such as an automatic lighting control system with light-harvesting technology, a building management system that monitors and controls energy use, an energy-efficient PVC roof and heating and cooling system, and drought-tolerant landscaping with recycled materials. We continue to evaluate our current operations, strive to improve our environmental performance, and implement sustainable business practices.



The properties in our portfolio are primarily net leased to our tenants who are responsible for maintaining the buildings and are in control of their energy usage and environmental sustainability practices. We work with our tenants to promote environmental responsibility at the properties we own, with some locations achieving LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification.



Our Asset Management team has engaged with a renewable energy development company to identify assets that would maximize energy efficiency initiatives throughout our property portfolio. These initiatives include solar energy arrays, battery storage, and charging stations. In addition, we continue to explore regional opportunities with our tenants in order to qualify for city and county renewable energy or energy efficiency programs to conserve our world’s finite resources.



Realty Income also has an internal "Green Team" that encourages our employees to focus on environmentally-smart choices to further reduce our environmental impact as a company. The Green Team, which includes executive and officer-level employees, works to positively impact the environment through education and engagement within the company and local communities, focusing on waste, energy, and water management.



Company Culture and Employees

We put great effort into cultivating an inclusive company culture. We are one team, and together we are committed to a culture that provides an engaging work environment and encourages respect, collaboration, humility, transparency, and integrity. Regular open communication is central to how we work, and our employees take pride in our 50-year history of providing monthly dividends to our stockholders. We hire talented employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives, and work to provide an environment where capable team members have fulfilling careers in the real estate industry.



Social Responsibility

We are committed to providing a positive and engaging work environment for our employees and taking an active role in the betterment of the communities in which our employees and shareholders live and work. Our employees are awarded compensation that is in line with those of our peers and competitors, including generous healthcare benefits (medical, dental, vision) for all employees and their families, participation in a 401(k) plan with a matching contribution from Realty Income, restricted stock awards based on company performance, competitive paid time-off

benefits, a well-being program, continued education and development opportunities, up to 16 weeks of paid parental leave, and an infant-at-work program for new parents. We also have a long-standing commitment to being an equal opportunity employer and adhere to all Equal Employer Opportunity Policy guidelines.



We believe that giving back to our community is an extension of our mission to improve the lives of our shareholders, our employees, and their families. Realty Income and its employees have taken an active role in supporting communities through civic involvement with non-profit organizations and corporate donations. Our non-profit activities resulted in approximately 810 company-sponsored employee volunteer hours in 2018, principally through our partnership with San Diego Habitat for Humanity. We are proud of the efforts we have made to date and look forward to continuing to strengthen our impact as part of the successful operations of The Monthly Dividend Company®.



Additional information on Realty Income’s commitment to social responsibility may be found on our website.



Corporate Governance

We believe that nothing is more important than a company’s reputation for integrity and serving as a responsible fiduciary for its shareholders. We are committed to managing the company for the benefit of our stockholders and are focused on maintaining good corporate governance. Practices that illustrate this commitment include, but are not limited to:



•Our Board of Directors is currently comprised of ten directors, nine of whom are independent, non-employee directors;

•In accordance with our continued focus on board refreshment, in July 2018, we added two new independent, non-employee directors;

•Our Board of Directors is elected on an annual basis with a majority vote standard;

•Our directors conduct annual self-evaluations and participate in orientation and continuing education programs;

•An Enterprise Risk Management evaluation is conducted annually to identify and assess company risk;

•Each committee within our Board of Directors is comprised entirely of independent directors; and

•We adhere to all other corporate governance principles outlined in our Corporate Governance Guidelines. These guidelines, as well as our bylaws, committee charters and other governance documents may be found on our website.



Business Ethics

We are committed to conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards and upholding our corporate responsibilities as a public company operating for the benefit of our shareholders. Our Board of Directors has adopted a Code of Business Ethics that applies to our directors, officers, and other employees. The Code of Business Ethics includes our commitment to dealing fairly with all of our customers, service providers, suppliers, and competitors. We conduct an annual training with our employees regarding ethical behavior and require all employees to acknowledge the terms of, and abide by, our Code of Business Ethics, which is also available on our website. Our employees have access to members of our Board of Directors to report anonymously, if desired, any suspicion of misconduct by any member of our senior management or executive team.
