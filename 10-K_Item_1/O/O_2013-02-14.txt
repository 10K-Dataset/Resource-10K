Item 1:Business

THE COMPANY



Realty Income Corporation, The Monthly Dividend Company®, or Realty Income, is a publicly traded real estate company with the primary business objective of generating dependable monthly cash dividends from a consistent and predictable level of cash flow from operations. Our monthly distributions or dividends are supported by the cash flow from our portfolio of properties leased to commercial enterprises. We have in-house acquisition, leasing, legal, credit research, real estate research, portfolio management and capital markets expertise. Over the past 44 years, Realty Income and its predecessors have been acquiring and owning freestanding commercial properties that generate rental revenue under long-term lease agreements.



In 1994, Realty Income was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, and we elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, requiring us to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains).



We seek to increase distributions to stockholders and funds from operations, or FFO, per share through both active portfolio management and the acquisition of additional properties.



Generally, our portfolio management efforts seek to achieve:



·Contractual rent increases on existing leases;

·Rent increases at the termination of existing leases, when market conditions permit; and

·The active management of our property portfolio, including re-leasing vacant properties, and selectively selling properties, thereby mitigating our exposure to certain tenants and markets.



In acquiring additional properties, our strategy is primarily to acquire properties that are:



·Freestanding, single-tenant locations;

·Leased to regional and national commercial enterprises; and

·Leased under long-term, net-lease agreements.



At December 31, 2012, we owned a diversified portfolio:



·Of 3,013 properties;

·With an occupancy rate of 97.2%, or 2,929 properties leased and only 84 properties available for lease;

·Leased to 150 different commercial enterprises doing business in 44 separate industries;

·Located in 49 states;

·With over 37.6 million square feet of leasable space; and

·With an average leasable space per property of approximately 12,500 square feet.



Of the 3,013 properties in the portfolio, 2,996, or 99.4%, are single-tenant properties, and the remaining 17 are multi-tenant properties. At December 31, 2012, of the 2,996 single-tenant properties, 2,913 were leased with a weighted average remaining lease term (excluding rights to extend a lease at the option of the tenant) of approximately 11.0 years.



We typically acquire properties under long-term leases with regional and national retailers and other commercial enterprises. Our acquisition and investment activities generally focus on businesses providing goods and services that satisfy basic consumer and business needs.  In general, our net-lease agreements:



·Are for initial terms of 10 to 20 years;

·Require the tenant to pay minimum monthly rent and property operating expenses (taxes, insurance and maintenance); and

·Provide for future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.

We commenced operations as a REIT on August 15, 1994 through the merger of 25 public and private real estate limited partnerships. Each of the partnerships was formed between 1970 and 1989 for the purpose of acquiring and managing long-term, net-leased properties.



Our ten senior officers owned 0.7% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $56.3 million at February 1, 2013. Our directors and ten senior officers, as a group, owned 0.9% of our outstanding common stock with a market value of $67.0 million at February 1, 2013.



Our common stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “O” with a cusip number of 756109-104. Our central index key number is 726728.



Our 6.75% Monthly Income Class E Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “OprE” with a cusip number of 756109-708.



Our 6.625% Monthly Income Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock is listed on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “OprF” with a cusip number of 756109-807.



In February 2013, we had 97 employees as compared to 83 employees in February 2012.



We maintain a corporate website at www.realtyincome.com. On our website we make available, free of charge, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, Form 3s, Form 4s, Form 5s, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file these reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC.  None of the information on our website is deemed to be part of this report.



RECENT DEVELOPMENTS



Increases in Monthly Dividends to Common Stockholders

We have continued our 44-year policy of paying monthly dividends. Monthly dividends per common share increased by $0.0003125 in April 2012 to $0.1458125, increased by $0.0003125 in July 2012 to $0.146125, increased by $0.005 in September 2012 to $0.151125, increased by $0.0003125 in October 2012 to $0.1514375, increased by $0.0003125 in January 2013 to $0.15175, and increased by $0.0291667 in February 2013 to $0.1809167. The increase in January 2013 was our 61stconsecutive quarterly increase and the increase in February 2013 was our 70thincrease in the amount of our dividend since our listing on the NYSE in 1994. In 2012, we paid three monthly cash dividends per common share in the amount of $0.1455, three in the amount of $0.1458125, two in the amount of $0.146125, one in the amount of $0.151125, and three in the amount of $0.1514375, totaling $1.771625. In December 2012, we declared dividends of $0.15175 per share, which were paid in January 2013.  In January 2013 and February 2013, we declared dividends of $0.1809167 per share, which will be paid in February 2013 and March 2013, respectively.



The monthly dividend of $0.1809167 per share represents a current annualized dividend of $2.171 per share, and an annualized dividend yield of approximately 5.0% based on the last reported sale price of our common stock on the NYSE of $43.40 on February 1, 2013. Although we expect to continue our policy of paying monthly dividends, we cannot guarantee that we will maintain our current level of dividends, that we will continue our pattern of increasing dividends per share, or what our actual dividend yield will be in any future period.



Acquisitions During 2012

During 2012, Realty Income invested $1.16 billion in real estate, acquiring 423 properties, and properties under development, with an initial weighted average contractual lease rate of 7.2%.  The majority of the lease revenue from these properties is generated from investment grade tenants.  These 423 properties, and properties under development, are located in 37 states, will contain over 10.5 million leasable square feet, and are 100% leased with an average lease term of 14.6 years. The tenants of the 423 properties acquired operate in 23 industries: aerospace, apparel stores, automotive collision services, automotive parts, consumer appliances, consumer goods, convenience stores, crafts and novelties, diversified industrial, dollar stores, drug stores, equipment services, food processing, health and fitness, insurance, machinery, motor vehicle dealerships, packaging,



-3-








paper, restaurants – quick service, theaters, transportation services, and wholesale clubs.  None of the investments in these properties caused any one tenant to be 10% or more of our total assets at December 31, 2012.



The initial weighted average contractual lease rate is computed as estimated contractual net operating income (in a net-leased property that is equal to the aggregate base rent or, in the case of a property under development, the estimated base rent) for the first year of each lease, divided by the estimated total cost of the properties. Since it is possible that a tenant could default on the payment of contractual rent, we cannot provide assurance that the actual return on the funds invested will remain at the percentages listed above.



January 2013 Acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc.

On January 22, 2013, we completed our acquisition of American Realty Capital Trust, Inc., or ARCT, in a transaction valued at approximately $3.1 billion.  Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of September 6, 2012, as amended on January 6, 2013, at the effective time of the acquisition, each outstanding share of ARCT common stock was converted into the right to receive a combination of (i) $0.35 in cash and (ii) 0.2874 shares of our common stock.  In connection with the acquisition, at the closing we terminated and repaid the amounts then outstanding of approximately $552.9 million under ARCT’s revolving credit facility and term loan.  In conjunction with our acquisition of ARCT in January 2013, we assumed approximately $516.3 million of mortgages payable.  With this acquisition, we added 515 properties to our portfolio.  Through 2012, we have incurred $7.9 million of merger costs.  We anticipate that the total merger costs will be approximately $19 million.



In January 2013, in connection with our acquisition of ARCT, we entered into a $70 million senior unsecured term loan maturing January 21, 2018.  Borrowing under the term loan bears interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, commonly referred to as LIBOR, plus 1.20%.  In conjunction with this term loan, we also acquired an interest rate swap which essentially fixes our per annum interest rate on the term loan at 2.15%.



Portfolio Discussion



Leasing Results

At December 31, 2012, we had 84 properties available for lease out of 3,013 properties in our portfolio, which represents a 97.2% occupancy rate.  Since December 31, 2011, when we reported 87 properties available for lease and a 96.7% occupancy rate, we:



·Leased 47 properties;

·Sold 20 properties available for lease; and

·Have 64 new properties available for lease.



During 2012, 124 properties with expiring leases were leased to either existing or new tenants.  The rent on these leases was $10.6 million, as compared to the previous rent on these same properties of $10.9 million.  At December 31, 2012, our average annualized rental revenue was approximately $14.56 per square foot on the 2,929 leased properties in our portfolio.  At December 31, 2012, we classified 14 properties with a carrying amount of $19.2 million as held for sale on our balance sheet.



Investments in Existing Properties

In 2012, we capitalized costs of $6.6 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.62 million for re-leasing costs and $4.93 million for building and tenant improvements.  In 2011, we capitalized costs of $4.2 million on existing properties in our portfolio, consisting of $1.7 million for re-leasing costs and $2.5 million for building and tenant improvements.



As part of our re-leasing costs, we pay leasing commissions and sometimes provide tenant rent concessions.  Leasing commissions are paid based on the commercial real estate industry standard and any rent concessions provided are minimal.  We do not consider the collective impact of the leasing commissions or tenant rent concessions to be material to our financial position or results of operations.



The majority of our building and tenant improvements are related to roof repairs, HVAC improvements, and parking lot resurfacing and replacements.  It is not customary for us to offer significant tenant improvements on our properties as tenant incentives.  The amounts of our capital expenditures can vary significantly, depending on the rental market, tenant credit worthiness, and the willingness of tenants to pay higher rents over the terms of the leases.

Note Issuance

In October 2012, we issued $350 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.00% senior unsecured notes due January 2018, or the 2018 Notes, and $450 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.25% senior unsecured notes due October 2022, or the 2022 Notes.  The price to the investors for the 2018 Notes was 99.910% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 2.017% per annum.  The price to the investors for the 2022 Notes was 99.382% of the principal amount for an effective yield of 3.323% per annum.  The total net proceeds of $790.1 million from these offerings were used to repay all outstanding borrowings under our acquisition credit facility, and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including additional property acquisitions.



Universal Shelf Registration

In October 2012, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in October 2015.  This replaces our prior shelf registration statement.  In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit.  The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities.  We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices, and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered.  The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.



Environmental Insurance Policies

In July 2012, we entered into new ten-year environmental primary and excess insurance policies that expire in July 2022.  The limits on our new primary policy are $10 million per occurrence and $60 million in the aggregate.  The limits on the excess policy are $5 million per occurrence and $10 million in the aggregate.  Therefore, the primary and excess ten-year policies together provide a total limit of $15 million per occurrence and $70 million in the aggregate.



Authorized Shares

In June 2012, our stockholders approved an increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock to 370,100,000 and the number of authorized shares of our preferred stock to 69,900,000.



$1 Billion Acquisition Credit Facility

In May 2012, we entered into a new $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility, which replaced our $425 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in March 2014.  The initial term of the new credit facility expires in May 2016 and includes, at our option, a one-year extension.  Under this new credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at LIBOR plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over LIBOR.  The borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling.  We also have other interest rate options available to us.  Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.



2012 Incentive Award Plan

In March 2012, our Board of Directors adopted, and in May 2012, our stockholders approved the Realty Income Corporation 2012 Incentive Award Plan, or the 2012 Plan, to enable us to attract and retain the services of directors, employees and consultants considered essential to our long-term success.  The 2012 Plan offers our directors, employees and consultants an opportunity to own stock in Realty Income or rights that will reflect our growth, development and financial success.  The 2012 Plan replaced the 2003 Incentive Award Plan of Realty Income Corporation (as amended and restated February 21, 2006), which was set to expire in March 2013.



Issuance and Redemption of Preferred Stock

In February 2012, we issued 14.95 million shares of 6.625% Monthly Income Class F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock at a price of $25.00 per share, including 1.95 million shares purchased by the underwriters upon the exercise of their overallotment option. In April 2012, we issued an additional 1.4 million shares of our Class F preferred stock at a price of $25.2863 per share.  Of the aggregate net proceeds of approximately $395.4 million from these issuances, $127.5 million was used to redeem all of our outstanding 7.375% Class D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock and the balance was used to repay borrowings under our credit facility.  The dividend rate difference of 0.75% between the Class D and Class F preferred stock provides us



-5-








savings of $956,000 annually on the Class D redemption amount of $127.5 million.  Beginning February 15, 2017, the Class F preferred shares are redeemable at our option for $25.00 per share. The initial dividend of $0.1702257 per share was paid on March 15, 2012, and covered 37 days.  Thereafter, dividends of $0.138021 per share will be paid monthly, in arrears.



We redeemed all of the 5.1 million shares of our 7.375% Monthly Income Class D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock in March 2012 for $25.00 per share, plus accrued dividends.  We incurred a charge of $3.7 million, representing the Class D preferred stock original issuance costs that we paid in 2004.



Net Income Available to Common Stockholders

Net income available to common stockholders was $114.5 million in 2012, compared to $132.8 million in 2011, a decrease of $18.3 million. On a diluted per common share basis, net income was $0.86 in 2012, as compared to $1.05 in 2011.  Net income available to common stockholders for 2012 includes $7.9 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.06 on a diluted per common share basis, for the acquisition of ARCT.  Additionally, net income available to common stockholders in 2012 includes a $3.7 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our Class D preferred stock, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis.



The calculation to determine net income available to common stockholders includes gains from the sale of properties and excess real estate. The amount of gains varies from period to period based on the timing of property sales and can significantly impact net income available to common stockholders.



Gains from the sale of properties during 2012 were $9.9 million, as compared to gains from the sale of properties and excess real estate of $5.7 million during 2011.



Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (FFO) and Normalized Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (Normalized FFO)

In 2012, our FFO increased by $11.5 million, or 4.6%, to $260.9 million versus $249.4 million in 2011.  On a diluted per common share basis, FFO was $1.96 in 2012, compared to $1.98 in 2011, a decrease of $0.02, or 1.0%.  FFO in 2012 includes $7.9 million of merger-related costs, which represents $0.06 on a diluted per common share basis, and includes a $3.7 million charge for the excess of redemption value over carrying value of the shares of our Class D preferred stock, which represents $0.03 on a diluted per common share basis.



We define normalized FFO as FFO excluding the merger-related costs for our acquisition of ARCT.  In 2012, our normalized FFO increased by $19.4 million, or 7.8%, to $268.8 million, versus $249.4 million in 2011.  On a diluted common share basis, normalized FFO was $2.02 in 2012, compared to $1.98 in 2011, an increase of $0.04, or 2.0%.



See our discussion of FFO and normalized FFO (which are not financial measures under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP), in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO and normalized FFO.



Adjusted Funds from Operations Available to Common Stockholders (AFFO)

In 2012, our AFFO increased by $20.8 million, or 8.2%, to $274.2 million versus $253.4 million in 2011. On a diluted per common share basis, AFFO was $2.06 in 2012, compared to $2.01 in 2011, an increase of $0.05, or 2.5%.



See our discussion of AFFO (which is not a financial measure under GAAP), in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this annual report, which includes a reconciliation of net income available to common stockholders to FFO, normalized FFO and AFFO.

DIVIDEND POLICY



Distributions are paid monthly to our common, Class E preferred and Class F preferred stockholders if, and when, declared by our Board of Directors.



In order to maintain our tax status as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally are required to distribute dividends to our stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains), and we are subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including net capital gains). In 2012, our cash distributions to preferred and common stockholders totaled $275.8 million, or approximately 131.4% of our estimated taxable income of $209.9 million. Our estimated taxable income reflects non-cash deductions for depreciation and amortization. Our estimated taxable income is presented to show our compliance with REIT dividend requirements and is not a measure of our liquidity or operating performance.  We intend to continue to make distributions to our stockholders that are sufficient to meet this dividend requirement and that will reduce or eliminate our exposure to income taxes. Furthermore, we believe our funds from operations are more than sufficient to support our current level of cash distributions to our stockholders. Our 2012 cash distributions to common stockholders totaled $236.3 million, representing 86.2% of our adjusted funds from operations available to common stockholders of $274.2 million.



The Class E preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.75% per annum on the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.6875 per annum per share). The Class F preferred stockholders receive cumulative distributions at a rate of 6.625% per annum on the $25.00 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $1.65625 per annum per share). Dividends on our Class E and Class F preferred stock are current.



Future distributions will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, FFO, normalized FFO, AFFO, cash flow from operations, financial condition and capital requirements, the annual dividend requirements under the REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our debt service requirements and any other factors our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, our credit facility contains financial covenants that could limit the amount of distributions paid by us in the event of a default, and which prohibit the payment of distributions on the common or preferred stock in the event that we fail to pay when due (subject to any applicable grace period) any principal or interest on borrowings under our credit facility.



Distributions of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes generally will be taxable to stockholders as ordinary income, except to the extent that we recognize capital gains and declare a capital gains dividend, or that such amounts constitute “qualified dividend income” subject to a reduced rate of tax. The maximum tax rate of non-corporate taxpayers for “qualified dividend income” is generally 20% (15% for 2012 dividends). In general, dividends payable by REITs are not eligible for the reduced tax rate on qualified dividend income, except to the extent that certain holding requirements have been met with respect to the REIT’s stock and the REIT’s dividends are attributable to dividends received from certain taxable corporations (such as our taxable REIT subsidiary, Crest Net Lease, Inc., or Crest) or to income that was subject to tax at the corporate or REIT level (for example, if we distribute taxable income that we retained and paid tax on in the prior taxable year).



Distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non-taxable reduction in the stockholders’ basis in their stock, but not below zero. Distributions in excess of that basis, generally, will be taxable as a capital gain to stockholders who hold their shares as a capital asset. Approximately 24.5% of the distributions to our common stockholders, made or deemed to have been made in 2012, were classified as a return of capital for federal income tax purposes. We estimate that in 2013, between 15% and 25% of the distributions may be classified as a return of capital.

BUSINESS PHILOSOPHY AND STRATEGY



Capital Philosophy

Historically, we have met our long-term capital needs by issuing common stock, preferred stock and long-term unsecured notes and bonds. Over the long term, we believe that common stock should be the majority of our capital structure. However, we may issue additional preferred stock or debt securities from time to time. We may issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our credit facility or debt securities. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us.



Our primary cash obligations, for the current year and subsequent years, are included in the “Table of Obligations,” which is presented in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”  We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, including property acquisitions and development costs, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common and preferred stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities, borrowing on our $1 billion credit facility and occasionally through public securities offerings.



Conservative Capital Structure

We believe that our stockholders are best served by a conservative capital structure. Therefore, we seek to maintain a conservative debt level on our balance sheet and solid interest and fixed charge coverage ratios. At December 31, 2012, our total outstanding borrowings of senior unsecured notes, mortgages payable and credit facility borrowings were $2.88 billion, or approximately 32.5% of our total market capitalization of $8.88 billion.



We define our total market capitalization at December 31, 2012 as the sum of:



·Shares of our common stock outstanding of 133,452,411 multiplied by the last reported sales price of our common stock on the NYSE of $40.21 per share on December 31, 2012, or $5.37 billion;

·Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25.00 per share) of the Class E preferred stock of $220 million;

·Aggregate liquidation value (par value of $25.00 per share) of the Class F preferred stock of $408.8 million;

·Outstanding borrowings of $158.0 million on our credit facility;

·Outstanding mortgages payable of $175.9 million; and

·Outstanding senior unsecured notes and bonds of $2.55 billion.



At the close of the acquisition of ARCT on January 22, 2013, our total market capitalization increased to over $12 billion.



Investment Philosophy

We believe that owning an actively managed, diversified portfolio of commercial properties under long-term, net leases produces consistent and predictable income. Net leases typically require the tenant to be responsible for monthly rent and property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases. We believe that a portfolio of properties under long-term leases, coupled with the tenant’s responsibility for property expenses, generally produces a more predictable income stream than many other types of real estate portfolios, while continuing to offer the potential for growth in rental income.



Investment Strategy

When identifying new properties for acquisition, we generally focus on providing capital to owners and operators of commercial enterprises by acquiring the real estate they consider important to the successful operation of their business.



-8-








We primarily focus on acquiring properties leased to commercial enterprises based on the following guidelines:



·Tenants with reliable and sustainable cash flow;

·Tenants with revenue and cash flow from multiple sources;

·Large owners and users of real estate;

·Real estate that is critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue (i.e. they need the property in which they operate in order to conduct their business);

·Real estate and tenants that are willing to sign a long-term lease (10 or more years); and

·Property transactions where we can achieve an attractive spread over our cost of capital.



Historically, our investment focus has primarily been on commercial enterprises that have a service component because we believe the lease revenue from these types of businesses is more stable. Because of this investment focus, for the quarter ended December 31, 2012, approximately 70.1% of our retail rental revenue was derived from tenants with a service component in their business. We believe these service-oriented businesses would generally be difficult to duplicate over the Internet and that our properties continue to perform well relative to competition from Internet-based businesses.



Credit Strategy

We typically acquire and lease properties to regional and national commercial enterprises and believe that within this market we can achieve an attractive risk-adjusted return. Since 1970, our occupancy rate at the end of each year has never been below 96%.



We believe the principal financial obligations of most commercial enterprises typically include their bank and other debt, payment obligations to suppliers and real estate lease obligations. Because we typically own the land and building in which a tenant conducts its business or which are critical to the tenant’s ability to generate revenue, we believe the risk of default on a tenant’s lease obligations is less than the tenant’s unsecured general obligations. It has been our experience that since tenants must retain their profitable and critical locations in order to survive, in the event of reorganization they are less likely to reject a lease for a profitable and critical location because this would terminate their right to use the property. Thus, as the property owner, we believe we will fare better than unsecured creditors of the same tenant in the event of reorganization. If a property is rejected by the tenant during reorganization, we own the property and can either lease it to a new tenant or sell the property. In addition, we believe that the risk of default on real estate leases can be further mitigated by monitoring the performance of the tenants’ individual locations and considering whether to sell locations that are weaker performers.



In order to qualify for inclusion in our portfolio, new property acquisitions must meet stringent investment and credit requirements. The properties must generate attractive current yields and the tenant must meet our credit profile.  We have established a four-part analysis that examines each potential investment based on:



·Industry, company, market conditions and credit profile;

·Store profitability for retail locations, if profitability data is available;

·The importance of the real estate location to the operations of the company’s business; and

·Overall real estate characteristics, including property value and comparative rental rates.



Acquisition Strategy

We seek to invest in industries in which several, well-organized, regional and national commercial enterprises are capturing market share through service, quality control, economies of scale, strong consumer brands, advertising, and the selection of prime locations. Our acquisition strategy is to act as a source of capital to regional and national commercial enterprises by acquiring and leasing back their real estate locations. In addition, we frequently acquire large portfolios of properties net leased to multiple tenants in a variety of industries.  We undertake thorough research and analysis to identify what we consider to be appropriate industries, tenants and property locations for investment. Our research expertise is instrumental to uncovering net-lease opportunities in markets where our real estate financing program adds value. In selecting potential investments, we generally seek to acquire real estate that has the following characteristics:



·Properties that are freestanding, commercially-zoned with a single tenant;

·Properties that are important locations for regional and national commercial enterprises;

·Properties that we deem to be profitable for the tenants and/or can generally be characterized as important to the operations of the company’s business;

·Properties that are located within attractive demographic areas, relative to the business of our tenants, with high visibility and easy access to major thoroughfares; and

·Properties that can be purchased with the simultaneous execution or assumption of long-term, net-lease agreements, offering both current income and the potential for rent increases.



Impact of Real Estate and Credit Markets

In the commercial real estate market, property prices generally continue to fluctuate. Likewise, during certain periods, the U.S. credit markets have experienced significant price volatility, dislocations and liquidity disruptions, which may impact our access to and cost of capital. We continually monitor the commercial real estate and U.S. credit markets carefully and, if required, will make decisions to adjust our business strategy accordingly.



Portfolio Management Strategy

The active management of the property portfolio is an essential component of our long-term strategy. We continually monitor our portfolio for any changes that could affect the performance of the industries, tenants and locations in which we have invested. We also regularly analyze our portfolio with a view toward optimizing its returns and enhancing our credit quality.



Our executives regularly review and analyze:

·The performance of the various industries of our tenants; and

·The operation, management, business planning, and financial condition of our tenants.



We have an active portfolio management program that incorporates the sale of assets when we believe the reinvestment of the sale proceeds will:



·Generate higher returns;

·Enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio;

·Extend our average remaining lease term; or

·Decrease tenant or industry concentration.



At December 31, 2012, we classified real estate with a carrying amount of $19.2 million as held for sale on our balance sheet. In 2013, we intend to continue implementing more active disposition efforts to further enhance the credit quality of our real estate portfolio.  As a result, we anticipate selling investment properties from our portfolio that have not yet been specifically identified, from which we anticipate receiving between $50 million and $125 million in proceeds during the next 12 months. We intend to invest these proceeds into new property acquisitions, if there are attractive opportunities available. However, we cannot guarantee that we will sell properties during the next 12 months at our estimated values or be able to invest the property sale proceeds in new properties.



Universal Shelf Registration

In October 2012, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which is effective for a term of three years and will expire in October 2015.  This replaces our prior shelf registration statement.  In accordance with SEC rules, the amount of securities to be issued pursuant to this shelf registration statement was not specified when it was filed and there is no specific dollar limit.  The securities covered by this registration statement include (1) common stock, (2) preferred stock, (3) debt securities, (4) depositary shares representing fractional interests in shares of preferred stock, (5) warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares, and (6) any combination of these securities.  We may periodically offer one or more of these securities in amounts, prices and on terms to be announced when and if the securities are offered.  The specifics of any future offerings, along with the use of proceeds of any securities offered, will be described in detail in a prospectus supplement, or other offering materials, at the time of any offering.

$1 Billion Acquisition Credit Facility

In May 2012, we entered into a new $1 billion unsecured acquisition credit facility, which replaced our $425 million acquisition credit facility that was scheduled to expire in March 2014.  The initial term of the new credit facility expires in May 2016 and includes, at our option, a one-year extension.  Under this new credit facility, our current investment grade credit ratings provide for financing at LIBOR, plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% over LIBOR.  The borrowing rate is not subject to an interest rate floor or ceiling.  We also have other interest rate options available to us.  Our credit facility is unsecured and, accordingly, we have not pledged any assets as collateral for this obligation.  At December 31, 2012, we had a borrowing capacity of $842 million available on our credit facility (subject to customary conditions to borrowing) and an outstanding balance of $158 million.  The interest rate on borrowings outstanding under our new credit facility, at December 31, 2012, was 1.3% per annum.  We must comply with various financial and other covenants in our credit facility.  At December 31, 2012, we remain in compliance with these covenants.



We expect to use our credit facility to acquire additional properties and for other corporate purposes. Any additional borrowings will increase our exposure to interest rate risk. We have the right to request an increase in the borrowing capacity of the credit facility, up to $500 million, to a total borrowing capacity of $1.5 billion.  Any increase in the borrowing capacity is subject to approval by the lending banks participating in our credit facility.



We generally use our credit facility for the short-term financing of new property acquisitions. Thereafter, when capital is available on acceptable terms, we generally seek to refinance those borrowings with the net proceeds of long-term or permanent financing, which may include the issuance of common stock, preferred stock or debt securities. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to obtain any such refinancing, or that market conditions prevailing at the time of the refinancing will enable us to issue equity or debt securities upon acceptable terms.



Cash Reserves

We acquire and lease properties and distribute to stockholders, in the form of monthly cash dividends, a substantial portion of our net cash flow generated from leases on our properties.  We intend to retain an appropriate amount of cash as working capital.  At December 31, 2012, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $5.2 million.



We believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash provided from operating activities, and borrowing capacity is sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future.  We intend, however, to use additional sources of capital to fund property acquisitions and to repay future borrowings under our credit facility.



Credit Agency Ratings

The borrowing interest rates under our credit facility are based upon our credit ratings.  We are currently assigned the following investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes and bonds: Fitch Ratings has assigned a rating of BBB+ with a “stable” outlook, Moody’s Investors Service has assigned a rating of Baa1 with a “negative” outlook, and Standard & Poor’s Ratings Group has assigned a rating of BBB with a “stable” outlook to our senior notes.



Based on our current ratings, the credit facility interest rate is LIBOR plus 1.075% with a facility commitment fee of 0.175%, for all-in drawn pricing of 1.25% basis points over LIBOR.  The credit facility provides that the interest rate can range between: (i) LIBOR plus 1.85% if our credit facility is lower than BBB-/Baa3 and (ii) LIBOR plus 1.00% if our credit rating is A-/A3 or higher.  In addition, our credit facility provides for a facility commitment fee based on our credit ratings, which range from: (i) 0.45% for a rating lower than BBB-/Baa3, and (ii) 0.15% for a credit rating of A-/A3 or higher.



We also issue senior debt securities from time to time and our credit ratings can impact the interest rates on these transactions.  In addition, if our credit ratings or ratings outlook change, our cost to obtain debt financing could increase or decrease.



-11-








The credit ratings assigned to us could change based upon, among other things, our results of operations and financial condition. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies, and we cannot assure you that our ratings will not be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant. Moreover, a rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold our debt securities, preferred stock or common stock.



Mortgage Debt

As of December 31, 2012, we had $165.9 million of mortgages payable, which were assumed in connection with our property acquisitions in 2012 and 2011.  Additionally, at December 31, 2012, we had net premiums totaling $9.9 million on these mortgages.  During 2012, we paid $11.7 million in principal payments, which includes $10.7 million to pay off one mortgage in March 2012.



We expect to pay off the mortgages payable as soon as prepayment penalties and costs make it economically feasible to do so.  We intend to continue our policy of primarily identifying property acquisitions that are free from mortgage indebtedness.



No Unconsolidated Investments

We have no unconsolidated investments, nor do we engage in trading activities involving energy or commodity contracts. Additionally, we have no joint ventures or mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. As such, our financial position and results of operations are not affected by accounting regulations regarding the classification of financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.



Competitive Strategy

To successfully pursue our investment philosophy and strategy, we seek to maintain the following competitive advantages:



·Type of Investment Properties:We believe net-leased properties, whether purchased individually or as part of larger portfolio purchases, represent an attractive investment opportunity in today’s real estate environment. The less intensive day-to-day property management required by net-lease agreements, coupled with the active management of a large portfolio of properties, is an effective investment strategy. The tenants of our freestanding properties generally provide goods and services that satisfy basic consumer needs. In order to grow and expand, they generally need capital. Since the acquisition of real estate is typically the single largest capital expenditure of many of these tenants, our method of purchasing the property and then leasing it back, under a net-lease arrangement, allows the commercial enterprise to free up capital.



·Investment in New Industries:We seek to further diversify our portfolio among a variety of industries. We believe diversification will allow us to invest in industries that currently are growing and have characteristics we find attractive. When analyzing new industries, we seek to acquire properties that are critical to the success of a commercial enterprise, through its distribution of the product or service. Other characteristics may include, but are not limited to, industries that are dominated by local store operators where regional and national commercial enterprises can increase market share and dominance by consolidating local operators and streamlining their operations, as well as capitalizing on major demographic shifts in a population base.



·Diversification:Diversification of the portfolio by industry type, tenant, and geographic location is key to our objective of providing predictable investment results for our stockholders, therefore further diversification of our portfolio is a continuing objective. At December 31, 2012, we owned a diversified property portfolio that consisted of 3,013 properties located in 49 states, leased to 150 different commercial enterprises doing business in 44 industry segments. Each of the 44 industry segments, represented in our property portfolio, individually accounted for no more than 14.9% of our rental revenue for the quarter ended December 31, 2012.



-12-








·Management Specialization:We believe that our management’s specialization in acquiring and managing single-tenant properties, operated under net-lease agreements, purchased individually or as part of a larger portfolio, is important to meeting our objectives. We plan to maintain this specialization and will seek to employ and train high-quality professionals in this specialized area of real estate ownership, finance and management.



·Technology:We intend to stay at the forefront of technology in our efforts to carry out our operations efficiently and economically. We maintain sophisticated information systems that allow us to analyze our portfolio’s performance and actively manage our investments. We believe that technology and information-based systems play an important role in our competitiveness as an investment manager and source of capital to a variety of industries and tenants.



Corporate Responsibility

Realty Income is committed to providing an enjoyable, diverse and safe working atmosphere for our employees, to upholding our responsibilities as a public company operating for the benefit of our shareholders and to being mindful of the environment.  As The Monthly Dividend Company®, we believe our primary responsibility is to provide a dividend return to our shareholders. How we manage and use the physical, human and financial resources that enable us to acquire and own the real estate, which provides us with the lease revenue to pay monthly dividends, demonstrates our commitment to corporate responsibility.



Social Responsibility and Ethics.We are committed to being socially responsible and conducting our business according to the highest ethical standards. Our employees enjoy compensation that is in line with those of our peers and competitors, including generous healthcare benefits for employees and their families; participation in a 401K plan with a matching contribution by Realty Income; competitive vacation and time-off benefits; paid maternity leave and an infant-at-work program for new parents.  Our employees also have access to members of our Board of Directors to report any suspicion of misconduct, by any member of our senior management or executive team.  We also have a long-standing commitment to equal employment opportunity and adhere to all Equal Employer Opportunity Policy guidelines.



With respect to our vendors and tenants we apply the principles of full and fair disclosure in all of our business dealings, as outlined in our Corporate Code of Business Ethics. We are also committed to dealing fairly with all of our customers, suppliers and competitors.



Corporate Governance.We believe that nothing is more important than a company’s reputation for integrity and serving as a responsible fiduciary for its shareholders. We are committed to managing the company for the benefit of our shareholders and are focused on maintaining good corporate governance.  Practices that illustrate this commitment include:



·Our Board of Directors is comprised of six independent, non-employee directors and one employee director (the Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman of the Board)

·Our Board of Directors is elected on an annual basis

·We employ a majority vote standard for elections

·Our Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors works with independent consultants, in conducting annual compensation reviews for our key executives, and compensates each individual based on reaching certain performance metrics that determine the success of our company

·We adhere to all other corporate governance principles outlined in our “Corporate Governance Guidelines” document.



Environmental Practices.Our focus on energy related matters is demonstrated by how we manage our day-to-day activities in our corporate headquarters building.  With respect to other properties that we own, which are net-leased to our tenants who are responsible for maintaining the buildings, we encourage energy conservation and environmental sustainability practices wherever possible.  In our headquarters building we promote energy conservation and encourage the following practices:



·Powering down office equipment at the end of the day

·Setting fax and copier machines to “energy saver mode”

·Encouraging employees to use “duplex” copy mode to reduce paper usage whenever possible

·Employing an automated “lights out” system that is activated 24/7



-13-








·Programming HVAC to only operate during normal business operating hours



In addition, our headquarters building was constructed according to the State of California energy standards and we have installed solar panels on our roof to fulfill our energy requirements. All of the windows on our building are dual-paned to increase energy efficiency and reduce our carbon footprint.



With respect to recycling and reuse practices, we encourage the use of recycled products and the recycling of materials during our operations.  Recycling bins are placed in all areas where materials are regularly disposed of and at the individual desks of our employees. Cell phones, wireless devices and office equipment is recycled or donated whenever possible.  We also continue to pursue a paperless environment since this reduces costs and saves trees.  As a result, we encourage file-sharing networks and environments to produce and edit documents in order to reduce the dissemination of hard copy documents.



PROPERTY PORTFOLIO INFORMATION



At December 31, 2012, we owned a diversified portfolio:



·Of 3,013 properties;

·With an occupancy rate of 97.2%, or 2,929 properties leased and only 84 properties available for lease;

·Leased to 150 different commercial enterprises doing business in 44 separate industries;

·Located in 49 states;

·With over 37.6 million square feet of leasable space; and

·With an average leasable space per property of approximately 12,500 square feet.



At December 31, 2012, of our 3,013 properties, 2,913 were leased under net-lease agreements. A net lease typically requires the tenant to be responsible for minimum monthly rent and certain property operating expenses including property taxes, insurance and maintenance. In addition, our tenants are typically subject to future rent increases based on increases in the consumer price index (typically subject to ceilings), additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenants’ gross sales above a specified level, or fixed increases.



In order to more accurately reflect our exposure to various industries, the following industry table has been modified from similar tables we have prepared in the past to reflect the changes below:



·Some properties previously included in the “general merchandise” industry were reclassified to the “dollar stores” industry to better reflect the industry in which the tenant operates; and

·The “aviation” industry was renamed “aerospace.”
