CNA FINANCIAL
CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated
in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA’s property and casualty and remaining life & group insurance operations are primarily conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), incorporated in 1897, and The
Continental Insurance Company (“CIC”), organized in 1853, and certain other affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation (“Continental”). CNA accounted for
63.4%, 63.0% and 60.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

CNA’s insurance products primarily include commercial property and casualty coverages, including surety. CNA’s services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims
administration. CNA’s products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, associations, professionals
and other groups.

CNA’s core business, commercial property and casualty insurance operations, is
reported in two business segments: CNA Specialty and CNA Commercial. CNA’s non-core businesses are managed in two business segments: Life & Group Non-Core and Other Insurance. Each segment is managed separately due to
differences in their product lines and markets.

CNA’s property and casualty field structure consists of
48 underwriting locations across the United States. There are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities, and also act as call centers to optimize service. The claims structure consists
of two regional claim centers designed to efficiently handle the high volume of low severity claims including property damage, liability, and workers’ compensation medical only claims, and 16 principal claim office locations handling the more
complex claims. In addition, CNA has underwriting and claim capabilities in Canada and Europe.

CNA Specialty

CNA Specialty provides professional and management liability and other coverages through property and casualty products
and services, both domestically and abroad, through a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters. CNA Specialty provides solutions for managing the risks of its clients, including architects,







lawyers, accountants, health care professionals, financial intermediaries and public and private companies. Product offerings also include surety and fidelity bonds and warranty services.

CNA Specialty includes the following business groups:

Professional & Management Liability: Professional & Management Liability provides
management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages in the United States. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including
architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and technology firms. Professional & Management Liability also provides directors and officers (“D&O”), employment practices, fiduciary and
fidelity coverages. Specific areas of focus include small and mid-size firms as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit organizations, where tailored products for this client segment are offered. Products within Professional &
Management Liability are distributed through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Professional & Management Liability, through CNA HealthPro, also offers insurance products to serve the health care industry.
Products include professional liability and associated standard property and casualty coverages, and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer segments include long term
care facilities, allied health care providers, life sciences, dental professionals and mid-size and large health care facilities.

International: International provides similar management and professional liability insurance and other specialized property and casualty coverages in Canada and Europe.

Surety: Surety offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. CNA Surety provides
surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a network of independent agencies.

Warranty and
Alternative Risks:Warranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for
vehicles and portable electronic communication devices. These products are distributed through and administered by CNA’s wholly owned subsidiary, CNA National Warranty Corporation, or through third party administrators.

CNA Commercial

CNA Commercial works with an independent agency distribution system and a network of brokers to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products and services to small, middle-market and
large businesses and organizations domestically and abroad. Property products include standard and excess property coverages, as well as marine coverage, and boiler and machinery. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products such
as workers’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs to those
customers viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure.

These property and casualty products are
offered as part of CNA’sSmall Business, CommercialandInternationalinsurance groups. CNA’s Small Business insurance group serves its smaller commercial accounts and the Commercial insurance group serves CNA’s middle
markets and its larger risks. In addition, CNA Commercial provides total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace, through a wholly owned subsidiary, CNA ClaimPlus, Inc., a
third party administrator. The International insurance group primarily consists of the commercial product lines of CNA’s operations in Europe and Canada.

Also included in CNA Commercial isCNA Select Risk (“Select Risk”), which includes CNA’s excess and surplus lines coverages. Select Risk provides specialized insurance for selected
commercial risks on both an individual customer and program basis. Customers insured by Select Risk are generally viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure than those covered by standard insurance markets. Select Risk’s products
are distributed throughout the United States through specialist producers, program agents and brokers.







Life & Group Non-Core

The Life & Group Non-Core segment primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business that
are in run-off. CNA continues to service its existing individual long term care commitments, its payout annuity business and its pension deposit business. CNA also retains a block of group reinsurance and life settlement contracts. These businesses
are being managed as a run-off operation. CNA’s group long term care business, while considered non-core, continues to accept new employees in existing groups.

Other Insurance

Other Insurance primarily includes
certain CNA corporate expenses, including interest on CNA corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”). In 2010, CNA ceded
substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities under the Loss Portfolio Transfer, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Please read Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
by Business Segment – CNA Financial” for information with respect to each segment.

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property and
casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance companies. The table excludes CNA’s life insurance subsidiaries, and as such, the carried reserves will
not agree to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the
end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s
property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and
indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.







The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending
balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. The development amounts in the table below include the impact of reinsurance commutations, but exclude the impact
of the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables.

Other

Competition:The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service.
CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. CNA must
continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.

There are
approximately 2,500 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2010 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the 13th largest property and casualty
insurance organization in the United States.

Regulation:The insurance industry is subject to
comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing
reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which
require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators,
depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment.

The European Union’s executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called Solvency II that would apply to CNA’s European
operations. In addition, global regulators, including the United States National Association of Insurance Commissioners, are working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) to consider changes to insurance
company supervision. Among the areas being addressed are company and group capital requirements, group supervision and enterprise risk management. It is not currently clear to what extent the activities of the IAIS will impact CNA or U.S. insurance
regulation.

Insurers are also required by the state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who
would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally
a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further,
insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers. Other insurance-related assessments are
generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical
analysis and ratemaking process.

Although the federal government does not directly regulate the business of
insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals; proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures; terrorism risk
mechanisms; federal financial services reforms; various tax proposals affecting insurance companies; and possible regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions arising from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as
well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, both enacted in 2010.







Various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability
system have, and will continue to, impact CNA’s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by
federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. For example, some state legislatures have from time to time considered legislation addressing direct actions against insurers related to bad faith
claims. As a result of this unpredictability in the law, insurance underwriting is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and other specialty coverages.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act expands the federal presence in insurance oversight and may
increase the regulatory requirements to which CNA may be subject. The Act’s requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance (property or casualty insurance placed from insurers that are
eligible to accept insurance, but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state). The Act also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health
insurance, certain long term care insurance and crop insurance, to, among other things, monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or
the overall financial system, coordinate federal policy on international insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances. The Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act may increase CNA’s operating costs and underwriting losses. This landmark legislation may lead to numerous changes in the health care industry that could create additional operating costs for CNA, particularly with respect to its
workers’ compensation and long term care products. These costs might arise through the increased use of health care services by CNA’s claimants or the increased complexities in health care bills that could require additional levels of
review. In addition, due to the expected number of new participants in the health care system and the potential for additional malpractice claims, CNA may experience increased underwriting risk in the lines of its business that provide management
and professional liability insurance to individuals and businesses engaged in the health care industry. The lines of CNA’s business that provide professional liability insurance to attorneys, accountants and other professionals who advise
clients regarding the health care reform legislation may also experience increased underwriting risk due to the complexity of the legislation.

Properties:The Chicago location houses CNA’s principal executive offices. CNA’s subsidiaries own or lease office space in various cities throughout the United States and in other
countries. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to CNA’s principal office locations:

DIAMOND OFFSHORE
DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”) is engaged, through its
subsidiaries, in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that are used in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Diamond Offshore accounted for
23.6%, 23.0% and 25.9% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Rigs:Diamond Offshore owns 49 offshore rigs, consisting of 32 semisubmersible rigs, 13 jack-ups and four dynamically positioned drillships, three of which are under construction with delivery
expected in the second and fourth quarters of 2013 and in the second quarter of 2014. Diamond Offshore’s diverse fleet enables it to offer a broad range of services worldwide in both the floater market (ultra-deepwater, deepwater and mid-water)
and the non-floater, or jack-up, market.

A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling unit that floats
and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs
operate in a “semi-submerged” position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersible rigs
hold position while drilling by use of a series of small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (“DP”) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the sea bed. While DP semisubmersibles are
self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with the assistance of tug boats, while non-DP, or moored, semisubmersible rigs require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.

A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel which is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by
means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a dynamic-positioning system similar to those used
on semisubmersible rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s floater fleet (semisubmersibles and drillships) can be
further categorized based on the nominal water depth for each class of rig as follows:



CategoryNominal Water Depth (a) (in feet)Number of Units in Fleet (b)Ultra-Deepwater7,501 to 12,00011 (c)Deepwater5,000 to 7,5006 (d)Mid-Water400 to 4,99919



(a)Nominal water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the current operating water depth capability for each drilling rig. However,
individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions). On a case by case basis, Diamond Offshore may achieve even greater
depth capacity by providing additional equipment.

(b)Includes seven ultra-deepwater, one deepwater and one mid-water dynamically positioned rigs.

(c)Includes three drillships under construction, as well as one operating drillship.

(d)Includes a rig to be constructed utilizing the hull of one of Diamond Offshore’s existing mid-water floaters.

Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor.
Diamond Offshore’s jack-ups are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit of a particular rig is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. The rig hull includes the drilling rig,
jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport and other related equipment. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a vessel, with its legs
retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until they are firm and stable, and resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the surface of the
water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for







relocation to another drillsite. Most of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are equipped with a cantilever system that enables the rig to cantilever or extend its drilling package over the aft
end of the rig.

Fleet Enhancements and Additions:Diamond Offshore’s long term strategy is
to upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices, and otherwise by enhancing the capabilities of its existing rigs at a lower cost
and reduced construction period than newbuild construction would require. Since December of 2010, Diamond Offshore has entered into three separate turnkey contracts with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., for the construction of three
dynamically positioned, ultra-deepwater drillships with deliveries scheduled for the second and fourth quarters of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014. Diamond Offshore expects the aggregate cost for the three drillships, including commissioning,
spares and project management, to be approximately $1.8 billion.

During 2009, Diamond Offshore acquired two
new-build ultra-deepwater, dynamically positioned, semisubmersible drilling rigs. Including Diamond Offshore’s rig acquisitions in 2009 and its three drillships on order, Diamond Offshore has purchased, ordered or upgraded eight rigs with
capabilities in nominal water depths of 10,000 feet over the last five years.

In December of 2011, Diamond
Offshore entered into an agreement for the construction of a moored semisubmersible rig, which will be designed to operate in water depths up to 6,000 feet. The rig will be constructed utilizing the hull of one of Diamond Offshore’s mid-water
floaters that previously operated as theOcean Voyager. The rig will be constructed in Brownsville, Texas and is expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2013 at an aggregate cost of approximately $300 million, including
commissioning, spares and project management costs.

Diamond Offshore will evaluate further rig acquisition
and upgrade opportunities as they arise. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or upgrades to its fleet.

Markets:The principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the following:



•South America, principally offshore Brazil;



•Australia and Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam;



•the Middle East, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia;



•Europe, principally in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Norway;



•East and West Africa;



•the Mediterranean Basin, including Egypt; and



•the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world.

Diamond Offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in
many respects. For example, Diamond Offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and other international areas in which Diamond Offshore operates, while production
experience it has gained through its Brazilian and North Sea operations has potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond Offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market segment or area enables it to better understand that
customer’s needs and better serve that customer in different market segments or other geographic locations.

Drilling Contracts:Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a
competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Drilling contracts generally provide







for a basic fixed dayrate regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being
moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig, including wages
and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to
earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance.

The duration of a dayrate drilling contract
is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts
may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the
control of either party to the contract. Certain of Diamond Offshore’s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice, and in most circumstances, this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the
customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the
time of the extension.

Customers:Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a
customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, Diamond Offshore performed services for 52, 46 and 47 different customers. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, one of
Diamond Offshore’s customers in Brazil, Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government), accounted for 35%, 24% and 15% of Diamond
Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues. OGX Petróleo e Gás Ltda., or (“OGX”), (a privately owned Brazilian oil and natural gas company), accounted for 14% of Diamond Offshore’s total consolidated revenues in
each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Brazil is one of the most active floater markets in the world today. As of the date of this Report, the greatest
concentration of Diamond Offshore’s operating assets is offshore Brazil, where it has 14 rigs currently working. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore Brazil is $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and
$1.0 billion for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, and $607 million in the aggregate for the years 2015 to 2016.

Competition:The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry
participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The offshore contract drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large
competitors. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have almost 760 mobile rigs available worldwide.

The offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors, including global economies and
demand for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in
determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. Diamond Offshore
believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Diamond Offshore competes on a worldwide basis,
but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a cost that may be substantial, from one region to
another. It is characteristic of the offshore contract drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. Significant new rig construction and upgrades of existing
drilling units could also intensify price competition.







Governmental Regulation:Diamond Offshore’s operations are
subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and
clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for
approximately 90.3%, 80.9% and 66.0% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

Properties:Diamond Offshore owns an eight-story office building totaling 170,000 square feet on 6.2 acres of land located in Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located, two
buildings totaling 39,000 square feet and 20 acres of land in New Iberia, Louisiana, for its offshore drilling warehouse and storage facility, a 13,000-square foot building and five acres of land in Aberdeen, Scotland, for its North Sea operations,
two buildings totaling 77,200 square feet and 11 acres of land in Macae, Brazil, for its South American operations and two buildings totaling 21,000 square feet and two acres of land in Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico, for its Mexican operations.
Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Louisiana, Australia, Indonesia, Norway, Malaysia, Singapore, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Angola, Vietnam and the U.K. to support its offshore drilling
operations.

HIGHMOUNT EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION LLC

HighMount is engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and oil (including condensate and
natural gas liquids (“NGLs”)). HighMount accounted for 2.5%, 2.9% and 4.4% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

HighMount’s proved reserves and production are primarily located in the Sonora field, a tight sands gas formation
within the Permian Basin in West Texas. HighMount holds mineral rights on over 700,000 net acres in the Permian Basin, with over 6,000 producing wells.

In 2011, HighMount acquired working interests in undeveloped oil and gas properties located on approximately 74,000 net acres in Oklahoma and approximately 12,000 net acres in the Texas Panhandle.
HighMount believes that these properties contain primarily oil and liquids reserves which can be produced through horizontal drilling.

HighMount’s interests in developed and undeveloped acreage, wellbores and well facilities generally take the form of working interests in leases that have varying terms. HighMount’s interests in
these properties are, in many cases, held jointly with third parties and may be subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements with other parties as is customary in the
oil and gas industry. HighMount also owns and operates approximately 3,000 miles of gathering lines and over 75,000 horsepower of compression which are used to transport natural gas and NGLs principally from HighMount’s producing wells to
processing plants and pipelines owned by third parties.







We use the following terms throughout this discussion of HighMount’s
business, with “equivalent” volumes computed with oil and NGL quantities converted to Mcf, on an energy equivalent ratio of one barrel to six Mcf:





Average price-Average price during the twelve-month period, prior to the date of the estimate, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements with customers, excluding escalations based upon future conditions

Bbl-Barrel (of oil or NGLs)

Bcf-Billion cubic feet (of natural gas)

Bcfe-Billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Developed acreage-Acreage assignable to productive wells

Gross acres-Total acres in which HighMount owns a mineral interest

Gross wells-Total number of wells in which HighMount owns a mineral interest

Mcf-Thousand cubic feet (of natural gas)

Mcfe-Thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

MMBbl-Million barrels (of oil or NGLs)

MMBtu-Million British thermal units

MMcf-Million cubic feet (of natural gas)

MMcfe-Million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Net acres-The sum of all gross acres covered by a lease or other arrangement multiplied by the mineral interest owned by HighMount in such gross
acreage

NGLNatural Gas Liquids – largely ethane and propane as well as some heavier hydrocarbons

Productive wells-Producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production

Proved reserves-Quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations

Proved developed reserves-Proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment, infrastructure and operating methods

Proved undeveloped reserves-Proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required

Tcf-Trillion cubic feet (of natural gas)

Tcfe-Trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Undeveloped acreage-Leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or
gas

As of December 31, 2011, HighMount owned 1.1 Tcfe of net proved reserves, of which
75% were classified as proved developed reserves. HighMount’s estimated total proved reserves consist of 819.4 Bcf of natural gas, 48.3 MMBbls of NGLs, and 4.0 MMBbls of oil and condensate. HighMount produced approximately 173 MMcfe per day of
net natural gas, NGLs and oil during 2011. HighMount holds leasehold or drilling rights in 0.7 million net acres, of which 0.5 million is developed acreage and the balance is held for future exploration and development drilling
opportunities. HighMount participated in the drilling of 63 wells during 2011, of which 56 (or 88.9%) are productive wells.

Reserves:HighMount’s reserves represent its share of reserves based on its net revenue interest in each property. Estimated reserves as of December 31, 2011 are based
upon studies for each of HighMount’s properties prepared by HighMount staff engineers and are the responsibility of management. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum
industry and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidelines.

HighMount
employs various internal controls to validate the reserve estimation process. The main internal controls include (i) detailed reviews of reserve-related information by reserve engineering and executive management, (ii) reserve audits
performed by an independent third party reserve auditor, (iii) segregation of duties, and (iv) system reconciliation or automated interface between various systems used in the reserve estimation process.







HighMount employs a team of reservoir engineers that specialize in
HighMount’s areas of operation. The reservoir engineering team reports to HighMount’s Chief Operating Officer. The compensation of HighMount’s reservoir engineers is not dependent on the quantity of reserves booked. HighMount’s
lead evaluator has over 28 years of oil and gas engineering experience in the reservoir discipline. He is a member in good standing of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

HighMount’s reserves estimates for 2011 have been independently audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates,
Inc. (“NSAI”), a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and governmental agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers
Registration No. F-2699. The technical person primarily responsible for NSAI’s audit and audit letter has 31 years of industry experience and has been practicing consulting petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1989.

The following table sets forth HighMount’s proved reserves at December 31, 2011, based on average 2011 prices
of $4.12 per MMBtu for natural gas, $55.18 per Bbl for NGLs and $96.19 per Bbl for oil. Substantially all proved reserves were located in the Permian Basin.

HighMount reviews its proved reserves on an annual basis. During 2011, total proved
reserves declined 166 Bcfe, reflecting (i) a 151 Bcfe reduction as a result of recent higher decline rates of producing wells and economic factors such as lower gas prices and higher operating expenses, (ii) a 63 Bcfe reduction as a result
of production during the year, offset by (iii) additions of 48 Bcfe through drilling and proven undeveloped locations.

At December 31, 2011, HighMount had proved undeveloped reserves of 283 Bcfe. During 2011, HighMount recorded negative net reserve revisions of 20 Bcfe primarily due to a reclassification of proved
undeveloped reserves to the non-proved category because these reserves were no longer economical due to the decrease in natural gas prices. Also, 29 Bcfe of non-proved reserves were promoted to the proved undeveloped category as a result of the 2011
drilling activity and increased NGL and oil prices. During 2011, HighMount spent $25 million to convert 14 Bcfe from proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves through drilling.

Estimated net quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 and changes in
the reserves during 2011, 2010 and 2009 are shown in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

HighMount’s properties typically have relatively long reserve lives, high well completion success rates and predictable production profiles. Based on December 31, 2011 proved reserves and
HighMount’s average production from these properties during 2011, the average reserve-to-production index of HighMount’s proved reserves is 18 years.

In order to replenish reserves as they are depleted by production, and to increase reserves, HighMount develops its existing acreage by drilling new wells and, where available, employing new technologies
and drilling strategies designed to enhance production from existing wells. In addition, HighMount seeks to acquire additional acreage in its core areas of operation, as well as other locations where its management has identified an opportunity. For
example, in 2011, HighMount acquired acreage in the Mississippian Lime play in Oklahoma and the Anadarko Basin in the Texas Panhandle.







During 2011, 2010 and 2009, HighMount engaged in the drilling activity
presented in the following table:

In addition, at December 31, 2011, HighMount had 30 (29.3 net) wells in progress.

Acreage:As of December 31, 2011, HighMount owned interests in developed and undeveloped
acreage in the locations set forth in the table below:



Developed AcreageUndeveloped AcreageTotal AcreageGrossNetGrossNetGrossNetPermian Basin584,135446,544228,56887,378812,703533,922Other (a)12,5366,275362,022211,533374,558217,808Total596,671452,819590,590298,9111,187,261751,730



(a)Represents acreage in Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle.

As of December 31, 2011, leases covering 45,256, 41,505 and 24,425 of HighMount’s net acreage will expire by
December 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014, if production is not established or HighMount takes no other action to extend the terms.

Production and Sales:Please see the Production and Sales statistics table for additional information included in the MD&A under Item 7.

HighMount utilizes its own marketing and sales personnel to market the natural gas and oil that it produces to large
energy companies and intrastate pipelines and gathering companies. Production is typically sold and delivered directly to a pipeline at liquid pooling points or at the tailgates of various processing plants, where it then enters a pipeline system.
Permian Basin natural gas sales prices are primarily at a Houston Ship Channel Index.

To manage the risk of
fluctuations in prevailing commodity prices, HighMount enters into commodity and basis swaps and other derivative instruments.

Wells:As of December 31, 2011, HighMount had an interest in 6,352 gross producing wells (5,839 net producing wells) located primarily in the Permian Basin. Wells located in the Permian
Basin have a typical well depth in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 feet.

Competition:HighMount
competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business, including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services. HighMount also competes
in the marketing of produced natural gas and oil. Some of HighMount’s competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire producing properties include
available funds, available information about the property and standards established by HighMount for minimum projected return on investment. Natural gas and oil also compete with alternative fuel sources, including heating oil and coal.







Governmental Regulation:All of HighMount’s operations are
conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other
things: permits to drill and to conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and
restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; and the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding
the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of properties; maximum rates of production from wells; venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production.

HighMount uses hydraulic fracturing to stimulate the production of oil and natural gas. In recent years, concerns have
been raised that the fracturing process may, among other things, contaminate underground sources of drinking water. Several bills have been introduced in Congress seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, which has historically been
regulated at the state level, though none of the proposed legislation has been passed into law. HighMount believes that similar bills will continue to be introduced in Congress; however, it cannot predict whether any such bill will be passed into
law or, if passed, the substance of any such new law.

The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the
Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) to prohibit natural gas market manipulation by any entity, directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) to facilitate market transparency in the sale or transportation of physical natural gas
and significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA of 1938, the NGA of 1978, or FERC regulations or orders thereunder. In addition, HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the
U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and state agencies with respect to safety and operating conditions.

HighMount’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and
disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and
air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s operations may require it to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges into surface waters, and the
construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non-hazardous oilfield wastes. HighMount could be required, without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal, to
remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination.

In September of 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) adopted regulations under the
Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by certain large U.S. GHG emitters. Affected companies are required to monitor their GHG emissions and report to the EPA beginning in March of
2011. Oil and gas exploration and production companies that emit less than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year from any facility (as defined in the regulations), including HighMount, are not required to monitor or report emissions at this time.
However, the EPA has indicated it will issue a proposed rule for comment as it pertains to oil and gas systems.

Properties:In addition to its interests in oil and gas producing properties, HighMount leases an aggregate
of approximately 56,300 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas, which includes its corporate headquarters, and approximately 92,000 square feet of office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. HighMount also leases other surface rights and office,
warehouse and storage facilities necessary to operate its business.







BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage
of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 8.1%, 7.7% and 6.4% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

We own approximately 61% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of 102,719,466 common units, 22,866,667 class B units and a 2%
general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights which entitle the general partner to an
increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates three interstate natural gas pipelines, with approximately 14,200 miles of interconnected pipelines, directly serving customers in 12 states and indirectly serving
customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. In 2011, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.7 Tcf of gas. Average daily throughput on Boardwalk
Pipeline’s pipeline systems during 2011 was approximately 7.3 Bcf. Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 11 underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of
approximately 167 Bcf.

Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including producers, local
distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, direct industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.

In December of 2011, Boardwalk HP Storage Company, LLC (“HP Storage”), a joint venture between Boardwalk
Pipeline and BPHC, acquired seven salt dome natural gas storage caverns and associated assets in Mississippi for approximately $550 million. HP Storage funded the acquisition with proceeds from a $200 million five year variable rate term loan and
equity contributions from BPHC and Boardwalk Pipeline. BPHC contributed $280 million for an 80% interest in HP Storage and Boardwalk Pipeline contributed $70 million for a 20% interest. Boardwalk Pipeline operates the assets of HP Storage on behalf
of the joint venture.

The pipeline systems of Boardwalk Pipeline consist of the following:

The Gulf Crossing pipeline system, which originates in Texas and proceeds into Louisiana, operates approximately 360
miles of natural gas pipeline. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.7 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 1.2 Bcf per day.

The Gulf South pipeline system runs approximately 7,600 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Gulf South has two natural gas storage facilities with 83.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 6.9 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year
ended December 31, 2011 was 4.3 Bcf per day.

The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East
Texas and Arkansas and runs for approximately 6,100 miles north and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day
delivery capacity of 4.6 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 3.2 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s current expansion projects include the following:

South Texas Eagle Ford Expansion: The South Texas Eagle Ford Expansion construction project consists of 55 miles of
gathering pipeline and a cryogenic processing plant. The system will have the capability of gathering in excess of 0.3 Bcf per day of liquids rich gas in the Eagle Ford Shale production area in Texas and processing up to 150 MMcf per day of wet gas.
Boardwalk Pipeline will also provide re-delivery of processed residue gas to a number of interstate and intrastate pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline has executed long term fee-based gathering and processing agreements for approximately 50% of the
plant’s processing capacity. The plant and new pipeline are estimated to cost approximately $180 million and are expected to be placed in service in early 2013.







Marcellus Gathering System: The Marcellus Gathering System is part of a
15 year definitive gas gathering agreement between Boardwalk Pipeline and Southwestern Energy Production Company (“Southwestern”) which will require construction of a natural gas gathering system in Pennsylvania. Boardwalk Pipeline will
own the gas gathering system that will support Southwestern’s development of Marcellus Shale gas. The gathering system is expected to have a delivery capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf per day when fully constructed and the first portion of the
system is expected to be placed in service in April of 2012. The project is expected to cost approximately $90 million.

HP Storage: HP Storage is in the process of leaching a new salt dome storage cavern which is expected to have working gas capacity of approximately 5.0 Bcf. The additional capacity is expected to be
placed in service in the first quarter of 2013 with an estimated cost of approximately $35 million.

Competition:Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous other pipelines that provide natural gas
transportation and storage services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to new gas supply sources that are being developed closer to some of its traditional market areas and
that customers can access through third party pipelines. In addition, regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk Pipeline’s
traditional customers. As a result of the regulators’ policies, segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s services. Further, natural gas competes with
other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources.

The principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of
competition other than pricing, in particular flexibility, terms of service and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is
focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems to meet the demands of customers, such as power generators and industrial users, and is continually reviewing
its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options.

Seasonality:Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues can be affected by weather and natural gas price levels and
volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can
result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak
demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues. In 2011, approximately 53% of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s revenue was recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

Governmental
Regulation:







Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the DOT under the Natural Gas
Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title I of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, which regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline has received
authority from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency of DOT, to operate certain pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those assets at higher than normal operating
pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (“SMYS”). Operating at higher than normal operating pressures will allow each of these pipelines to transport all of the volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted
for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate these pipelines at higher pressures. PHMSA has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to
implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and take additional measures to protect pipeline segments located in highly populated areas. A recently enacted pipeline safety bill could result
in increased regulatory requirements.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive
federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. Such regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage,
transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline’s
facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.

Properties:Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 108,000 square feet of leased office space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also has approximately 108,000 square
feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky in a building that it owns. Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on
property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents.







LOEWS HOTELS HOLDING CORPORATION

The subsidiaries of Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), our wholly owned subsidiary, presently
operate the following 17 hotels. Loews Hotels accounted for 2.4%, 2.1% and 2.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

(b)A Loews Hotels subsidiary is a 50% owner of these hotels located at the Universal Orlando theme park, through a joint venture. The hotels are on
land leased by the joint venture and are operated by Loews Hotels pursuant to a management contract.

The hotels owned by Loews Hotels are subject to mortgage indebtedness totaling approximately $213 million at December 31, 2011 with interest rates ranging from 1.7% to 6.3%, and maturing between 2012
and 2028. In addition, certain hotels are held under leases which are subject to formula derived rental increases, with rentals aggregating approximately $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2011.







Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all
areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than
those in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service. Because of the competitive nature of
the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

Including our operating subsidiaries
