Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property
and casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance companies. The December 31, 2013 claim and claim adjustment expense reserves in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet under Item 8 include amounts related to CNA’s life insurance subsidiary, therefore the reserves in this table as of that date do not agree to the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The first section shows the reserves as originally
reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows
re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the
unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.







The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending balances
should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years.

Item 8.

Investments

Please read Item 7, MD&A – Investments and Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included under Item 8.

Other

Competition:The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service.
CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength. CNA must
continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.

There are approximately 2,700
individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2013 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the eighth largest commercial insurance writer and the 13th largest property and casualty insurance
organization in the United States.

Regulation:The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and
detailed regulation and supervision. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements,
prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which require that rates not
be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators, depending on the size of such
transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment.

Hardy is also supervised by the Council of Lloyd’s, which is the franchisor for all Lloyd’s operations. The Council
of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd’s underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and
approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for business planning and monitoring for all syndicates.

The European Union’s executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management
regulations called Solvency II that would apply to CNA’s European operations. Additionally, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) continues to consider regulatory proposals addressing group supervision,
capital requirements and enterprise risk management. The U.S. Federal Insurance Office and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners are working with other global regulators to define such proposals. It is not currently clear to what
extent the IAIS activities will impact CNA as any final proposal would ultimately need to be legislated or regulated by each individual country or state.

Domestic insurers are also required by state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be
considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its
respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.







Further, insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other
insurance-related assessments. Guaranty funds are governed by state insurance guaranty associations which levy assessments to meet the funding needs of insolvent insurer estates. Other insurance-related assessments are generally levied by state
agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking
process.

Additionally, various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to,
impact CNA’s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that
continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders.

DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”) is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the business of
operating drilling rigs that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated based on market demand. Diamond Offshore
accounted for 19.7%, 20.0% and 21.8% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

Rigs:Diamond Offshore owns 38 offshore drilling rigs, excluding three mid-water semisubmersible rigs that
it plans to retire and scrap. Diamond Offshore’s fleet consists of 27 semisubmersible rigs, including one which is under construction, six jack-ups and five dynamically positioned drillships, including one which is also under construction.
Diamond Offshore’s diverse fleet enables it to offer a broad range of services worldwide in both the floater market (ultra-deepwater, deepwater and mid-water) and the non-floater, or jack-up market.

A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling unit that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class
includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position,
remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersible rigs hold position while drilling by use of a series of
small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (“DP”) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with
the assistance of tug boats. Non-DP, or moored, semisubmersible rigs require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.

A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel which is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means
of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s floater fleet (semisubmersibles and drillships) can be further categorized based on the nominal
water depth for each class of rig as follows:



CategoryRated Water Depth (a) (in feet)Number of Units in FleetUltra-Deepwater7,501    to    12,00013 (b)Deepwater5,000    to      7,5007Mid-Water400    to      4,99912



(a)Rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed to operate.
However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on various conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).

(b)Includes one drillship and one harsh environment semisubmersible rig under construction.

Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor. Diamond
Offshore’s jack-ups are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit of a particular rig is able to operate is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. The rig hull includes the drilling
equipment, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport and other related equipment. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a vessel, with
its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until they are firm and stable, and resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the
surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite. All of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are equipped with a
cantilever system that enables the rig to extend its drilling package over the aft end of the rig.







Fleet Enhancements and Additions:Diamond Offshore’s long
term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices, and otherwise by enhancing the capabilities of its existing rigs
at a lower cost and shortened construction period than newbuild construction would require. Since 2009, commencing with the acquisition of two newbuild, ultra-deepwater semisubmersible rigs, Diamond Offshore has committed over $5.0 billion towards
upgrading its fleet. In late 2014, Diamond Offshore took delivery of two ultra-deepwater drillships, theOcean BlackHornetand theOcean BlackRhino,which are expected to commence drilling operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico
(“GOM”) in the second quarter of 2015. Construction of theOcean Apex,a semisubmersible, was completed late in the fourth quarter of 2014, and the rig is currently operating under a one-well contract in Vietnam. Diamond Offshore
also has two other construction projects underway including:



—a dynamically positioned, ultra-deepwater drillship with an expected completion date in the first quarter of 2015 at an estimated cost of
approximately $655 million;



—a dynamically positioned, ultra-deepwater harsh environment semisubmersible drilling rig with an expected completion date in the first quarter of
2016 at an estimated cost of approximately $764 million.

Diamond Offshore will evaluate further rig
acquisition and enhancement opportunities as they arise. However, Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or enhancements to its fleet.

Markets:The principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the following:



—South America, principally offshore Brazil and Trinidad and Tobago;



—Australia and Southeast Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam;



—the Middle East;



—Europe, principally in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Norway;



—East and West Africa;



—the Mediterranean; and



—the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world.

Drilling Contracts:Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide
offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct
negotiations. Drilling contracts generally provide for a basic fixed dayrate regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being
moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig, including wages
and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to
earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance.

The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is
generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts
may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the
control of either party to the contract.







Certain of Diamond Offshore’s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice, and in most circumstances, this requires the payment of an early
termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually
agreeable terms at the time of the extension.

Customers:Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling
services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2014, 2013 and 2012, Diamond Offshore performed services for 35, 39 and 35 different customers. During 2014, 2013 and
2012, one of Diamond Offshore’s customers in Brazil, Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government), accounted for 32%, 34% and 33% of
Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues. OGX Petróleo e Gás Ltda., (a privately owned Brazilian oil and natural gas company that filed for bankruptcy in October of 2013), accounted for 2% and 12% of Diamond
Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2014, 2013 or 2012.

Diamond Offshore has six rigs currently contracted offshore Brazil and all four of its newbuild drillships are currently
operating, or expected to begin operations, during 2015 in the GOM. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore Brazil is $607 million, $395 million, $332 million and $159 million for the years 2015,
2016, 2017 and 2018. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations in the GOM is $505 million, $523 million and $653 million for the years 2015, 2016 and 2017 and $1.2 billion in the aggregate for the years 2018 to
2020 attributable to four customers.

Competition:Despite consolidation in previous years, the offshore
contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The industry may also experience additional consolidation in the future, which could create
other large competitors. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have approximately 800 mobile
drilling rigs, including approximately 300 floater rigs, marketed worldwide.

The offshore contract drilling industry is
influenced by a number of factors, including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and
the availability of drilling rigs.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is
typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability
of equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Diamond Offshore competes on
a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a cost that may be substantial,
from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore contract drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. Significant new rig construction and
upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition.

Governmental
Regulation:Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the
discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or
energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S.
accounted for approximately 85%, 89% and 94% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.







Properties:Diamond Offshore owns an office building in
Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located, offices and other facilities in New Iberia, Louisiana, Aberdeen, Scotland, Macae, Brazil and Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office,
warehouse and storage facilities in Australia, Egypt, Indonesia, Louisiana, Malaysia, Romania, Singapore, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, the U.K. and Vietnam to support its offshore drilling operations.

BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids
(“NGLs”) transportation and storage and natural gas gathering and processing. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 8.6%, 8.4% and 8.4% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012.

We own approximately 53% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of 125,586,133 common units and a 2% general partner interest. A
wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights which entitle the general partner to an increasing percentage of
the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and
operates approximately 14,190 miles of interconnected natural gas pipelines directly serving customers in 13 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States through numerous interconnections with
unaffiliated pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns approximately 435 miles of NGL pipelines in Louisiana and Texas. In 2014, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of natural gas and approximately
34.4 million barrels (“MMBbls”) of NGLs. Average daily throughput on Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline systems during 2014 was approximately 6.9 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas
storage facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 208.0 Bcf and Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL storage facilities consist of eight salt dome storage caverns
located in Louisiana with an aggregate storage capacity of approximately 17.6 MMBbls. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns three salt dome caverns and a brine pond for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGL storage operations.

The pipeline and storage systems of Boardwalk Pipeline consist of the following:

The Gulf South pipeline system runs approximately 7,400 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 7.0 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 2.9 Bcf per day. In October of 2014, Gulf South placed into service
its Southeast Market Expansion, adding approximately 0.5 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity. Gulf South has ten natural gas storage facilities with 83.5 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. Gulf South also owns and operates eight salt
dome natural gas storage caverns in Mississippi, with 45.5 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 28.6 Bcf is working gas capacity, and owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to five additional storage caverns.

The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East Texas and Arkansas and runs for approximately 6,060 miles north
and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 4.5 Bcf per day and average daily throughput
for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 2.7 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.3 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.

The Gulf Crossing pipeline system, which originates in Texas and proceeds into Louisiana, operates approximately 375 miles of
natural gas pipeline. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.9 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 1.2 Bcf per day.

Louisiana Midstream’s storage services provide approximately 61.5 MMBbls of salt dome storage capacity, including
approximately 11.2 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity and approximately 17.6 MMBbls of salt dome NGL storage capacity, significant brine supply infrastructure including three salt dome caverns and approximately 270 miles of pipeline assets,
including an extensive ethylene distribution system. Throughput was 33.8 MMBbls for the year ended December 31, 2014.







Boardwalk Petrochemical owns and operates the Evangeline Pipeline
(“Evangeline”), which is an approximately 180 mile interstate pipeline that, when fully operational, is expected to be capable of transporting approximately 2.6 billion pounds of ethylene per year between Texas and Louisiana, where it
interconnects with Louisiana Midstream’s ethylene distribution system. Boardwalk Pipeline acquired Evangeline in October of 2014. Throughput for the 2014 period since acquisition was 0.6 MMBbls.

Boardwalk Field Services operates natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing infrastructure primarily in
south Texas with approximately 340 miles of pipeline.

Boardwalk Pipeline is currently engaged in the following growth
projects. With the exception of the Sulphur Storage and Pipeline Expansion project, these projects remain subject to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulatory approval. See Liquidity and Capital Resources – Boardwalk
Pipeline for further discussion of capital expenditures and financing.

Ohio to Louisiana Access Project: This
project will provide long term firm natural gas transportation primarily from the Marcellus and Utica production areas to Louisiana, and while not creating additional capacity, would make a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s Texas Gas system
bi-directional. The project is supported by firm transportation contracts with producers and end-users and has a weighted average contract life of approximately 13 years. The project is expected to be placed into service in the first half of 2016.

Southern Indiana Market Lateral Project: This project, subject to one of the customer’s final board approval,
will consist of the construction of approximately 30 miles of pipeline from Indiana to Kentucky, adding approximately 0.2 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity to Boardwalk Pipeline’s Texas Gas system. The project is expected to be
placed into service in the second half of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years.

Western Kentucky
Market Lateral Project: This project would construct a pipeline lateral to provide deliveries to a proposed new power plant in Western Kentucky, adding approximately 0.2 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity to Boardwalk Pipeline’s
Texas Gas system. The project is expected to be placed into service in the second half of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years.

Power Plant Project in South Texas: In 2015, Boardwalk Pipeline executed a precedent agreement with a foundation shipper
for a project which consists of the addition of compression facilities and modifications of existing facilities to increase the operating capacity of certain sections of the Gulf South pipeline, providing transportation services of 0.2 Bcf per day
to a new power plant in South Texas. The project is expected to be placed into service in the second half of 2016, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years.

Sulphur Storage and Pipeline Expansion Project: In 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline executed a long term agreement to provide
transportation and storage services to support the development of a new ethane cracker plant in Louisiana. The project would involve significant storage and infrastructure development to serve petrochemical customers near Boardwalk Pipeline’s
Sulphur Hub and is expected to be placed into service in the second half of 2017.

Northern Supply Access
Project: This project will increase the peak-day transmission capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s Texas Gas system by the addition of compression facilities and other system modifications to make a portion of the system bi-directional and is
supported by precedent agreements for 0.3 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity. The project is expected to be placed into service in the second half of 2017, with a weighted-average contract life of 16 years.

Coastal Bend Header Project: In 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline executed precedent agreements with foundation shippers to
transport approximately 1.4 Bcf per day of natural gas to serve a planned liquefaction terminal in Freeport, Texas. This project will consist of the construction of an approximately 65-mile pipeline supply header to serve the terminal as well as
expansion and modifications to existing Gulf South pipeline facilities that will provide access to additional supply sources. The project is expected to be placed into service in 2018, with a weighted-average contract life of 20 years.







Customers:Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers,
including producers of natural gas, local distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines, located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.

Competition:Boardwalk Pipeline competes with numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage
and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to natural gas supply sources that are closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas. In addition,
regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional customers. As a result of regulators’ policies, capacity
segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk
Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources.

The principal elements of
competition among pipelines are availability of capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular flexibility, terms of service and
reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas
by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems, such as modifying them to allow for bi-directional flows, to meet the demands of customers, such as power generators and industrial users, and is continually reviewing its services and terms of
service to offer customers enhanced service options.

Seasonality:Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues
can be affected by weather, natural gas price levels, gas price differentials between locations on its pipeline systems (basis spreads), gas price differentials between time periods, such as winter to summer (time period price spreads) and natural
gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. Colder than normal
winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While
traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues. In 2014, approximately
54% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenue was recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

Governmental
Regulation:

In October of 2014, Boardwalk Pipeline’s Gulf South subsidiary filed a rate case with the FERC pursuant to Section 4
of the NGA (Docket No. RP 15-65), in which Gulf South is requesting, among other things, a reconfiguration of the transportation rate zones on its system and, in general, an increase in its tariff rates. The new tariff rates are expected to become
effective May 1, 2015, subject to refund, which means that Boardwalk Pipeline will be responsible for refunds if the FERC later finds that its proposed rates are not just and reasonable. Since the rate case is in the initial stages, the
ultimate outcome and impacts on Boardwalk Pipeline’s earnings and cash flows for 2015 and beyond cannot be predicted at this time.







The Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), also a division of the DOT, has authority to
regulate the rates Boardwalk Pipeline charges for service on its ethylene pipelines. The STB requires that Boardwalk Pipeline’s transportation rates be reasonable and that its practices cannot unreasonably discriminate among its ethylene
shippers.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and
regulations relating to protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal
of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases, discharges and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other
properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal
penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations. While Boardwalk Pipeline believes that they are in substantial compliance with
existing environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not materially affect them, there is no assurance that the current regulatory standards will not become more onerous in the future, resulting
in more significant costs to maintain compliance or increased exposure to significant liabilities.

Properties:Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 108,000 square feet of leased office space
located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also leases approximately 60,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky. Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial
portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents.







LOEWS HOTELS HOLDING CORPORATION

The subsidiaries of Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (collectively “Loews Hotels”), our wholly owned subsidiary,
presently operate a chain of 21 primarily upper, upscale hotels. Ten of these hotels are owned by Loews Hotels, eight are owned by joint ventures in which Loews Hotels has a significant equity interest and three are managed for unaffiliated owners.
Loews Hotels’ earnings are derived from the operation of its wholly owned hotels, its share of earnings in joint venture hotels and hotel management fees earned from both joint venture and managed hotels. Loews Hotels accounted for 3.3%, 2.6%
and 2.8% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012. The hotels are described below.

(b)The hotel has a land lease expiring in 2028 with an option to purchase the land.

(c)The hotel has a land lease expiring in 2036 with a renewal option for 24 years.

Competition:Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which Loews
Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are
located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on quality of location, facilities and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price and facilities as well as location and service. Because of the competitive
nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.







Recent Developments:



—In March of 2014, Universal’s Cabana Bay Beach Resort in Orlando, Florida opened a property in which Loews Hotels has a joint venture
interest;



—In July of 2014, Loews Hotels acquired a hotel in Chicago, Illinois, which is now operating as the Loews Chicago O’Hare Hotel;
