CNA FINANCIAL
CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated
in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA’s property and casualty insurance operations are conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), incorporated in 1897, and The Continental Insurance Company (“CIC”),
organized in 1853, and its affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation (“Continental”). CNA accounted for 60.0%, 58.9% and 69.1% of our consolidated total revenue for the
years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

CNA’s core businesses serves a wide variety of
customers, including small, medium and large businesses, associations, professionals and groups with a broad range of insurance and risk management products and services.

CNA’s insurance products primarily include commercial property and casualty coverages. CNA’s services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims
administration. CNA’s products and services are marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general agents.

CNA’s core business, commercial property and casualty insurance operations, is reported in two business segments: CNA Specialty and CNA Commercial. CNA’s non-core operations are managed in
two business segments: Life & Group Non-Core and Other Insurance. Each segment is managed separately due to differences in their product lines and markets.

CNA’s property and casualty field structure consists of 41 branch locations across the country organized into 6 zones. The centralized processing operation for small and
middle-market customers, located in Maitland, Florida, handles policy processing, billing and collection activities, and also acts as a call center to optimize customer service. The claims structure consists of a centralized claim center designed to
efficiently handle the high volume of low severity claims including property damage, liability, and workers’ compensation medical only claims, and 14 principal claim office locations around the country handling the more complex claims.

agencies. CNA Specialty
provides solutions for managing the risks of its clients, including architects, lawyers, accountants, healthcare professionals, financial intermediaries and public and private companies. Product offerings also include surety and fidelity bonds and
vehicle warranty services.

CNA Specialty includes the following business groups:

Professional & Management Liability:  Professional & Management liability provides
management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages, primarily in the United States. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms,
including architects, realtors, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and technology firms. Professional & Management Liability also provides Directors and Officers (“D&O”), employment practices, fiduciary and
fidelity coverages. Specific areas of focus include small and mid-size firms as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit organizations, where tailored products for this client segment are offered. Products within Professional &
Management Liability are distributed through brokers, agents and managing general underwriters.

Professional & Management Liability, through CNA HealthPro, also offers insurance products to serve the healthcare delivery system. Products include professional liability and associated standard property and casualty coverages,
and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer segments include long term care facilities, allied healthcare providers, life sciences, dental professionals and mid-size and large
healthcare facilities.

International:  International provides similar management and
professional liability insurance and other specialized property and casualty coverages in Canada and Europe.

Surety:  Surety consists primarily of CNA Surety Corporation (“CNA Surety”) and its insurance subsidiaries and offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. CNA Surety provides surety and
fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a combined network of independent agencies. CNA owns approximately 62% of CNA Surety.

Warranty and Alternative Risks:Warranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that protect individuals from the financial burden
associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles and portable electronic communication devices. These products are distributed through and administered by CNA’s wholly owned subsidiary, CNA National Warranty
Corporation, or through a third party administrator.

CNA Commercial

CNA Commercial works with an independent agency distribution system and a network of brokers to market a broad range of
property and casualty insurance products and services to small, middle-market and large businesses and organizations. Property products include standard and excess property coverages, as well as marine coverage, and boiler and machinery. Casualty
products include standard casualty insurance products such as workers’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also
offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs to those customers viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure.

These property and casualty products are offered as part of CNA’sCommercial, BusinessandInternationalinsurance groups. CNA’s Business insurance group serves its smaller
commercial accounts and the Commercial insurance group serves CNA’s middle markets and its larger risks. In addition, CNA Commercial provides total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial
insurance marketplace, through a wholly owned subsidiary, CNA ClaimPlus, Inc., a third party administrator. The International insurance group primarily consists of the commercial product lines of CNA’s operations in Europe, Canada, Latin
America and Hawaii.

Also included in CNA Commercial isCNA Select Risk (“Select Risk”),
which includes CNA’s excess and surplus lines coverages. Select Risk provides specialized insurance for selected commercial risks on both an individual customer and program basis. Customers insured by Select Risk are generally viewed as higher
risk and less predictable in exposure than those covered by standard insurance markets. Select Risk’s products are distributed throughout the United States through specialist producers, program agents and brokers.

Life & Group Non-Core

The Life & Group Non-Core segment primarily includes
the results of the life and group lines of business that are in run-off. CNA continues to service its existing individual long term care commitments, its payout annuity business and its pension deposit business. CNA also retains a block of group
reinsurance and life settlement contracts. These businesses are being managed as a run-off operation. CNA’s group long term care business, while considered non-core, continues to be actively marketed. During 2008, CNA exited the indexed group
annuity portion of its pension deposit business.

Other Insurance

Other Insurance includes certain CNA corporate expenses, including interest on CNA corporate debt, and the results of
certain property and casualty business primarily in run-off, including CNA Re. This segment also includes the results related to the centralized adjusting and settlement of asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&E”) claims.

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The following loss reserve
development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance companies. The
table excludes CNA’s life subsidiaries, and as such, the carried reserves will not agree to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated
year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally
recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last
section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.

Other

Competition:The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as
to rate and service. CNA competes with stock and mutual insurance companies, reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and customers. CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and
services.

Rates among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation. CNA competes
for business not only on the basis of rate, but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers, ratings and quality of service, including claim adjustment services.

There are approximately 2,400 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on
2008 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the thirteenth largest property and casualty insurance organization in the United States.

Regulation:The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision
throughout the United States. Each state has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of
statutory financial reports, and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly
discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in
relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the transfer or payment.

Insurers are
also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.
CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further, insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to
cover claims of insolvent insurers. Other insurance-related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation
second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process.

Reform of the U.S. tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance industry. Over the last decade, many states have passed some type of tort reform. Even though there has been some tort reform success, new causes of action and
theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. For example, some state legislatures are considering legislation
addressing direct actions against insurers related to bad faith claims. As a result of this unpredictability in the law, insurance underwriting and rating are expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and some
specialty coverages.

Although the federal government and its regulatory
agencies do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals; proposals addressing
natural catastrophe exposures; terrorism risk mechanisms; federal financial services reform; federal regulation of insurance; various tax proposals affecting insurance companies;

DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that are used in the drilling of offshore oil
and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Diamond Offshore owns 47 offshore rigs. Diamond Offshore accounted for 25.9%, 26.3% and 18.3% of our consolidated total revenue for the years
ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Diamond Offshore owns and operates 32 semisubmersible rigs,
consisting of 13 high specification and 19 intermediate rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position,
remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersible rigs are typically anchored in position and remain
stable for drilling in the semi-submerged floating position due in part to their wave transparency characteristics at the water line. Semisubmersible rigs can also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster
(“dynamic-positioning”) system to maintain the rig’s position over a drillsite. Five semisubmersible rigs in Diamond Offshore’s fleet have this capability.

Diamond Offshore’s high specification semisubmersible rigs are generally capable of working in water depths of 4,000 feet or
greater or in harsh environments and have other advanced features, as compared to intermediate semisubmersible rigs. As of January 25, 2010, seven of the 13 high specification semisubmersible rigs, including the recently acquiredOcean
Courage, were located in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”). At that date Diamond Offshore had two high specification semisubmersible rigs operating offshore Brazil, while a third was en route to Brazil from the GOM. Of







Item 1. Business

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. – (Continued)

Diamond Offshore’s remaining high specification semisubmersible rigs, one was located offshore each of Malaysia and Angola, while the final rig, theOcean Valor, was completing its commissioning in Singapore.

Diamond Offshore’s intermediate semisubmersible rigs generally work in maximum water depths up to 4,000 feet. As of
January 25, 2010, Diamond Offshore had 19 intermediate semisubmersible rigs in various locations around the world. Seven of these semisubmersible rigs were operating offshore Brazil and an eighth unit was en route to Brazil; three were located
in the North Sea; two each were located offshore Australia and offshore Mexico; one was located in the GOM and one offshore Vietnam. One unit was en route to the Falkland Islands, and the final intermediate semisubmersible rig, theOcean
Bounty, was in the process of being cold stacked in Malaysia.

Diamond Offshore has one high specification
drillship, theOcean Clipper,which was located offshore Brazil as of January 25, 2010. Drillships, which are typically self-propelled, are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a
dynamic-positioning system similar to those used on certain semisubmersible rigs. Deepwater drillships compete in many of the same markets as do high specification semisubmersible rigs.

Diamond Offshore has 14 jack-up drilling rigs. Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs
that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform. The rig hull includes the drilling rig, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid
materials, heliport and other related equipment. Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit of a particular rig is principally determined by the length of the rig’s
legs. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed
until resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite.

As of January 25, 2010, six of Diamond Offshore’s 14 jack-up rigs were located in the GOM and a
seventh rig, theOcean Scepter, was en route from Uruguay for a six-well drilling program in the GOM. Four of those rigs are independent-leg cantilevered units, two are mat-supported cantilevered units, and one is a mat-supported slot unit.
Diamond Offshore cold-stacked the three mat-supported jack-up rigs located in the GOM during the second quarter of 2009 and is no longer actively marketing these drilling units. Of Diamond Offshore’s seven remaining jack-up rigs, all of which
are independent-leg cantilevered units, two each were located offshore Egypt and Mexico, and one was located offshore each of Indonesia, Croatia and the Joint Petroleum Development Area between Australia and Timor Leste.

Diamond Offshore’s long-term strategy has been to economically upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced,
efficient, high-tech rigs, particularly deepwater semisubmersible rigs, in order to maximize the utilization of, and dayrates earned by, the rigs in its fleet. In addition, excluding Diamond Offshore’s two new deepwater floaters acquired in
2009, it has, since 1995, increased the number of its rigs capable of operating in 3,500 feet or more of water from three rigs to 14 (11 of which are high specification units), primarily by upgrading its existing fleet. Seven of these upgrades were
to Diamond Offshore’s Victory-class semisubmersible rigs, the design of which is well-suited for significant upgrade projects. Diamond Offshore has two additional Victory-class intermediate semisubmersible rigs that could potentially be
upgraded at some time in the future. During 2009, Diamond Offshore acquired two newbuild deepwater, semisubmersible, dynamically positioned drilling rigs, theOcean Courage(June 2009) and theOcean Valor(September 2009). TheOcean
Courageis completing its commissioning and preparing for its first contract in the GOM, which is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2010. Commissioning of theOcean Valoris expected to be completed in Singapore in the first
quarter of 2010.

Markets:The principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the following:



•the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico;



•South America, principally in Brazil;



•Europe, principally in the United Kingdom, or U.K., and Norway;



•the Mediterranean Basin, including Egypt;



•Africa, currently in Angola;



•Australia and Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam; and



•the Middle East, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world as the market demands.

Diamond Offshore believes its presence in multiple
markets is valuable in many respects. For example, Diamond Offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and other international areas in which Diamond Offshore operates,
while production experience it has gained through Brazilian and North Sea operations has potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond Offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market segment or area enables it to better
understand that customer’s needs and better serve that customer in different market segments or other geographic locations.

Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through competitive bidding, although it is not
unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding. Drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive
well. Drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond the control
of Diamond Offshore. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond
Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance.

A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or a group
of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed term, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract, and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling
operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party to the contract. In addition, certain of Diamond Offshore’s contracts
permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice, and in most circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the customer exercising
options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension.

Customers:Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and
independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2009, Diamond Offshore performed services for 47 different customers and for 49 different customers each during 2008 and 2007. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, one of Diamond
Offshore’s two customers in Brazil, Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras, (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government) accounted for 15%, 13% and 9% of Diamond Offshore’s annual
total consolidated revenues. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2009 and 2008, nor did any single customer account for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total
consolidated revenues during 2007.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. – (Continued)

Brazil is the most active floater market in the world today. The greatest concentration of Diamond Offshore’s operating assets outside the United States is offshore Brazil, where 12 rigs in its fleet
are either currently working or contracted to work during 2010. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore Brazil is $1.1 billion, $1.1 billion and $867.0 million for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012, and

Competition:The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The
drilling industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources
than Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have more than 600 mobile rigs available worldwide.

The offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors, including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas,
expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may
also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Governmental Regulation:Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to numerous
international, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some
circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 66%, 59% and 50% of its total consolidated
revenues for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Properties:Diamond Offshore
owns an eight-story office building containing approximately 182,000-net rentable square feet on approximately 6.2 acres of land located in Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters is located, two buildings totaling 39,000 square feet and 20
acres of land in New Iberia, Louisiana, for its offshore drilling warehouse and storage facility, a 13,000-square foot building and five acres of land in Aberdeen, Scotland, for its North Sea operations and two buildings totaling 65,000 square feet
and 11 acres of land in Macae, Brazil, for its South American operations. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Louisiana, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, the Netherlands, Malaysia,
Singapore, Egypt, Angola, Vietnam and Mexico to support its offshore drilling operations.

HIGHMOUNT
EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION LLC

HighMount is engaged in the exploration, production and marketing
of natural gas, NGLs (predominantly ethane and propane) and, to a small extent, oil, primarily in the Permian Basin in Texas, the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama. HighMount holds interests in developed and undeveloped
acreage, wellbores and well facilities, which generally take the form of working interests in leases that have varying terms. HighMount’s interests in these properties are, in many cases, held jointly with third parties and may be subject to
royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements with other parties as is customary in the oil and gas industry. HighMount also owns or has interests in gathering systems which
transport natural gas and NGLs, principally from its producing wells, to processing plants and pipelines owned by third parties. HighMount accounted for 4.4%, 5.8% and 2.1% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007.

HighMount Exploration & Production LLC – (Continued)

We use the following terms throughout this discussion of HighMount’s business, with “equivalent” volumes computed with oil and natural gas liquid (“NGL”) quantities converted to Mcf, on an energy equivalent ratio of
one barrel to six Mcf:





Average price-Average price during the twelve-month period, prior to the date of the estimate, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements with customers, excluding escalations based upon future conditions

Bbl-Barrel (of oil or NGLs)

Bcf-Billion cubic feet (of natural gas)

Bcfe-Billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Developed acreage-Acreage assignable to productive wells

Mcf-Thousand cubic feet (of natural gas)

Mcfe-Thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

MMBbl-Million barrels (of oil or NGLs)

MMBtu-Million British thermal units

MMcf-Million cubic feet (of natural gas)

MMcfe-Million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Productive wells-Producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production

Proved reserves-Quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations

Proved developed reserves-Proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment, infrastructure and operating
methods

Proved undeveloped reserves-Proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required

Tcf-Trillion cubic feet (of natural gas)

Tcfe-Trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Undeveloped acreage-Leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or

In addition, as used in this discussion of HighMount’s business, “gross
wells” refers to the total number of wells in which HighMount owns a working interest and “net wells” refers to the sum of each of the gross wells multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by HighMount in such well.
“Gross acres” refers to the total number of acres with respect to which HighMount owns or leases an interest and “net acres” is the sum of each unit of gross acres covered by a lease or other arrangement multiplied by
HighMount’s percentage mineral interest in such gross acreage.

As of December 31, 2009, HighMount
owned 2.0 Tcfe of net proved reserves, of which 80.5% were classified as proved developed reserves. HighMount’s estimated total proved reserves consist of 1.5 Tcf of natural gas, 70.1 MMBbls of NGLs, and 3.7 MMBbls of oil and condensate.
HighMount produced approximately 271 MMcfe per day of natural gas, NGLs and oil during 2009. HighMount holds leasehold or drilling rights in 1.0 million net acres, of which 0.6 million is developed acreage and the balance is held for
future exploration and development drilling opportunities. HighMount participated in the drilling of 159 wells during 2009, of which 154 (or 96.9%) are productive wells.

Reserves:HighMount’s reserves disclosed in this Report represent its share of reserves based on its net revenue interest in each property.
Estimated reserves as of December 31, 2009 are based upon studies for each of HighMount’s properties prepared by HighMount staff engineers. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by
the petroleum industry and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidelines.

HighMount implements various internal controls to assure objectivity of the reserve estimation process. The main internal controls include (a) detailed reviews of reserve-related information at various levels of the organization –
Asset Management, Division Management, Corporate Engineering and Executive Management, (b) reserve audit performed by an independent third party reserve auditor, (c) segregation of duties and (d) system reconciliation or automated
interface between various systems used in the reserve estimation process.







Item 1. Business

HighMount Exploration & Production LLC – (Continued)

HighMount employs a team of reservoir engineers that specialize in each of HighMount’s three basins. HighMount’s lead evaluator has over thirty years of oil and gas engineering experience,
twelve of those in the reservoir discipline and has a registered professional engineering license from the State of Oklahoma.

Ryder Scott Company, L.P., an independent third party petroleum engineering consulting firm, has audited HighMount’s reserve estimates in accordance with the “Standards Pertaining to the
Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Ryder Scott’s lead reservoir engineer responsible for the reserve audit has more than thirty years of experience in the field
of estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves and resources. He has the professional qualifications of a Reserve Estimator and a Reserve Auditor set forth in Article III of the “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil
and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame in 1975 and a Masters of Business Administration at the University
of Texas at Austin in 1998. He is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He is also a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, and the Houston’s Producers
Forum.

The following table sets forth HighMount’s proved reserves at December 31, 2009, based on
average 2009 prices of $3.87 per MMBtu for natural gas, $31.73 per Bbl for NGLs and $61.18 per Bbl for oil.

During 2009, natural gas
prices decreased significantly from their 2008 levels due largely to increased onshore natural gas production, plentiful levels of working gas in storage and reduced demand. At the same time, drilling costs remained relatively high during the first
and second quarter of 2009. The impact of these developments was a reduction of HighMount’s proved reserves by 181.1 Bcfe, that included a reduction of proved undeveloped reserves of 115.4 Bcfe. During 2009, HighMount converted 20.8 Bcfe from
proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves by drilling 63 gross proved undeveloped wells. HighMount spent $27 million to drill and complete these wells. During 2009, HighMount added 8.9 Bcfe to its proved undeveloped reserves as a
result of its development drilling.

Estimated net quantities of proved natural gas and oil (including
condensate and NGLs) reserves at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 and changes in the reserves during 2009, 2008 and 2007 are shown in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

HighMount’s properties typically have relatively long reserve lives, high well completion success rates and predictable
production profiles. Based on December 31, 2009 proved reserves and HighMount’s average production from these properties during 2009, the average reserve-to-production index of HighMount’s proved reserves is 20 years.

In order to replenish reserves as they are depleted by production, and to increase reserves, HighMount further develops its
existing acreage by drilling new wells and, where available, employing new technologies and drilling strategies designed to enhance production from existing wells. HighMount seeks to opportunistically acquire additional acreage in its core areas of
operation, as well as other locations where its management has identified an opportunity.

Production and
Sales:Please see the Production and Sales statistics table for additional information included under MD&A in Item 7.

HighMount utilizes its own marketing and sales personnel to market the natural gas and NGLs that it produces to large energy companies and intrastate pipelines and gathering companies. Production is
typically sold and delivered directly to a pipeline at liquid pooling points or at the tailgates of various processing plants, where it then enters a pipeline system. Permian Basin sales prices are primarily at a Houston Ship Channel Index, Antrim
sales are at a MichCon Index and Black Warrior sales are at a Southern Natural Gas Pipeline Index.

To manage
the risk of fluctuations in prevailing commodity prices, HighMount enters into commodity and basis swaps and other derivative instruments.







Item 1. Business

HighMount Exploration & Production LLC – (Continued)

Wells:As of December 31, 2009, HighMount had an interest in the following natural gas producing wells:



GrossNetPermian Basin5,8235,568Antrim Shale2,2581,004Black Warrior Basin1,4371,127Total producing wells9,5187,699

Wells located in the
Permian Basin have a typical well depth in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 feet, while wells located in the Antrim Shale and the Black Warrior Basin have typical well depths of 1,200 feet and 2,000 feet.

Competition:HighMount competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business, including
acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services. HighMount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and NGLs. Some of HighMount’s
competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds, available information about the property and standards
established by HighMount for minimum projected return on investment. Competition for sales of natural gas and NGLs is also presented by alternative fuel sources, including heating oil, imported liquefied natural gas and other fossil fuels.

Governmental Regulation:All of HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the
United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to
conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are
drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; and the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a
particular area); the unitization or pooling of properties; maximum rates of production from wells; venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production.

The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) to prohibit natural gas market manipulation by any entity, directed the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) to facilitate market transparency in the sale or transportation of physical natural gas and significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA of 1938, the NGA of 1978, or FERC regulations or orders
thereunder. In addition, HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and state agencies with respect to safety and operating conditions.

HighMount’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the
discharge of contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. In most instances, the regulatory
requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s operations may require it
to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non-hazardous oilfield wastes.
HighMount could be required, without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal, to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas or to perform remedial well plugging operations or
cleanups to prevent future contamination.

In September 2009, the United States Environmental Protection
Agency (“EPA”) adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by certain large U.S. GHG emitters. Affected companies were required to monitor their
GHG emissions starting January 1, 2010 and will be required to report to the EPA beginning in March 2011. Oil and gas exploration and production companies that emit less than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year from any facility (as defined in
the regulations), including HighMount, are not required to monitor or report emissions at this time. However, the EPA has indicated it will issue a proposed rule for

comment as it pertains to Oil and Gas Systems and HighMount anticipates that it will be required to begin data collection in 2011 for subsequent reporting to the EPA.

Properties:In addition to its interests in oil and gas producing properties, HighMount leases an aggregate of approximately 120,000 square feet of office space in
three locations in Houston, Texas, which includes its corporate headquarters, and approximately 102,000 square feet of office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and Traverse City, Michigan which is used in its operations. HighMount also leases other
surface rights and office, warehouse and storage facilities necessary to operate its business.

BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP
(“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 6.4%, 6.4% and 4.7% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and
2007.

As of February 19, 2010, we owned approximately 67% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of 104,219,466
common units, 22,866,667 class B units and a 2% general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours (“BPHC”) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights which entitle the general
partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates three interstate natural gas pipelines, with approximately 14,200 miles of interconnected pipelines, directly serving customers in 12 states and indirectly serving
customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. In 2009, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.1 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of gas. Average
daily throughput on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems during 2009 was approximately 5.7 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 11 underground storage fields located in
four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 163.0 Bcf.

Boardwalk Pipeline conducts all
of its operations through its three operating subsidiaries:

Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC (“Gulf
Crossing”):  The Gulf Crossing pipeline system, located in Texas and Louisiana, operates approximately 360 miles of natural gas pipeline. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.4 Bcf per day and average daily
throughput for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 0.7 Bcf per day. The designated peak-day transmission capacity is expected to increase to 1.7 Bcf per day from the addition of compression which is expected to be placed into service in the
first quarter of 2010.

Gulf South Pipeline Company, L.P. (“Gulf South”):  The Gulf South
pipeline system runs approximately 7,700 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Gulf South has two natural gas storage facilities with 83.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. The pipeline
system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 6.2 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2009 was 3.1 Bcf per day.

Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”):  The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East Texas and Arkansas and runs for approximately 6,110 miles north and east through
Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 4.3 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year
ended December 31, 2009 was 2.8 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields, of which it owns the majority of the working and base gas, with 80.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.

In 2008 and 2009, Boardwalk Pipeline completed its East Texas Pipeline, Southeast Expansion and Gulf Crossing Project
(“42-inch pipeline expansion projects”), which collectively consist of approximately 700 miles of 42-inch pipeline and certain related compression facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline also completed and placed in service its Fayetteville and
Greenville Laterals, which together consist of approximately 260 miles of 36-inch pipeline and certain related compression facilities. Additional compression was placed into service on the Fayetteville and Greenville Laterals in January of 2010 and
Boardwalk Pipeline expects to place into service additional compression on the Gulf Crossing Project in the first quarter of 2010. With the exception of the Greenville Lateral, these projects were designed to operate at higher than normal operating
pressures. While completing the requirements to operate Boardwalk Pipeline’s







Item 1. Business

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP – (Continued)

42-inch expansion project pipelines and the Fayetteville Lateral at higher than normal operating pressures in 2009, Boardwalk Pipeline discovered anomalies in certain pipeline segments on each of the projects, which resulted in reductions
of operating pressures on these pipelines below normal operating pressures and the shut down of segments of the pipelines for periods of time to remediate the anomalies, adversely impacting average daily throughput. Please see MD&A under
Item 7 for additional information. Boardwalk Pipeline is currently engaged in the Haynesville Project and Clarence Compression Project.

Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including marketers, local distribution companies, producers, electric power generators, intrastate and interstate pipelines and direct industrial users
located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.

Competition:

The natural gas industry has built, or is in the process of completing, significant new pipeline infrastructure that will support the development of unconventional natural gas supply basins across the
U.S. Additional pipeline infrastructure projects are being proposed. These new pipeline developments have increased competition in certain pipeline markets, resulting in lower price differentials between physical locations (basis spreads). Basis
spreads can impact the rates Boardwalk Pipeline will be able to negotiate with its customers when contracts come up for renewal. Despite these competitive conditions, assuming that customers use all of their reserved capacity, substantially all of
the operating capacity on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems is contracted for with a weighted-average contract life of approximately 5.9 years, although each year a portion of Boardwalk Pipeline’s capacity becomes subject to
re-contracting risk. For example, approximately 14.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s contracts are due to expire in 2010.

Seasonality:Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues can be affected by weather and natural gas price levels and volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power
generation, which in turn influences the short-term value of transportation and storage across its pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers
can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurred during the winter months driven by heating needs, the increased use of
natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has reduced the seasonality of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues over time. During 2009, approximately 55.0% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues were recognized in the first and fourth
quarters of the year.

Governmental Regulation:FERC regulates Boardwalk Pipeline’s
operating subsidiaries under the NGA of 1938 and the NGA of 1978. FERC regulates, among other things, the rates and charges for the transportation and storage of natural gas in interstate commerce and the extension, enlargement or abandonment of
facilities under its jurisdiction. Where required, Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries hold certificates of public convenience and necessity issued by FERC covering certain of its facilities, activities and services. The maximum rates
that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for gas transportation are established through FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. The maximum rates that may be charged by Boardwalk Pipeline for storage services on Texas Gas, with the
exception of approximately 8.3 Bcf of working gas capacity on that system, are also established through FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process. Key determinants in FERC’s cost-of-service rate-making process are the costs of providing
service, the allowed rate of







Item 1. Business

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP – (Continued)

return, throughput
assumptions, the allocation of costs, the capital structure and the rate design. FERC has authorized Gulf South to charge market-based rates for its firm and interruptible storage. Texas Gas is authorized to charge market-based rates for the firm
and ISS services associated with approximately 8.3 Bcf of its storage capacity. Texas Gas is prohibited from placing new rates into effect prior to November 1, 2010, and neither Gulf South nor Texas Gas has an obligation to file a new rate
case. Gulf Crossing will have to either file a rate case or justify its initial firm transportation rates by the end of the first quarter of 2012.

Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the DOT under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title I of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, which regulates safety requirements in the
design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline has received authority from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency of the DOT, to operate its
recently completed 42-inch pipeline expansion projects under special permits that will allow it to operate the pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (SMYS). Boardwalk
Pipeline is seeking authority from PHMSA to operate its Fayetteville Lateral at higher than normal operating pressures. Boardwalk Pipeline will need to operate each of these pipelines at higher than normal operating pressures in order to transport
all of the volumes it has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate these pipelines at higher pressures.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating
to protection of the environment. Such regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and
waste and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned
and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.

Under the EPA’s regulations
adopted in September of 2009, Boardwalk Pipeline was required, beginning in January of 2010, to monitor the GHG emissions from certain of its facilities, particularly compression stations, that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year and
must report on such emissions to the EPA beginning in March of 2011.

Properties:Boardwalk
Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 103,000 square feet of leased office space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also has approximately 108,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky in a building that it owns.
Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits,
licenses or consents.

Item 1. Business

Loews Hotels Holding Corporation – (Continued)

The
hotels owned by Loews Hotels are subject to mortgage indebtedness totaling approximately $224 million at December 31, 2009 with interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 6.3%, and maturing between 2010 and 2028. In addition, certain hotels are held
under leases which are subject to formula derived rental increases, with rentals aggregating approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on
general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and
service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service. Because of the competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and

In June of 2008, we disposed of our entire ownership interest in our wholly owned subsidiary, Lorillard, Inc.
(“Lorillard”), through the following two integrated transactions, collectively referred to as the “Separation”:



•On June 10, 2008, we distributed 108,478,429 shares, or approximately 62%, of the outstanding common stock of Lorillard in exchange for and in
redemption of all of the 108,478,429 outstanding shares of our former Carolina Group stock, in accordance with our Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the “Redemption”); and



•On June 16, 2008, we distributed the remaining 65,445,000 shares, or approximately 38%, of the outstanding common stock of Lorillard in
exchange for 93,492,857 shares of Loews common stock, reflecting an exchange ratio of 0.70 (the “Exchange Offer”).

As a result of the Separation, Lorillard is no longer a subsidiary of ours and we no longer own any interest in the outstanding stock of Lorillard. As of the completion of the Redemption, the former
Carolina Group and former Carolina Group stock have been eliminated. In addition, at that time all outstanding stock options and stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) awarded under our former Carolina Group 2002 Stock Option Plan were assumed
by Lorillard and converted into stock options and SARs which are exercisable for shares of Lorillard common stock.

The Loews common stock acquired by us in the Exchange Offer was recorded as a decrease in our Shareholders’ equity, reflecting Loews common stock at market value of the shares of Loews common stock delivered in the Exchange Offer. This
decline was offset by a $4.3 billion gain to us from the Exchange Offer, which was reported as a gain on disposal of the discontinued business.

Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been reclassified to reflect Lorillard as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses and cash flows have been
excluded from the respective captions in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, Consolidated Statements of Income, and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and have been included in Assets and Liabilities of discontinued operations, Discontinued
operations, net and Net cash flows - discontinued operations.

Prior to the Redemption, we had a two class
common stock structure: Loews common stock and former Carolina Group stock. Former Carolina Group stock, commonly called a tracking stock, was intended to reflect the performance of a defined group of Loews’s assets and liabilities
referred to as the former Carolina Group. The principal assets and liabilities attributable to the former Carolina Group were our 100% ownership of Lorillard, including all dividends paid by Lorillard to us, and any and all liabilities, costs and
expenses arising out of or relating to tobacco or tobacco-related businesses. Immediately prior to the Separation, outstanding former Carolina Group stock represented an approximately 62% economic interest in the performance of the former Carolina
Group. The Loews Group consisted of all of Loews’s assets and liabilities other than those allocated to the former Carolina Group, including an approximately 38% economic interest in the former Carolina Group.
