CNA FINANCIAL
CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated
in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA’s property and casualty and remaining life & group insurance operations are primarily conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), incorporated in 1897, and The
Continental Insurance Company (“CIC”), organized in 1853, and certain other affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation (“Continental”). CNA accounted for
65.6%, 63.4% and 63.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

CNA’s insurance products primarily include commercial property and casualty coverages, including surety. CNA’s services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims
administration. CNA’s products and services are primarily marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, insurance companies,
associations, professionals and other groups.

CNA’s property and casualty field structure consists of 49
underwriting locations across the United States. In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities, and also act as call centers to optimize service. The claims structure
consists of two regional claim centers designed to efficiently handle the high volume of low severity claims including property damage, liability, and workers’ compensation medical only claims, and 16 principal claim offices handling the more
complex claims. In addition, CNA has underwriting and claim capabilities in Canada and Europe.

CNA Specialty

CNA Specialty includes the following business groups:

Professional & Management Liability: Professional & Management Liability provides
management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages in the United States. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including
architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and technology firms. Professional & Management Liability also provides directors and officers (“D&O”), employment practices, fiduciary and
fidelity coverages. Specific areas of focus include small and mid-size firms as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit







organizations, where tailored products for this client segment are offered. Products within Professional & Management Liability are distributed through brokers, independent agents and
managing general underwriters. Professional & Management Liability, through CNA HealthPro, also offers insurance products to serve the health care industry. Products include professional liability and associated standard property and
casualty coverages, and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer segments include long term care facilities, allied health care providers, life sciences, dental
professionals and mid-size and large health care facilities.

International:  International
provides similar management and professional liability insurance and other specialized property and casualty coverages, through similar distribution channels, in Canada and Europe.

Surety:  Surety offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. CNA Surety provides
surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a network of independent agencies. On June 10, 2011, CNA completed the acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of CNA Surety.

contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles and portable electronic communication devices.

CNA Commercial

CNA Commercial’s property products include standard and excess property coverages, as well as marine coverage, and boiler and machinery. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products
such as workers’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs to
those customers viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure.

These property and casualty products
are offered as part of CNA’sSmall Business, CommercialandInternationalinsurance groups. CNA’s Small Business insurance group serves its smaller commercial accounts and the Commercial insurance group serves CNA’s
middle markets and its larger risks. In addition, CNA Commercial provides total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace, through a wholly owned subsidiary, CNA ClaimPlus,
Inc., a third party administrator. The International insurance group primarily consists of the commercial product lines of CNA’s operations in Europe and Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2011, CNA sold its 50% ownership interest in First
Insurance Company of Hawaii (“FICOH”).

Also included in CNA Commercial isCNA Select Risk
(“Select Risk”), which includes CNA’s excess and surplus lines coverages. Select Risk provides specialized insurance for selected commercial risks on both an individual customer and program basis. Customers insured by Select Risk
are generally viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure than those covered by standard insurance markets. Select Risk’s products are distributed throughout the United States through specialist producers, program agents and brokers.

Hardy

In July of 2012, CNA completed the acquisition of Hardy Underwriting Bermuda Limited (“Hardy”), a specialized Lloyd’s of London (“Lloyd’s”) underwriter. Through Lloyd’s
Syndicate 382, Hardy underwrites primarily short-tail exposures in the following coverages:Marine & Aviationprovides coverage for a variety of large risks including energy, cargo and specie, marine hull and general aviation.Non-Marine Propertycomprises direct and facultative property, including construction insurance of industrial and commercial risks (heavy industry, general manufacturing and commercial property portfolios), together with residential and small

including political violence, accident and health and financial institutions.







Life & Group Non-Core

Life & Group Non-Core primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business that are in
run-off. CNA continues to service its existing individual long term care commitments, its payout annuity business and its pension deposit business. CNA also retains a block of group reinsurance and life settlement contracts. These businesses are
being managed as a run-off operation. CNA’s group long term care business, while considered non-core, continues to accept new employees in existing groups.

Other

Other primarily includes certain CNA corporate
expenses, including interest on CNA corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”). In 2010, CNA ceded substantially all of its
legacy A&EP liabilities under the Loss Portfolio Transfer, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment
Expenses

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves
established for property and casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance companies. The table excludes CNA’s life insurance subsidiaries, and as
such, the carried reserves will not agree to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the
cumulative amounts paid as of the end of successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which
is the result of CNA’s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves
originally established, and indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.







The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending
balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. The development amounts in the table below include the impact of reinsurance commutations, but exclude the impact
of the allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables.

(a)Effective January 1, 2010, CNA ceded approximately $1.5 billion of net asbestos and environmental pollution claim and allocated claim
adjustment expense reserves relating to its continuing operations under a retroactive reinsurance agreement with an aggregate limit of $4.0 billion, as further discussed in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under
Item 8.

(b)On July 2, 2012, CNA acquired Hardy. As a result of this acquisition, net reserves were increased by $291 million. Further information on this
acquisition is included in Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.







Please read information relating to CNA’s property and casualty claim
and claim adjustment expense reserves and reserve development set forth under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”), and in Notes 1 and 8 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included under Item 8.

Investments

Please read Item 7, MD&A – Investments and Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included under Item 8.

Other

Competition:The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and
service. CNA competes with a large number of stock and mutual insurance companies and other entities for both distributors and customers. Insurers compete on the basis of factors including products, price, services, ratings and financial strength.
CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.

There are
approximately 2,800 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based on 2011 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the 13th largest property and casualty
insurance organization in the United States.

Regulation:The insurance industry is subject
to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision. Each domestic and foreign jurisdiction has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing
reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports, and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which
require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by insurance regulators,
depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance subsidiaries making the transfer or payment.

Hardy is also supervised by the Council of Lloyd’s, which is the franchisor for all Lloyd’s operations. The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate Lloyd’s
underwriting, such as establishing the capital requirements for syndicate participation. In addition, the annual business plans of each syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for
business planning and monitoring for all syndicates.

The European Union’s executive body, the European
Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called Solvency II that would apply to CNA’s European operations. In addition, global regulators, including the United States National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, are working with the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) to consider changes to insurance company supervision. Among the areas being addressed are company and group capital requirements, group
supervision and enterprise risk management. It is not currently clear to what extent or how the activities of the IAIS will impact CNA or U.S. insurance regulation.

Domestic insurers are also required by the state insurance regulators to provide coverage to insureds who would not
otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks. CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function
of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further, insurance
companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty fund assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers. Other insurance-related assessments are generally
levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis
and ratemaking process.







Although the federal government does not directly regulate the business of
insurance, federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals; proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures; terrorism risk
mechanisms; federal financial services reforms; various tax proposals affecting insurance companies; and possible regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions arising from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as
well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, both enacted in 2010.

Various legislative and
regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system have, and will continue to, impact CNA’s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages
continue to be proposed in state court actions or by federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. For example, some state legislatures have from time to time considered legislation addressing
direct actions against insurers related to bad faith claims. As a result of this unpredictability in the law, insurance underwriting is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and other specialty coverages.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act expanded the federal presence in insurance
oversight and may increase the regulatory requirements to which CNA may be subject. The Act’s requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance (property or casualty insurance placed from
insurers that are eligible to accept insurance, but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state). The Act also established a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The Act called for numerous studies
and contemplates further regulation.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related
amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act may increase CNA’s operating costs and underwriting losses. This landmark legislation may lead to numerous changes in the health care industry that could create additional operating
costs for CNA, particularly with respect to its workers’ compensation and long term care products.

Properties:The Chicago location houses CNA’s principal executive offices. CNA’s subsidiaries
own or lease office space in various cities throughout the United States and in other countries. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to CNA’s principal office locations:

DIAMOND OFFSHORE
DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”) is engaged, through its
subsidiaries, in the business of operating drilling rigs that are chartered on a contract basis for fixed terms by companies engaged in the exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated based on
market demand. Diamond Offshore accounted for 21.1%, 23.6% and 23.0% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Rigs:Diamond Offshore owns 44 offshore drilling rigs, consisting of 32 semisubmersible rigs, seven
jack-ups and five dynamically positioned drillships, four of which are under construction with deliveries scheduled for the second and fourth quarters of 2013 and the second and fourth quarters of 2014. Diamond Offshore’s semisubmersible fleet
also includes theOcean OnyxandOcean Apex, two moored semisubmersible rigs which are under construction and expected to be delivered in the third quarter of 2013 and the second quarter of 2014. Diamond Offshore’s diverse fleet
enables it to offer a broad range of services worldwide in both the floater market (ultra-deepwater, deepwater and mid-water) and the non-floater, or jack-up market.

A floater rig is a type of mobile offshore drilling unit that floats and does not rest on the seafloor. This asset class
includes self-propelled drillships and semisubmersible rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position,
remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersible rigs hold position while drilling by use of a series of
small propulsion units or thrusters that provide dynamic positioning (“DP”) to keep the rig on location, or with anchors tethered to the seabed. Although DP semisubmersibles are self-propelled, such rigs may be moved long distances with
the assistance of tug boats; non-DP, or moored, semisubmersible rigs require tug boats or the use of a heavy lift vessel to move between locations.

A drillship is an adaptation of a maritime vessel which is designed and constructed to carry out drilling operations by means of a substructure with a moon pool centrally located in the hull. Drillships
are typically self-propelled and are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a DP system similar to those used on semisubmersible rigs.

Diamond Offshore’s floater fleet (semisubmersibles and drillships) can be further categorized based on the nominal
water depth for each class of rig as follows:



CategoryRated Water Depth (a) (in feet)Number of Units in FleetUltra-Deepwater7,501   to   12,00012 (b)Deepwater5,000   to     7,5007 (c)Mid-Water400   to     4,99918 (d)



(a)Rated water depth for semisubmersibles and drillships reflects the maximum water depth in which a floating rig has been designed to operate.
However, individual rigs are capable of drilling, or have drilled, in marginally greater water depths depending on conditions (such as salinity of the ocean, weather and sea conditions).

(b)Includes four drillships under construction.

(c)Includes two rigs to be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of Diamond Offshore’s existing mid-water floaters.

(d)Includes three rigs which are being marketed for sale.

Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with legs that are lowered to the ocean floor.
Diamond Offshore’s jack-ups are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit of a particular rig is able to operate is principally determined by the length of the rig’s legs. The rig hull includes the
drilling equipment, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid materials, heliport and other related equipment. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a
vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed until they are firm and stable, and resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull
above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the







water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite. All of Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are equipped with a cantilever system that enables the rig to extend its
drilling package over the aft end of the rig.

Fleet Enhancements and
Additions:Diamond Offshore’s long term strategy is to upgrade its fleet to meet customer demand for advanced, efficient and high-tech rigs by acquiring or building new rigs when possible to do so at attractive prices, and
otherwise by enhancing the capabilities of its existing rigs at a lower cost and reduced construction period than newbuild construction would require. Diamond Offshore has contracted with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., for the construction of
four dynamically positioned, ultra-deepwater drillships. Diamond Offshore expects the aggregate cost for the four drillships, including commissioning, spares and project management costs, to be approximately $2.6 billion.

Construction has begun on two moored semisubmersible rigs designed to operate in water depths up to 6,000 feet. The rigs
will be constructed utilizing the hulls of two of Diamond Offshore’s mid-water floaters and the aggregate cost of the two rigs is estimated to be approximately $680 million, including commissioning, spares and project management costs.

In February of 2013, Diamond Offshore announced that one of its mid-water floaters, theOcean Patriot,
will undergo enhancements to enable the rig to work in the North Sea at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately $120 million. The enhancement project is expected to begin during the third quarter of 2013 with completion expected in early 2014.

Diamond Offshore will evaluate further rig acquisition and upgrade opportunities as they arise. However,
Diamond Offshore can provide no assurance whether, or to what extent, it will continue to make rig acquisitions or upgrades to its fleet.

Markets:The principal markets for Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the following:



—South America, principally offshore Brazil;



—Australia and Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam;



—the Middle East, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia;



—Europe, principally in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) and Norway;



—East and West Africa;



—the Mediterranean Basin, including Egypt; and



—the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world.

Diamond Offshore believes its presence in multiple markets is valuable in
many respects. For example, Diamond Offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and other international areas in which Diamond Offshore operates, while production
experience it has gained through its Brazilian and North Sea operations has potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond Offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market area enables it to better understand that
customer’s needs and better serve that customer in different market areas or other geographic locations.

Drilling Contracts:Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in
their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through a competitive bid process, although it is not unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts following direct negotiations. Drilling contracts
generally provide for a basic fixed dayrate regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive well. Drilling contracts may also provide for reductions in rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when







drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other circumstances. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays the
operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate
contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance.

The duration of a dayrate drilling contract is generally tied to the time required to drill a single well or a group of
wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed period of time, in what Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract. Many drilling contracts may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is
destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party to the contract. Certain of Diamond
Offshore’s contracts also permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice, and in most circumstances, this requires the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be
extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the extension.

Customers:Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes
major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, Diamond Offshore performed services for 35, 52 and 46 different customers. During 2012, 2011 and 2010, one of Diamond Offshore’s
customers in Brazil, Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (“Petrobras”), (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government), accounted for 33%, 35% and 24% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total
consolidated revenues. OGX Petróleo e Gás Ltda. (“OGX”), (a privately owned Brazilian oil and natural gas company), accounted for 12%, 14% and 14% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues in each of the
years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2012, 2011 or 2010.

Brazil is one of the most active floater markets in the world today. Currently, the greatest concentration of Diamond
Offshore’s operating assets is offshore Brazil, where it has 12 rigs contracted. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore Brazil is $1.2 billion, $1.0 billion, $0.5 billion and $62 million for
the years 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016.

Competition:Despite consolidation in recent
years, the offshore contract drilling industry remains highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The industry may also experience additional consolidation in the future,
which could create other large competitors. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have almost 780
mobile rigs available worldwide.

The offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of
factors, including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas, expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of
drilling rigs.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically
the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of
equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Diamond Offshore
competes on a worldwide basis, but competition may vary significantly by region at any particular time. Competition for offshore rigs generally takes place on a global basis, as these rigs are highly mobile and may be moved, at a cost that may be
substantial, from one region to another. It is characteristic of the offshore contract drilling industry to move rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates. Significant new rig
construction and upgrades of existing drilling units could also intensify price competition.







Governmental Regulation:Diamond Offshore’s
operations are subject to numerous international, foreign, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring
removal and clean-up under some circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for
approximately 94%, 90% and 81% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Properties:Diamond Offshore owns an office building in Houston, Texas, where its corporate headquarters are located, offices and other facilities in New Iberia, Louisiana,
Aberdeen, Scotland, Macae, Brazil and Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Louisiana, Australia, Indonesia, Norway, Malaysia, Singapore, Egypt, Equatorial
Guinea, Angola, Vietnam and the U.K. to support its offshore drilling operations.

BOARDWALK
PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in
integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) transportation and storage and natural gas gathering and processing. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 8.1%, 8.1% and 7.7% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

We own approximately 55% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of
102,719,466 common units, 22,866,667 class B units and a 2% general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours, Boardwalk Pipelines Holding Corp. (“BPHC”) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive
distribution rights which entitle the general partner to an increasing percentage of the cash that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

In October of 2012, Boardwalk Pipeline acquired Boardwalk Louisiana Midstream LLC (“Louisiana Midstream”) for
approximately $620 million. Louisiana Midstream provides transportation and storage services for natural gas and NGLs, fractionation services for NGLs and brine supply services for producers and consumers of petrochemicals through two hubs in
southern Louisiana.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns and operates approximately 14,170 miles of interconnected natural
gas pipelines directly serving customers in 13 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns
approximately 240 miles of NGL pipelines in Louisiana. In 2012, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of gas and approximately 7.1 million barrels (“MMbbls”) of NGLs. Average daily
throughput on Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline systems during 2012 was approximately 6.9 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 14 underground storage fields
located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately 201.0 Bcf and Boardwalk Pipeline’s NGL storage facilities consist of eight salt dome storage caverns located in one state with an aggregate storage capacity of
approximately 17.6 MMbbls. Boardwalk Pipeline also owns two salt dome caverns for use in providing brine supply services and to support the NGL cavern operations.

The pipeline and storage systems of Boardwalk Pipeline consist of the following:

The Gulf Crossing pipeline system, which originates in Texas and proceeds into Louisiana, operates approximately 360
miles of natural gas pipeline. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.7 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 1.3 Bcf per day.

The Gulf South pipeline system runs approximately 7,240 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Gulf South has two natural gas storage facilities with 83.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 6.8 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year
ended December 31, 2012 was 3.0 Bcf per day.







The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East Texas and
Arkansas and runs for approximately 6,110 miles north and east through Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery
capacity of 4.4 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 2.5 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields with 84.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.

Field Services operates natural gas gathering, compression, treating and processing infrastructure in southern Texas and
in the Marcellus Shale area in Pennsylvania with approximately 355 miles of pipeline.

Boardwalk HP Storage
Company, LLC (“HP Storage”) owns and operates seven salt dome natural gas storage caverns in Mississippi, with 36.3 Bcf of total storage capacity, of which approximately 23.0 Bcf is working gas capacity. HP Storage also operates
approximately 105 miles of pipeline which connects its facilities with several major natural gas pipelines, including Gulf South. Average daily throughput for the pipeline system for the year ended December 31, 2012 was 0.1 Bcf per day. HP
Storage also owns undeveloped land which is suitable for up to six additional storage caverns, one of which is expected to be placed in service in 2013.

Louisiana Midstream’s storage services provide approximately 53.2 MMbbls of salt dome storage capacity, including approximately 11.0 Bcf of working natural gas storage capacity and approximately 17.6
MMbbls of salt dome NGL storage capacity, significant brine supply infrastructure including two salt dome caverns and more than 240 miles of pipeline assets, including an extensive ethylene distribution system.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s current expansion projects include the following:

Southeast Market Expansion: The Southeast Market Expansion project is an interconnection between Boardwalk
Pipeline’s Gulf South pipeline and HP Storage facilities, additional compression facilities and approximately 70 miles of additional pipeline, adding 0.5 Bcf per day of peak-day transmission capacity, subject to Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (“FERC”) approval. The project is expected to be placed in service in the second half of 2014 and will cost approximately $300 million. The Southeast Market Expansion project is fully contracted with a weighted-average contract
life of approximately 10 years.

South Texas Eagle Ford Expansion: The South Texas Eagle Ford Expansion
construction project consists of 55 miles of gathering pipeline and a cryogenic processing plant. The system will have the capability of gathering in excess of 0.3 Bcf per day of liquids-rich gas in the Eagle Ford Shale production area in Texas and
processing up to 150 MMcf per day of liquids-rich gas. Boardwalk Pipeline will also provide re-delivery of processed residue gas to a number of interstate and intrastate pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline has executed long term fee-based gathering and
processing agreements for approximately 50% of the plant’s processing capacity. The plant and new pipeline are estimated to cost approximately $180 million and are expected to be placed in service in April of 2013.

Salt Dome Storage: HP Storage is developing a new salt dome storage cavern having working gas capacity of
approximately 5.3 Bcf, which is expected to be placed in service in the second quarter of 2013 with an estimated cost of approximately $23 million.

Choctaw Brine Supply Expansion Projects: Louisiana Midstream is engaged in two brine supply service expansion projects. The first brine supply project consists of the development of a one million
barrel brine pond, which was placed in service in January of 2013 at a total cost of approximately $13 million. Louisiana Midstream has executed seven-year, fixed-fee contracts in support of this project. The second project, which is supported by a
20-year commitment with minimum volume requirements, consists of constructing 26 miles of 12-inch pipeline from Louisiana Midstream’s facilities to a petrochemical customer’s plant. This project is expected to cost approximately $50
million and is expected to be placed in service in the third quarter of 2013.

Customers:Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including producers of natural gas,
local distribution companies, marketers, electric power generators, industrial users and interstate and intrastate pipelines, located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.







Competition:Boardwalk Pipeline competes with
numerous other pipelines that provide transportation, storage and other services at many locations along its pipeline systems. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with pipelines that are attached to new natural gas supply sources that are being
developed closer to some of its traditional natural gas market areas. In addition, regulators’ continuing efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk
Pipeline’s traditional customers. As a result of regulators’ policies, capacity segmentation and capacity release have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas pipeline
services. Further, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal, fuel oils and alternative fuel sources.

The principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity, rates, terms of service, access to gas
supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. In many cases, the elements of competition, in particular flexibility, terms of service and reliability, are key differentiating factors between competitors. This is especially the case with capacity
being sold on a longer term basis. Boardwalk Pipeline is focused on finding opportunities to enhance its competitive profile in these areas by increasing the flexibility of its pipeline systems to meet the demands of customers, such as power
generators and industrial users, and is continually reviewing its services and terms of service to offer customers enhanced service options.

Seasonality:Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues can be affected by weather, natural gas price levels and natural gas price volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for
heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for
heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months
driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues. In 2012, approximately 53% of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenue was recognized in the first and
fourth quarters of the year.

Governmental Regulation:

Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) under the Natural Gas
Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title I of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (“NGPSA”) and the Hazardous Liquids Pipeline Safety Act of 1979 (“HLPSA”), which regulates safety requirements in the design, construction,
operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas and NGL pipeline facilities. Boardwalk Pipeline has received authority from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency of DOT, to operate certain
natural gas pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified Minimum Yield Strength (“SMYS”). Operating at higher than
normal operating pressures will allow each of these pipelines to transport all of the volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate
these natural gas pipeline assets at higher pressures. PHMSA has also developed regulations that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs to comprehensively evaluate certain areas along their pipelines and
take additional measures to protect pipeline







segments located in highly populated areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Act”) was enacted in 2012 and increased maximum civil
penalties for certain violations to $200,000 per violation per day, and from a total cap of $1 million to $2 million. In addition, the 2011 Act reauthorized the federal pipeline safety programs of PHMSA through September 30, 2015, and directs
the Secretary of Transportation to undertake a number of reviews, studies and reports, some of which may result in additional natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline safety rulemaking. A number of the provisions of the 2011 Act have the potential
to cause owners and operators of pipeline facilities to incur significant capital expenditures and/or operating costs.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment. Such regulations impose, among other things,
restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances
into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties be operated, maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.

Properties:Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately 108,000 square feet of leased office
space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also leases approximately 108,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky. Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However,
substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents.

HIGHMOUNT EXPLORATION & PRODUCTION LLC

HighMount Exploration & Production, LLC (“HighMount”) is engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of natural gas and oil (including condensate and NGLs). HighMount accounted
for 2.0%, 2.5% and 2.9% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010.

HighMount’s proved reserves and production are primarily located in the Sonora field, a tight sands gas formation within the Permian Basin in West Texas. HighMount holds mineral rights on over
500,000 net acres in the Permian Basin, with over 6,000 producing wells. In addition, HighMount has working interests in undeveloped oil and gas properties located on approximately 73,000 net acres in Oklahoma and approximately 9,000 net acres in
the Texas Panhandle which contain primarily oil reserves. During 2012, HighMount began the commercial development of its Oklahoma properties, utilizing horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing technologies.

HighMount’s interests in developed and undeveloped acreage, wellbores and well facilities generally take the form of
working interests in leases that have varying terms. HighMount’s interests in these properties are, in many cases, held jointly with third parties and may be subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits and other similar
interests and contractual arrangements with other parties as is customary in the oil and gas industry. HighMount also owns and operates approximately 3,000 miles of gathering lines and over 65,000 horsepower of compression which are used to
transport natural gas and NGLs principally from HighMount’s producing wells to processing plants and pipelines owned by third parties.







We use the following terms throughout this discussion of HighMount’s
business, with “equivalent” volumes computed with oil and NGL quantities converted to Mcf, on an energy equivalent ratio of one barrel to six Mcf:





Average price-Average price during the twelve-month period, prior to the date of the estimate, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month

As of December 31, 2012, HighMount owned 825.1 Bcfe of net proved reserves, of which
84.1% were classified as proved developed reserves. HighMount’s estimated total proved reserves consist of 557.6 Bcf of natural gas, 35.1 MMBbls of NGLs, and 9.5 MMBbls of oil and condensate. HighMount produced approximately 154 MMcfe per day
of net natural gas, NGLs and oil during 2012. HighMount holds leasehold or drilling rights in 0.7 million net acres, of which 0.5 million is developed acreage and the balance is held for future exploration and development drilling
opportunities. HighMount participated in the drilling of 91 wells during 2012, of which 83 (or 91.2%) are productive wells.

Reserves:HighMount’s reserves represent its share of reserves based on its net revenue interest in each property. Estimated reserves as of December 31, 2012 are
based upon studies for each of HighMount’s properties prepared by HighMount staff engineers and are the responsibility of management. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the
petroleum industry and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) guidelines.







HighMount employs various internal controls to validate the reserve
estimation process. The main internal controls include (i) detailed reviews of reserve-related information by reserve engineering and executive management, (ii) reserve audits performed by an independent third party reserve auditor,
(iii) segregation of duties, and (iv) system reconciliation or automated interface between various systems used in the reserve estimation process.

HighMount employs a team of reservoir engineers that specialize in HighMount’s areas of operation. The reservoir engineering team reports to HighMount’s Chief Operating Officer. The compensation
of HighMount’s reservoir engineers is not dependent on the quantity of reserves booked. HighMount also employs a lead evaluator who reports to the Chief Financial Officer. HighMount’s lead evaluator has over 33 years of petroleum
engineering experience, most of which have been in the reservoir engineering and reserve fields. He is a member in good standing of the Society of Petroleum Evaluation Engineers and the Society of Petroleum Engineers, as well as a Licensed
Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.

HighMount’s reserves estimates for 2012 have been
independently audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), a worldwide leader of petroleum property analysis for industry and financial organizations and governmental agencies. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs
consulting services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. The technical person primarily responsible for NSAI’s audit and audit letter has 32 years of industry experience and has been practicing consulting
petroleum engineering at NSAI since 1989.

The following table sets forth HighMount’s proved reserves at
December 31, 2012, based on average 2012 prices of $2.76 per MMBtu for natural gas, $41.11 per Bbl for NGLs and $94.71 per Bbl for oil. Approximately 95% of HighMount’s proved reserves were located in the Permian Basin in Texas and
approximately 5% of proved reserves were located in Oklahoma.

HighMount reviews its proved reserves on an annual basis. During 2012, total proved
reserves declined 309 Bcfe, reflecting (i) a 328 Bcfe reduction as a result of economic factors such as lower gas prices and higher operating expenses, and as a result of higher production decline rates of its producing wells, partly due to the
suspension of uneconomic maintenance and recompletion work, (ii) a 56 Bcfe reduction as a result of production during the year, offset by (iii) additions of 75 Bcfe through drilling and booking of proved undeveloped locations.

At December 31, 2012, HighMount had proved undeveloped reserves of 131 Bcfe on locations scheduled to be drilled in
the next five years. During 2012, HighMount recorded negative net reserve revisions of 198 Bcfe primarily due to a reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to the non-proved category because these reserves were no longer economical due to the
decrease in natural gas prices. Also, 48 Bcfe of non-proved reserves were promoted to the proved undeveloped category as a result of the 2012 drilling activity. During 2012, HighMount spent $14 million to convert 2 Bcfe from proved undeveloped
reserves to proved developed reserves through drilling. As of December 31, 2012, there were no proved undeveloped locations that had remained undeveloped for five years or more.

Estimated net quantities of proved natural gas and oil reserves at December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 and changes in
the reserves during 2012, 2011 and 2010 are shown in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

HighMount’s Sonora properties typically have relatively long reserve lives and high well completion success rates. Based on December 31, 2012 proved reserves and HighMount’s average
production from these properties during 2012, the average reserve-to-production index of HighMount’s proved reserves is 15 years.







In order to replenish reserves as they are depleted by production, and to
increase reserves, HighMount develops its existing acreage by drilling new wells and, where available, employing new technologies and drilling strategies designed to enhance production from existing wells. In addition, HighMount seeks to acquire
additional acreage in its core areas of operation, as well as other locations where its management has identified an opportunity.

During 2012, 2011 and 2010, HighMount engaged in the drilling activity presented in the following table:

In addition, at December 31, 2012, HighMount had 23 (20.2 net) wells in progress.

Acreage:As of December 31, 2012, HighMount owned interests in 1,107,551 gross
(700,281 net) acres in the United States which is comprised of 609,659 gross (467,602 net) developed acres, and 497,892 gross (232,679 net) undeveloped acres.

As of December 31, 2012, leases covering 86,577, 27,859 and 9,843 of HighMount’s net acreage will expire by December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, if production is not established or HighMount
takes no other action to extend the terms.

Production and Sales:Please see the Production
and Sales statistics table for additional information included in the MD&A under Item 7.

HighMount
utilizes its own marketing and sales personnel to market the natural gas and oil that it produces to large energy companies and intrastate pipelines and gathering companies. Production is typically sold and delivered directly to a pipeline at liquid
pooling points or at the tailgates of various processing plants, where it then enters a pipeline system. Permian Basin natural gas sales prices are primarily at a Houston Ship Channel Index.

To manage the risk of fluctuations in prevailing commodity prices, HighMount enters into commodity and basis swaps and
other derivative instruments.

Wells:As of December 31, 2012, HighMount had working
interests in 6,133 gross producing wells (5,874 net producing wells) located primarily in the Permian Basin. In addition, HighMount had royalty interests in approximately 250 wells located in the Permian Basin. Wells located in the Permian Basin
have a typical well depth in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 feet.

Competition:HighMount
competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business, including acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services. HighMount also competes
in the marketing of produced natural gas and oil. Some of HighMount’s competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire producing properties include
available funds, available information about the property and standards established by HighMount for minimum projected return on investment. Natural gas and oil also compete with alternative fuel sources, including heating oil and coal.







Governmental Regulation:All of HighMount’s
operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among
other things: permits to drill and to conduct other operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and
restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the
density of wells which may be drilled in a particular area); the unitization or pooling of natural gas and oil properties; maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells; venting or flaring of natural gas; and the ratability of
production and the operation of gathering systems and related assets.

HighMount uses hydraulic fracturing to
stimulate the production of oil and natural gas. In recent years, concerns have been raised that the fracturing process may, among other things, contaminate underground sources of drinking water. The conference committee report for The Department of
the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 requested the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) to conduct a study of hydraulic fracturing, particularly the relationship between
hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. In December of 2012 the EPA issued a progress report of the projects the EPA is conducting as part of the study. A final draft report is expected to be released for public comment and peer review in 2014.
Several bills have been introduced in Congress seeking federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, which has historically been regulated at the state level, though none of the proposed legislation has been passed into law. HighMount believes that
similar bills will continue to be introduced in Congress and a number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing; however, HighMount cannot predict
whether any such bill will be passed into law or, if passed, the substance of any such new law.

The Federal
Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA to prohibit natural gas market manipulation by any entity, directed the FERC to facilitate market transparency in the sale or transportation of physical natural gas and significantly increased the penalties
for violations of the NGA of 1938, the NGPA of 1978, or FERC regulations or orders thereunder. In addition, HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the DOT and state agencies with respect to
safety and operating conditions.

HighMount’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local
laws and regulations concerning the discharge of contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. In most
instances, the regulatory requirements relate to the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s
operations may require it to obtain permits for, among other things, air emissions, discharges into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other
non-hazardous oilfield wastes. HighMount could be required, without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal, to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas or to perform
remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to prevent future contamination.

In September of 2009, the EPA
adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by certain large U.S. GHG emitters. Affected companies are required to monitor their GHG emissions and report to
the EPA. Oil and gas exploration and production companies that emit more than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year from any facility (as defined in the regulations), including HighMount, are required to monitor and report emissions for facilities that
meet the emissions threshold. HighMount filed its first GHG report in September of 2012 for the 2011 reporting year.

Properties:In addition to its interests in oil and gas producing properties, HighMount leases an aggregate of approximately 56,300 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas, which
includes its corporate headquarters, and approximately 83,800 square feet of office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. HighMount also leases other surface rights and office, warehouse and storage facilities necessary to operate its business. In
addition to leased properties, HighMount also owns a 44,000 square foot office building in Sonora, Texas, and a 1,500 square foot office building in Morrison, Oklahoma.

Competition:Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous
in all areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations
other than those in which its hotels are located. Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service. Because of the
competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.
