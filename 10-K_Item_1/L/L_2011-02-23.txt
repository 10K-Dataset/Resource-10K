CNA FINANCIAL
CORPORATION

CNA Financial Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, “CNA”) was incorporated
in 1967 and is an insurance holding company. CNA’s property and casualty insurance operations are conducted by Continental Casualty Company (“CCC”), incorporated in 1897, and The Continental Insurance Company (“CIC”),
organized in 1853, and certain other affiliates. CIC became a subsidiary of CNA in 1995 as a result of the acquisition of The Continental Corporation (“Continental”). CNA accounted for 63.0%, 60.0% and 58.9% of our consolidated total
revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

CNA’s insurance products primarily
include commercial property and casualty coverages. CNA’s services include risk management, information services, warranty and claims administration. CNA’s products and services are marketed through independent agents, brokers and managing
general underwriters to a wide variety of customers, including small, medium and large businesses, associations, professionals and other groups.

CNA’s core business, commercial property and casualty insurance operations, is reported in two business segments: CNA Specialty and CNA Commercial. CNA’s non-core businesses are managed in
two business segments: Life & Group Non-Core and Other Insurance. Each segment is managed separately due to differences in their product lines and markets.

CNA’s property and casualty field structure consists of 44 underwriting locations across the country. There are
three centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities, and also act as call centers to optimize service. The claims structure consists of a centralized claim center designed to efficiently handle
the high volume of low severity claims including property damage, liability, and workers’ compensation medical only claims, and 15 principal claim office locations around the country handling the more complex claims.

CNA Specialty

CNA Specialty provides professional liability and other coverages through property and casualty products and services, both domestically and abroad, through a network of brokers, independent agencies and
managing general underwriters. CNA Specialty provides solutions for managing the risks of its clients, including architects, lawyers, accountants, health care professionals, financial intermediaries and public and private companies. Product
offerings also include surety and fidelity bonds and vehicle warranty services.







CNA Specialty includes the following business groups:

Professional & Management Liability: Professional & Management Liability provides
management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages in the United States. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including
architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and technology firms. Professional & Management Liability also provides directors and officers, employment practices, fiduciary and fidelity coverages. Specific
areas of focus include small and mid-size firms as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit organizations, where tailored products for this client segment are offered. Products within Professional & Management Liability are
distributed through brokers, agents and managing general underwriters. Professional & Management Liability, through CNA HealthPro, also offers insurance products to serve the health care delivery system. Products include professional
liability and associated standard property and casualty coverages, and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer segments include long term care facilities, allied health care
providers, life sciences, dental professionals and mid-size and large health care facilities.

International: International provides similar management and professional liability insurance and other
specialized property and casualty coverages in Canada and Europe.

Surety: Surety consists
primarily of CNA Surety Corporation (“CNA Surety”) and its insurance subsidiaries and offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. CNA Surety provides surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a combined
network of independent agencies. CNA owns approximately 61% of CNA Surety.

Warranty and Alternative
Risks:Warranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles
and portable electronic communication devices. These products are distributed through and administered by CNA’s wholly owned subsidiary, CNA National Warranty Corporation, or through third party administrators.

CNA Commercial

CNA Commercial works with an independent agency distribution system and a network of brokers to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products and services to small, middle-market and
large businesses and organizations domestically and abroad. Property products include standard and excess property coverages, as well as marine coverage, and boiler and machinery. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products such
as workers’ compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, CNA also offers specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs to those
customers viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure.

These property and casualty products are
offered as part of CNA’sBusiness, CommercialandInternationalinsurance groups. CNA’s Business insurance group serves its smaller commercial accounts and the Commercial insurance group serves CNA’s middle markets and
its larger risks. In addition, CNA Commercial provides total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace, through a wholly owned subsidiary, CNA ClaimPlus, Inc., a third party
administrator. The International insurance group primarily consists of the commercial product lines of CNA’s operations in Europe, Canada, as well as Hawaii.

Also included in CNA Commercial isCNA Select Risk (“Select Risk”), which includes CNA’s excess and
surplus lines coverages. Select Risk provides specialized insurance for selected commercial risks on both an individual customer and program basis. Customers insured by Select Risk are generally viewed as higher risk and less predictable in exposure
than those covered by standard insurance markets. Select Risk’s products are distributed throughout the United States through specialist producers, program agents and brokers.

Life & Group Non-Core

The Life & Group
Non-Core segment primarily includes the results of the life and group lines of business that are in run-off. CNA continues to service its existing individual long term care commitments, its payout annuity business and its







pension deposit business. CNA also retains a block of group reinsurance and life settlement contracts. These businesses are being managed as a run-off operation. CNA’s group long term care
business, while considered non-core, continues to be actively marketed. During 2008, CNA exited the indexed group annuity portion of its pension deposit business.

Other Insurance

Other Insurance primarily includes
certain CNA corporate expenses, including interest on CNA corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and asbestos and environmental pollution (“A&EP”). In 2010, CNA ceded
substantially all of its legacy A&EP liabilities under the Loss Portfolio Transfer, as further discussed in Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

Please read Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
by Business Segment – CNA Financial” for information with respect to each segment.

Property and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expenses

The following loss reserve development table illustrates the change over time of reserves established for property and
casualty claim and claim adjustment expenses at the end of the preceding ten calendar years for CNA’s property and casualty insurance companies. The table excludes CNA’s life subsidiaries, and as such, the carried reserves will not agree
to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8. The first section shows the reserves as originally reported at the end of the stated year. The second section, reading down, shows the cumulative amounts paid as of the end of
successive years with respect to the originally reported reserve liability. The third section, reading down, shows re-estimates of the originally recorded reserves as of the end of each successive year, which is the result of CNA’s
property and casualty insurance subsidiaries’ expanded awareness of additional facts and circumstances that pertain to the unsettled claims. The last section compares the latest re-estimated reserves to the reserves originally established, and
indicates whether the original reserves were adequate or inadequate to cover the estimated costs of unsettled claims.







The loss reserve development table is cumulative and, therefore, ending
balances should not be added since the amount at the end of each calendar year includes activity for both the current and prior years. The development amounts in the table below include the impact of commutations, but exclude the impact of the
allowance for doubtful accounts on reinsurance receivables.

Investments

Please read Item 7, MD&A – Investments and Notes 1, 3, 4 and 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included under Item 8.

Other

Competition:The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service.
CNA competes with stock and mutual insurance companies, reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and customers. CNA must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance products and services.

Rates among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation. CNA competes for business not only
on the basis of rate, but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers, financial strength, ratings and quality of service, including claim adjustment services.

There are approximately 2,400 individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the United States. Based
on 2009 statutory net written premiums, CNA is the seventh largest commercial insurance writer and the 13th largest property and casualty insurance organization in the United States.

Regulation:The insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision
throughout the United States. Each state has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents, approving policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, prescribing the form and content of
statutory financial reports, and regulating capital adequacy and the type, quality and amount of investments permitted. Such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations, which require that rates not be excessive, inadequate or unfairly
discriminatory. In addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state insurance regulators, depending on the size of such transfers and payments in
relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the transfer or payment.

Insurers are
also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers. Each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks.
CNA’s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state.

Further, insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance-related assessments. Guaranty fund
assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers. Other insurance-related assessments are generally levied by state agencies to fund various organizations including disaster relief funds, rating
bureaus, insurance departments, and workers’ compensation second injury funds, or by industry organizations that assist in the statistical analysis and ratemaking process.

Although the federal government does not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal legislative and regulatory
initiatives can impact the insurance industry in a variety of ways. These initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals; proposals addressing natural catastrophe exposures; terrorism risk mechanisms; federal financial services reforms;
various tax proposals affecting insurance companies; and possible regulatory limitations, impositions and restrictions arising from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care
Act, both enacted in 2010.

Various legislative and regulatory efforts to reform the tort liability system
have, and will continue to, impact CNA’s industry. Although there has been some tort reform with positive impact to the insurance industry, new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by
federal or state legislatures that continue to expand liability for insurers and their policyholders. For example, some state legislatures have from time to time considered legislation addressing direct action against insurers related to bad faith
claims. As a result of this







unpredictability in the law, insurance underwriting is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines, professional liability and other specialty coverages.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act expands the federal presence in insurance oversight and may
increase the regulatory requirements to which CNA may be subject. The Act’s requirements include streamlining the state-based regulation of reinsurance and nonadmitted insurance (property or casualty insurance placed from insurers that are
eligible to accept insurance, but are not licensed to write insurance in a particular state). The Act also establishes a new Federal Insurance Office within the U.S. Department of the Treasury with powers over all lines of insurance except health
insurance, certain long term care insurance and crop insurance, to, among other things, monitor aspects of the insurance industry, identify issues in the regulation of insurers that could contribute to a systemic crisis in the insurance industry or
the overall financial system, coordinate federal policy on international insurance matters and preempt state insurance measures under certain circumstances. The Act calls for numerous studies and contemplates further regulation.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related amendments in the Health Care and Education Reconciliation
Act may increase CNA’s operating costs and underwriting losses. This landmark legislation may lead to numerous changes in the health care industry that could create additional operating costs for CNA, particularly with respect to workers’
compensation and long term care products. These costs might arise through the increased use of health care services by claimants or the increased complexities in health care bills that could require additional levels of review. In addition, due to
the expected number of new participants in the health care system and the potential for additional malpractice claims, CNA may experience increased underwriting risk in the lines of business that provide management and professional liability
insurance to individuals and businesses engaged in the health care industry. The lines of business that provide professional liability insurance to attorneys, accountants and other professionals who advise clients regarding the health care reform
legislation may also experience increased underwriting risk due to the complexity of the legislation.

Properties: The Chicago location owned by CCC, a wholly owned subsidiary of CNA, houses CNA’s principal
executive offices. CNA owns or leases office space in various cities throughout the United States and in other countries. The following table sets forth certain information with respect to CNA’s principal office locations:

DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.

Diamond Offshore Drilling, Inc. (“Diamond Offshore”), is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the business of
owning and operating drilling rigs that are used in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons. Diamond Offshore owns 46 offshore rigs. Diamond Offshore
accounted for 23.0%, 25.9% and 26.3% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Rigs:Diamond Offshore owns and operates 32 semisubmersible rigs, consisting of 13 high specification and 19 intermediate rigs. Semisubmersible rigs consist of an upper working and living deck
resting on vertical columns connected to lower hull members. Such rigs operate in a “semi-submerged” position, remaining afloat, off bottom, in a position in which the lower hull is approximately 55 feet to 90 feet below the water line and
the upper deck protrudes well above the surface. Semisubmersible rigs are typically anchored in position and remain stable for drilling in the semi-submerged floating position due in part to their wave transparency characteristics at the water line.
Semisubmersible rigs can also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster (“dynamic-positioning”) system to maintain the rig’s position over a drillsite. Five semisubmersible rigs in Diamond Offshore’s
fleet have this capability.

Diamond Offshore’s high specification semisubmersible rigs are generally
capable of working in water depths of 4,000 feet or greater or in harsh environments and have other advanced features, as compared to intermediate semisubmersible rigs. Five high specification rigs have nominal water depth capability of 10,000 feet;
one of 8,000 feet; one of 7,000 feet; five of 5,500 to 5,250 feet; and one of 4,000 feet. As of January 24, 2011, six of Diamond Offshore’s 13 high specification semisubmersible rigs were located offshore Brazil, and two were located in
the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (“GOM”). Of Diamond Offshore’s remaining high specification semisubmersible rigs, one was located offshore each of Angola, Egypt, Indonesia and the Republic of Congo and one was in a shipyard in Singapore.

Diamond Offshore’s intermediate semisubmersible rigs generally work in maximum water depths up to 3,999
feet. As of January 24, 2011, Diamond Offshore had 19 intermediate semisubmersible rigs in various locations around the world. Nine of these semisubmersible rigs were operating in the South America region, including eight offshore Brazil and
one offshore the Falkland Islands; three were located in the North Sea; two were located offshore Australia; one was located offshore Vietnam and one was cold stacked in Malaysia. Diamond Offshore’s remaining three intermediate semisubmersible
rigs are located in the GOM, where two have been cold stacked.

Diamond Offshore has one high specification
drillship, theOcean Clipper,which was located offshore Brazil as of January 24, 2011. Drillships, which are typically self-propelled, are positioned over a drillsite through the use of either an anchoring system or a
dynamic-positioning system similar to those used on certain semisubmersible rigs. Deepwater drillships compete in many of the same markets as do high specification semisubmersible rigs.

Diamond Offshore has 13 jack-up drilling rigs. Jack-up rigs are mobile, self-elevating drilling platforms equipped with
legs that are lowered to the ocean floor until a foundation is established to support the drilling platform. The rig hull includes the drilling rig, jacking system, crew quarters, loading and unloading facilities, storage areas for bulk and liquid
materials, heliport and other related equipment. Diamond Offshore’s jack-up rigs are used for drilling in water depths from 20 feet to 350 feet. The water depth limit of a particular rig is principally determined by the length of the rig’s
legs. A jack-up rig is towed to the drillsite with its hull riding in the sea, as a vessel, with its legs retracted. Once over a drillsite, the legs are lowered until they rest on the seabed and jacking continues with the legs penetrating the seabed
until resistance is sufficient to elevate the hull above the surface of the water. After completion of drilling operations, the hull is lowered until it rests in the water and then the legs are retracted for relocation to another drillsite.

As of January 24, 2011, six of Diamond Offshore’s 13 jack-up rigs were located in the GOM, of which
four rigs have been cold stacked, consisting of two mat-supported cantilevered rigs, one mat-supported slot rig and one independent-leg, cantilevered rig. Of Diamond Offshore’s seven remaining jack-up rigs, all of which are independent-leg
cantilevered rigs, two each were located offshore Egypt and Mexico, and one was located offshore each of Brazil and Montenegro. Diamond Offshore’s remaining jack-up rig was en route to Thailand.

Fleet Upgrades:Diamond Offshore’s long term strategy has been to economically upgrade its fleet to meet
customer demand for advanced, efficient, high-tech rigs, particularly deepwater semisubmersible rigs, in order to maximize the utilization of, and dayrates earned by, the rigs in its fleet. In December 2010 and January 2011, Diamond Offshore







entered into separate turnkey contracts with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. Ltd., (“Hyundai”), for the construction of two dynamically positioned, ultra-deepwater drillships with
deliveries scheduled for late in the second and fourth quarters of 2013. Diamond Offshore expects total cost for the sister drillships, including commissioning, spares and project management, to aggregate approximately $1.2 billion. In addition,
Diamond Offshore has also obtained from Hyundai a fixed-price option for the purchase of a third drillship, which it has the right to exercise at any time before the end of the first quarter of 2011.

In June 2009 and September 2009, Diamond Offshore acquired two new-build deepwater, dynamically positioned,
semisubmersible drilling rigs, theOcean Courageand theOcean Valor. Including Diamond Offshore’s rig acquisitions in 2009 and its two recent drillship orders, Diamond Offshore has purchased, ordered or upgraded seven rigs with
capabilities in 10,000 feet of water over the last four years.

Markets:The principal markets for
Diamond Offshore’s contract drilling services are the following:



•South America, principally offshore Brazil and the Falkland Islands;



•Australia and Asia, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Vietnam;



•the Middle East, including Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia;



•Europe, principally in the United Kingdom, or U.K., and Norway;



•West Africa, including Angola and the Republic of Congo;



•The Mediterranean Basin, including Egypt; and



•the Gulf of Mexico, including the U.S. and Mexico.

Diamond Offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide. From time to time Diamond Offshore’s fleet operates in various
other markets throughout the world as the market demands.

Diamond Offshore believes its presence in multiple
markets is valuable in many respects. For example, Diamond Offshore believes that its experience with safety and other regulatory matters in the U.K. has been beneficial in Australia and other international areas in which Diamond Offshore operates,
while production experience it has gained through Brazilian and North Sea operations has potential application worldwide. Additionally, Diamond Offshore believes its performance for a customer in one market segment or area enables it to better
understand that customer’s needs and better serve that customer in different market segments or other geographic locations.

Diamond Offshore’s contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions. Diamond Offshore typically obtains its contracts through competitive bidding, although it is not
unusual for Diamond Offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding. Drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether or not such drilling results in a productive
well. Drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather conditions or other conditions beyond the control
of Diamond Offshore. Under dayrate contracts, Diamond Offshore generally pays operating expenses of the rig, including wages and the cost of incidental supplies. Historically, dayrate contracts have accounted for the majority of Diamond
Offshore’s revenues. In addition, from time to time, Diamond Offshore’s dayrate contracts may also provide for the ability to earn an incentive bonus from its customer based upon performance.

A dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well or a
group of wells, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a well-to-well contract, or a fixed term, which Diamond Offshore refers to as a term contract, and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling rig is destroyed or lost or if
drilling operations are suspended for an extended period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party to the contract. In addition, certain of Diamond Offshore’s
contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice, and in most circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer. The contract term in many instances may also be extended by the







customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells or for an additional length of time, generally at competitive market rates and mutually agreeable terms at the time of the
extension.

Customers:Diamond Offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base
that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, Diamond Offshore performed services for 46, 47 and 49 different customers. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, one of Diamond
Offshore’s two customers in Brazil, Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., or Petrobras, (a Brazilian multinational energy company that is majority-owned by the Brazilian government), accounted for 24.0%, 15.0% and 13.0% of Diamond Offshore’s
annual total consolidated revenues. OGX Petróleo e Gás Ltda., (“OGX”) (a privately owned Brazilian oil and natural gas company) accounted for 14.0% of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues in 2010. No
other customer accounted for 10.0% or more of Diamond Offshore’s annual total consolidated revenues during 2010, 2009 or 2008.

Brazil is the most active floater market in the world today. As of the date of this report, the greatest concentration of Diamond Offshore’s operating assets outside the United States is offshore
Brazil, where 16 rigs in its fleet are currently working. Diamond Offshore’s contract backlog attributable to its expected operations offshore Brazil is $1.6 billion, $1.5 billion and $987 million for the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, and $1.0
billion in the aggregate for the years 2014 to 2016. Please see MD&A under Item 7 for additional information.

Competition:The offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, none of which at the present time has a dominant market share. The drilling
industry has experienced consolidation in recent years and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Some of Diamond Offshore’s competitors may have greater financial or other resources than
Diamond Offshore. Diamond Offshore competes with offshore drilling contractors that together have more than 730 mobile rigs available worldwide.

The offshore contract drilling industry is influenced by a number of factors, including global economies and demand for oil and natural gas, current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas,
expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs.

Drilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Intense price competition is often the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job. Customers may
also consider rig availability and location, a drilling contractor’s operational and safety performance record, and condition and suitability of equipment. Diamond Offshore believes it competes favorably with respect to these factors.

Governmental Regulation:Diamond Offshore’s operations are subject to numerous
international, U.S., state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations, including regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, requiring removal and clean-up under some
circumstances, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, and may include laws or regulations pertaining to climate change, carbon emissions or energy use.

Operations Outside the United States:Diamond Offshore’s operations outside the U.S. accounted for
approximately 80.9%, 66.0% and 59.3% of its total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

Properties:Diamond Offshore owns an eight-story office building containing approximately 170,000 net rentable square feet on approximately 6.2 acres of land located in Houston, Texas, where
its corporate headquarters is located, two buildings totaling 39,000 square feet and 20 acres of land in New Iberia, Louisiana, for its offshore drilling warehouse and storage facility, a 13,000-square foot building and five acres of land in
Aberdeen, Scotland, for its North Sea operations, two buildings totaling 77,200 square feet and 11 acres of land in Macae, Brazil, for its South American operations and two buildings totaling 20,000 square feet and two acres of land in Ciudad del
Carmen, Mexico, for its Mexican operations. Additionally, Diamond Offshore currently leases various office, warehouse and storage facilities in Louisiana, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, Norway, Malaysia, Singapore, Egypt, Angola, Republic of Congo,
Vietnam and the U.K. to support its offshore drilling operations.

HIGHMOUNT EXPLORATION &
PRODUCTION LLC

HighMount is engaged in the exploration, production and marketing of natural gas, natural
gas liquids (predominantly ethane and propane) and, to a small extent, oil, primarily in the Permian Basin in Texas. HighMount holds interests in







developed and undeveloped acreage, wellbores and well facilities, which generally take the form of working interests in leases that have varying terms. HighMount’s interests in these
properties are, in many cases, held jointly with third parties and may be subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements with other parties as is customary in the oil
and gas industry. HighMount also owns or has interests in gathering systems which transport natural gas and natural gas liquids (“NGLs”), principally from its producing wells, to processing plants and pipelines owned by third parties.
HighMount accounted for 2.9%, 4.4% and 5.8% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

We use the following terms throughout this discussion of HighMount’s business, with “equivalent” volumes computed with oil and NGL quantities converted to Mcf, on an energy equivalent ratio
of one barrel to six Mcf:





Average price-Average price during the twelve-month period, prior to the date of the estimate, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each month within such period, unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements with customers, excluding escalations based upon future conditions

Bbl-Barrel (of oil or NGLs)

Bcf-Billion cubic feet (of natural gas)

Bcfe-Billion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Developed acreage-Acreage assignable to productive wells

Mcf-Thousand cubic feet (of natural gas)

Mcfe-Thousand cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

MMBbl-Million barrels (of oil or NGLs)

MMBtu-Million British thermal units

MMcf-Million cubic feet (of natural gas)

MMcfe-Million cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Productive wells-Producing wells and wells mechanically capable of production

Proved reserves-Quantities of natural gas, NGLs and oil which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in
the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations

Proved developed reserves-Proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment, infrastructure and operating
methods

Proved undeveloped reserves-Proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is
required

Tcf-Trillion cubic feet (of natural gas)

Tcfe-Trillion cubic feet of natural gas equivalent

Undeveloped acreage-Leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of economic quantities of oil or
gas

In addition, as used in this discussion of HighMount’s business, “gross
wells” refers to the total number of wells in which HighMount owns a working interest and “net wells” refers to the sum of each of the gross wells multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by HighMount in such well.
“Gross acres” refers to the total number of acres with respect to which HighMount owns or leases a mineral interest and “net acres” is the sum of each unit of gross acres covered by a lease or other arrangement multiplied by
HighMount’s percentage ownership interest in such gross acreage.

As of December 31, 2010, HighMount
owned 1.3 Tcfe of net proved reserves, of which 78.2% were classified as proved developed reserves. HighMount’s estimated total proved reserves consist of 944.9 Bcf of natural gas, 56.0 MMBbls of NGLs, and 3.2 MMBbls of oil and condensate.
HighMount produced approximately 211 MMcfe per day of natural gas, NGLs and oil during 2010. HighMount holds leasehold or drilling rights in 0.7 million net acres, of which 0.4 million is developed acreage and the balance is held for
future exploration and development drilling opportunities. HighMount participated in the drilling of 238 wells during 2010, of which 227 (or 95.4%) are productive wells.

Sale of Assets:On April 30, 2010, HighMount completed the sale of substantially all exploration and
production assets located in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and on May 28, 2010, HighMount completed the sale of substantially all exploration and production assets located in the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama. The Michigan and Alabama
properties







represented approximately 17% in aggregate of HighMount’s total proved reserves as of December 31, 2009. HighMount used the net proceeds from the sales, of approximately $500 million,
to reduce the outstanding debt under its term loans.

Reserves:HighMount’s
reserves disclosed in this Report represent its share of reserves based on its net revenue interest in each property. Estimated reserves as of December 31, 2010 are based upon studies for each of HighMount’s properties prepared by
HighMount staff engineers and are the responsibility of management. Calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry and in accordance with Securities and Exchange Commission
(“SEC”) guidelines.

HighMount implements various internal controls to assure objectivity of the
reserve estimation process. The main internal controls include (a) detailed reviews of reserve-related information at various levels of the organization – Reserve Engineering and Executive Management, (b) reserve audit performed by an
independent third party reserve auditor, (c) segregation of duties and (d) system reconciliation or automated interface between various systems used in the reserve estimation process.

HighMount employs a team of reservoir engineers that specialize in HighMount’s area of operation. The reservoir
engineering team is separate from HighMount’s operating division and reports to HighMount’s Chief Operating Officer. The compensation of HighMount’s reservoir engineers is not dependent on the quantity of reserves booked.
HighMount’s lead evaluator has over twenty five years of oil and gas engineering experience, nine of those in the reservoir discipline. He has a registered professional engineering license from the State of Oklahoma and is a member in good
standing of the Society of Petroleum Engineers.

Ryder Scott Company, L.P., an independent third party
petroleum engineering consulting firm, has audited HighMount’s reserve estimates in accordance with the “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum
Engineers. Ryder Scott’s lead reservoir engineer responsible for the reserve audit has more than thirty years of experience in the field of estimation and evaluation of petroleum reserves and resources. He has the professional qualifications of
a Reserve Estimator and a Reserve Auditor set forth in Article III of the “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information” promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. He earned a Bachelor of
Science degree in Chemical Engineering at the University of Notre Dame in 1975 and a Masters of Business Administration at the University of Texas at Austin in 1998. He is a licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas. He is also a member
of the Society of Petroleum Engineers, the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, and the Houston’s Producers Forum.

The following table sets forth HighMount’s proved reserves at December 31, 2010, based on average 2010 prices of $4.38 per MMBtu for natural gas, $43.75 per Bbl for NGLs and $79.43 per Bbl for
oil. Substantially all proved reserves were located in the Permian Basin.

During
2010, total proved reserves declined 664 Bcfe, due to sales of assets, negative revisions of proved reserves and production. The sales of HighMount’s assets, primarily in Michigan and Alabama, reduced proved reserves by 364 Bcfe. HighMount
reviews its proved reserves on an annual basis. Based on recent higher decline rates of producing wells, HighMount reduced its estimate of proved reserves by 223 Bcfe, net of additions. During 2010, HighMount produced 77 Bcfe.

During 2010, HighMount’s proved undeveloped reserves decreased by 100 Bcfe, largely due to the sale of
HighMount’s assets in Michigan and Alabama, totaling 80 Bcfe, as discussed above, and reserve revisions. As a result of HighMount’s reduced pace of activity, drilling plans for a significant portion of HighMount’s proved undeveloped
reserves extended beyond five years. Due to the five year limitation on proved undeveloped reserves, HighMount reclassified 208 Bcfe of proved undeveloped reserves to the non-proved category. Subsequently, 238 Bcfe of probable







reserves were promoted to the proved undeveloped category, as these pertain to locations HighMount expects to drill during the next five years. During 2010, HighMount also converted 8 Bcfe from
proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves through drilling. The remaining revisions are a result of anticipated lower reserves for each proved undeveloped location.

Estimated net quantities of proved natural gas and oil (including condensate and NGLs) reserves at December 31,
2010, 2009 and 2008 and changes in the reserves during 2010, 2009 and 2008 are shown in Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.

HighMount’s properties typically have relatively long reserve lives, high well completion success rates and
predictable production profiles. Based on December 31, 2010 proved reserves and HighMount’s average production from these properties during 2010, the average reserve-to-production index of HighMount’s proved reserves is 19 years.

In order to replenish reserves as they are depleted by production, and to increase reserves, HighMount
further develops its existing acreage by drilling new wells and, where available, employing new technologies and drilling strategies designed to enhance production from existing wells. HighMount seeks to opportunistically acquire additional acreage
in its core areas of operation, as well as other locations where its management has identified an opportunity.

During the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, HighMount engaged in the drilling activity presented in the
following table. All wells drilled during 2010, 2009 and 2008 disclosed in the table below were development wells.

(a)Represents wells drilled in the Antrim Shale in Michigan and the Black Warrior Basin in Alabama, which were sold in 2010.

In addition, at December 31, 2010, HighMount had two exploratory wells still under
evaluation.

Acreage:As of December 31, 2010, HighMount owned interests in 591,063 gross
developed acres (446,928 net developed acres) and 529,776 gross undeveloped acres (274,557 net undeveloped acres) primarily in the Permian Basin.

Production and Sales:Please see the Production and Sales statistics table for additional information included in the MD&A under Item 7.

HighMount utilizes its own marketing and sales personnel to market the natural gas and NGLs that it produces to large
energy companies and intrastate pipelines and gathering companies. Production is typically sold and delivered directly to a pipeline at liquid pooling points or at the tailgates of various processing plants, where it then enters a pipeline system.
Permian Basin natural gas sales prices are primarily at a Houston Ship Channel Index.







To manage the risk of fluctuations in prevailing commodity prices, HighMount
enters into commodity and basis swaps and other derivative instruments.

Wells:As of
December 31, 2010, HighMount had an interest in 6,134 gross producing wells (5,800 net producing wells) located in the Permian Basin. Wells located in the Permian Basin have a typical well depth in the range of 6,000 to 9,000 feet.

Competition:HighMount competes with other oil and gas companies in all aspects of its business, including
acquisition of producing properties and leases and obtaining goods, services and labor, including drilling rigs and well completion services. HighMount also competes in the marketing of produced natural gas and NGLs. Some of HighMount’s
competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources than HighMount. Factors that affect HighMount’s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds, available information about the property and standards
established by HighMount for minimum projected return on investment. Natural gas and NGLs also compete with alternative fuel sources, including heating oil, imported liquefied natural gas and other fossil fuels.

Governmental Regulation:All of HighMount’s operations are conducted onshore in the United States. The
U.S. oil and gas industry, and HighMount’s operations, are subject to regulation at the federal, state and local level. Such regulation includes requirements with respect to, among other things: permits to drill and to conduct other
operations; provision of financial assurances (such as bonds) covering drilling and well operations; the location of wells; the method of drilling and completing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the
plugging and abandoning of wells; the marketing, transportation and reporting of production; and the valuation and payment of royalties; the size of drilling and spacing units (regarding the density of wells which may be drilled in a particular
area); the unitization or pooling of properties; maximum rates of production from wells; venting or flaring of natural gas and the ratability of production.

The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) to prohibit natural gas market manipulation by any entity, directed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
(“FERC”) to facilitate market transparency in the sale or transportation of physical natural gas and significantly increased the penalties for violations of the NGA of 1938, the NGA of 1978, or FERC regulations or orders thereunder. In
addition, HighMount owns and operates gas gathering lines and related facilities which are regulated by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and state agencies with respect to safety and operating conditions.

HighMount’s operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations concerning the discharge of
contaminants into the environment, the generation, storage, transportation and disposal of contaminants, and the protection of public health, natural resources, wildlife and the environment. In most instances, the regulatory requirements relate to
the handling and disposal of drilling and production waste products, water and air pollution control procedures, and the remediation of petroleum-product contamination. In addition, HighMount’s operations may require it to obtain permits for,
among other things, air emissions, discharges into surface waters, and the construction and operation of underground injection wells or surface pits to dispose of produced saltwater and other non-hazardous oilfield wastes. HighMount could be
required, without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal, to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes, to suspend or cease operations in contaminated areas or to perform remedial well plugging operations or cleanups to
prevent future contamination.

In September 2009, the United States Environmental Protection Agency
(“EPA”) adopted regulations under the Clean Air Act requiring the monitoring and reporting of annual greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by certain large U.S. GHG emitters. Affected companies are required to monitor their GHG
emissions and report to the EPA beginning in March 2011. Oil and gas exploration and production companies that emit less than 25,000 metric tons of GHG per year from any facility (as defined in the regulations), including HighMount, are not required
to monitor or report emissions at this time. However, the EPA has indicated it will issue a proposed rule for comment as it pertains to Oil and Gas Systems.

Properties:In addition to its interests in oil and gas producing properties, HighMount leases an aggregate of approximately 62,000 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas, which
includes its corporate headquarters, and approximately 92,000 square feet of office space in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. HighMount also leases other surface rights and office, warehouse and storage facilities necessary to operate its business.







BOARDWALK PIPELINE PARTNERS, LP

Boardwalk Pipeline Partners, LP (“Boardwalk Pipeline”) is engaged in the interstate transportation and storage
of natural gas. Boardwalk Pipeline accounted for 7.7%, 6.4% and 6.4% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

We own approximately 66% of Boardwalk Pipeline comprised of 102,719,466 common units, 22,866,667 class B units and a 2%
general partner interest. A wholly owned subsidiary of ours (“BPHC”) is the general partner and holds all of Boardwalk Pipeline’s incentive distribution rights which entitle the general partner to an increasing percentage of the cash
that is distributed by Boardwalk Pipeline in excess of $0.4025 per unit per quarter.

Boardwalk Pipeline owns
and operates three interstate natural gas pipelines, with approximately 14,200 miles of interconnected pipelines, directly serving customers in 12 states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern United States
through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines. In 2010, its pipeline systems transported approximately 2.5 trillion cubic feet (“Tcf”) of gas. Average daily throughput on Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems during
2010 was approximately 6.8 billion cubic feet (“Bcf”). Boardwalk Pipeline’s natural gas storage facilities are comprised of 11 underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately
167.0 Bcf.

Boardwalk Pipeline conducts all of its operations through its three operating subsidiaries:

Gulf Crossing Pipeline Company LLC (“Gulf Crossing”): The Gulf Crossing pipeline system, which
originates in Texas and proceeds into Louisiana, operates approximately 360 miles of natural gas pipeline. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 1.7 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2010
was 1.3 Bcf per day.

Gulf South Pipeline Company, L.P. (“Gulf South”): The Gulf South pipeline
system runs approximately 7,700 miles along the Gulf Coast in the states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Florida. Gulf South has two natural gas storage facilities with 83.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity. The pipeline system has
a peak-day delivery capacity of 6.8 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year ended December 31, 2010 was 4.1 Bcf per day.

Texas Gas Transmission, LLC (“Texas Gas”): The Texas Gas pipeline system originates in Louisiana, East Texas and Arkansas and runs for approximately 6,110 miles north and east through
Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, and into Ohio, with smaller diameter lines extending into Illinois. The pipeline system has a peak-day delivery capacity of 4.8 Bcf per day and average daily throughput for the year
ended December 31, 2010 was 3.0 Bcf per day. Texas Gas owns nine natural gas storage fields, of which it owns the majority of the working and base gas, with 84.0 Bcf of working gas storage capacity.

Boardwalk Pipeline serves a broad mix of customers, including producers, local distribution companies, marketers,
intrastate and interstate pipelines, electric power generators and direct industrial users located throughout the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Northeast regions of the U.S.

Competition:Boardwalk Pipeline competes with other pipelines to maintain current business levels and to
serve new demand and markets. Boardwalk Pipeline also competes with other pipelines for contracts with producers that would support new growth opportunities. The principal elements of competition among pipelines are available capacity, rates, terms
of service, access to gas supplies, flexibility and reliability of service. Due to the construction of new pipeline systems in the U.S. over the past several years, as well as pipelines currently under development, competition has become stronger in
Boardwalk Pipeline’s market areas. Many of these new pipelines are in areas outside Boardwalk Pipeline’s service area and are closer to end-users than Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. In addition, regulators’ continuing
efforts to increase competition in the natural gas industry have increased the natural gas transportation options of Boardwalk Pipeline’s traditional customers. As a result of the regulators’ policies, segmentation and capacity release
have created an active secondary market which increasingly competes with Boardwalk Pipeline’s services. Additionally, natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Boardwalk Pipeline’s customers, including electricity, coal,
fuel oils and other alternative fuel sources.







Seasonality:Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenues can be affected by weather and natural gas price levels and
volatility. Weather impacts natural gas demand for heating needs and power generation, which in turn influences the short term value of transportation and storage across Boardwalk Pipeline’s pipeline systems. Colder than normal winters can
result in an increase in the demand for natural gas for heating needs and warmer than normal summers can impact cooling needs, both of which typically result in increased pipeline transportation revenues and throughput. While traditionally peak
demand for natural gas occurs during the winter months driven by heating needs, the increased use of natural gas for cooling needs during the summer months has partially reduced the seasonality of revenues over time. During 2010, approximately 53.9%
of Boardwalk Pipeline’s revenue was recognized in the first and fourth quarters of the year.

Governmental Regulation:

Boardwalk Pipeline is also regulated by the DOT under the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended by Title I
of the Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, which regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipelines. Boardwalk Pipeline has received authority from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), an agency of DOT, to operate certain pipeline assets under special permits that will allow it to operate those assets at higher than normal operating pressures of up to 0.80 of the pipe’s Specified
Minimum Yield Strength (“SMYS”). Operating at the higher than normal operating pressures will allow each of these pipelines to transport all of the volumes Boardwalk Pipeline has contracted for with its customers. PHMSA retains discretion
whether to grant or maintain authority for Boardwalk Pipeline to operate these pipelines at higher pressures.

Boardwalk Pipeline’s operations are also subject to extensive federal, state, and local laws and regulations
relating to protection of the environment. Such regulations impose, among other things, restrictions, liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation, handling, use, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous
substances and waste and in connection with spills, releases and emissions of various substances into the environment. Environmental regulations also require that Boardwalk Pipeline’s facilities, sites and other properties be operated,
maintained, abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities.







Properties:Boardwalk Pipeline is headquartered in approximately
108,000 square feet of leased office space located in Houston, Texas. Boardwalk Pipeline also has approximately 108,000 square feet of office space in Owensboro, Kentucky in a building that it owns. Boardwalk Pipeline’s operating subsidiaries
own their respective pipeline systems in fee. However, substantial portions of these systems are constructed and maintained on property owned by others pursuant to rights-of-way, easements, permits, licenses or consents.

LOEWS HOTELS HOLDING CORPORATION

The subsidiaries of Loews Hotels Holding Corporation (“Loews Hotels”), our wholly owned subsidiary, presently
operate the following 18 hotels. Loews Hotels accounted for 2.1%, 2.0% and 2.9% of our consolidated total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.

(b)A Loews Hotels subsidiary is a 50% owner of these hotels located at the Universal Orlando theme park, through a joint venture with Universal Studios
and the Rank Group. The hotels are on land leased by the joint venture and are operated by Loews Hotels pursuant to a management contract.

The hotels owned by Loews Hotels are subject to mortgage indebtedness totaling approximately $220 million at December 31, 2010 with interest rates ranging from 2.5% to 6.3%, and maturing between 2011
and 2028. In addition, certain hotels are held under leases which are subject to formula derived rental increases, with rentals aggregating approximately $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2010.

Competition from other hotels and lodging facilities is vigorous in all areas in which Loews Hotels operates. The demand
for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions. Loews Hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located.
Competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and service. Competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service. Because of the competitive nature of the industry, hotels must continually
make expenditures for updating, refurnishing and repairs and maintenance, in order to prevent competitive obsolescence.

EMPLOYEE RELATIONS

Including our operating subsidiaries as described below, we employed approximately 18,400 persons at December 31, 2010. We, and our subsidiaries, have experienced satisfactory labor relations.

CNA employed approximately 8,000 persons.

Diamond Offshore employed approximately 5,300 persons, including international crew personnel furnished through
independent labor contractors.

HighMount employed approximately 400 persons.

Boardwalk Pipeline employed approximately 1,100 persons, approximately 115 of whom are included in collective bargaining
units.
