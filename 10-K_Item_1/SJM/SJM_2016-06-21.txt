Item 1.        Business.

The Company. The J. M. Smucker Company (“Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was established in 1897, was incorporated in Ohio in 1921, and is often referred to as Smucker’s (a registered trademark). We operate principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food and beverage products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of our sales are in the U.S. Our operations outside the U.S. are principally in Canada, although products are exported to other countries as well. Net sales outside the U.S., subject to foreign currency translation, represented 6 percent of consolidated net sales for2016. Our branded food and beverage products include a strong portfolio of trusted, iconic, market-leading brands that are sold to consumers through retail outlets in North America.

On December 31, 2015, we sold our U.S. canned milk brands and operations to Eagle Family Foods Group LLC, a subsidiary of funds affiliated with Kelso & Company. The transaction included canned milk products that were primarily sold in U.S. retail and foodservice channels under theEagle Brand®andMagnolia®brands, along with other branded and private label trade names, with annual net sales of approximately $200.0 million. For additional information on the U.S. canned milk transaction, see “Note 4: Divestiture” in our2016Annual Report to Shareholders.

On March 23, 2015, we completed the acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands (“Big Heart”), a leading producer, distributor, and marketer of premium-quality, branded pet food and pet snacks in the U.S. The cash and stock transaction was valued at $5.9 billion, which included the issuance of 17.9 million shares of our common stock to the shareholders of Blue Acquisition Group, Inc., Big Heart’s parent company. After the closing of the transaction, we had approximately 120.0 million common shares outstanding. We assumed $2.6 billion in debt that we repaid at closing and paid an additional $1.2 billion in cash, net of a working capital adjustment. As part of the transaction, new debt of $5.5 billion was borrowed. For additional information on the Big Heart acquisition, see “Note 2: Acquisitions” in our2016Annual Report to Shareholders.

We have three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and U.S. Retail Pet Foods. The U.S. retail market segments in total comprised over 85 percent of2016consolidated net sales and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food and beverage products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets in North America. Within our segment results, International and Foodservice represents a combination of the strategic business areas not included in the U.S. retail market segments.

Principal Products. Our principal products are coffee, pet food, pet snacks, peanut butter, fruit spreads, shortening and oils, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings, frozen sandwiches, flour and baking ingredients, juices and beverages, and portion control products.

Product sales information for the years2016,2015, and2014is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth in our2016Annual Report to Shareholders under “Note 5: Reportable Segments.”

In the U.S. retail market segments, our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, military commissaries, natural foods stores and distributors, and pet specialty stores. In International and Foodservice, our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels and foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, lodging, schools and universities, health care operators).

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials. The raw materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Green coffee, grains, peanuts, edible oils, sweeteners, fruit, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The availability, quality, and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. Basis, futures, and options contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs. Green coffee, along with certain other raw materials, is sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price is subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, pest damage, investor speculation, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. We source grains, peanuts, and edible oils mainly from North America. The principal packaging materials we use are plastic, glass, metal cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate. For additional information on the commodities we purchase, see “Commodities Overview” in our2016Annual Report to Shareholders.

Raw materials are generally available from numerous sources, although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary year-to-year, we believe that we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to single-sourced materials are








available. We have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials. We consider our relationships with key raw material suppliers to be in good standing.

Trademarks and Patents. Our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under numerous trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries. Our major trademarks are listed below.

We own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

We consider all of our owned and licensed intellectual property, taken as a whole, to be essential to our business.

Seasonality. The U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segments are particularly seasonal around the Fall Bake and Holiday period, which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters. Our success in promoting and merchandising our coffee and baking brands during the Fall Bake and Holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year. The Back to School period and the Spring Holiday season are two other important promotional periods, although their impact is not as significant as the Fall Bake and Holiday period.

Working Capital. Working capital requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee, oil, and baking inventories necessary to support the Fall Bake and Holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season. Although we still expect an inventory buildup during the first half of the fiscal year within the U.S. Retail Coffee and U.S. Retail Consumer Foods businesses, our working capital requirements have become less seasonal overall with the addition of the pet food business.








Customers. Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries amounted to 30 percent, 28 percent, and 27 percent of net sales in2016,2015, and2014, respectively. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segments. The increase in 2016 was driven by a full year of sales from the pet food business, in which sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and subsidiaries represent a larger portion of net sales, as compared to our business prior to the Big Heart acquisition. No other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during2016,2015, or2014.

During2016, our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 70 percent of consolidated net sales. Supermarkets, warehouse clubs, and food distributors continue to consolidate, and we expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands.

Orders. Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has not been material on a historical basis.

Government Business. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition. We are the branded market leader in the coffee, peanut butter, dog snacks, fruit spreads, shortening, natural beverage, and ice cream toppings categories in the U.S. In Canada, we are the branded market leader in the flour, pickles, canned milk, fruit spreads, shortening, and ice cream toppings categories. Our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products.

In order to remain competitive, companies in the food industry need to consider emerging consumer preferences, technological advances, product and packaging innovations, and the continued growth of alternative store formats, including warehouse clubs, convenience stores, and e-commerce. The primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are brand recognition, product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value, convenience, advertising, promotion, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include well-recognized brands, high-quality products, consumer trust, experienced brand and category management, a single national grocery broker in the U.S., varied product offerings, product innovation, good customer service, and an integrated distribution network.

The packaged foods industry has been challenged recently by a general decline in sales volume in the center of the store. Certain evolving consumer trends have contributed to the decline, such as a heightened focus on health and wellness, an increased desire for fresh foods, and the growing impact of social media and e-commerce on consumer behavior. To address these dynamics, we continue to focus on innovation with an increased emphasis on products that satisfy evolving consumer trends.

In addition, private label has grown in recent years due to general economic uncertainty, improvements in private label quality, and the increased emphasis of store brands by retailers in an effort to cultivate customer loyalty. We believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in the food categories in which we compete, appealing to different consumer segments. We closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands, with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that number one brands will continue to be an integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets.

Research and Development. We predominantly utilize in-house resources to both develop new products and improve existing products in each of our business areas. Amounts expensed for research and development were$58.8million, $32.5 million, and $24.3 million in2016,2015, and2014, respectively.

Environmental Matters. We consider environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area. We have implemented and manage a variety of programs, including the utilization of renewable energy technology, wastewater management, the usage of sustainable raw materials including green coffee, and the reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones, in support of our commitment to environmental sustainability. We continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce waste and limit our impact on the environment.

Compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal, state, and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in 2017.

Employees. AtApril 30, 2016, we had 6,910 full-time employees worldwide, of which 30 percent, located at 11 manufacturing facilities, are covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on the location, with one contract expiring in 2017, representing 8 percent of our total employees. We believe our relations with our employees are good.
