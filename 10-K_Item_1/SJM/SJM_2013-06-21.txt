Item 1.  Business.

The Company.The J. M. Smucker
Company (“Company,” “registrant,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was established in 1897, was incorporated in Ohio in 1921, and is often referred to asSmucker’s(a registered trademark). We
operate principally in one industry, the manufacturing and marketing of branded food products on a worldwide basis, although the majority of our sales are in the U.S. Our operations outside the U.S. are principally in Canada, although products are
exported to other countries as well. Net sales outside the U.S. represented approximately 9 percent of consolidated net sales for 2013. Our branded food products include a strong portfolio of trusted, iconic, market-leading brands that are sold to
consumers through retail outlets in North America.

On November 6, 2008, we completed a merger transaction with The Folgers Coffee
Company (“Folgers”), a subsidiary of The Procter & Gamble Company (“P&G”). The value of the transaction was approximately $3.7 billion, including the issuance of common shares of the Company in connection with the
merger and $350 million of Folgers debt. Under the terms of the transaction agreements, P&G distributed common shares of Folgers to participating P&G shareholders which were then automatically converted into the right to receive common
shares of the Company in the merger. Immediately following the merger, P&G shareholders and pre-merger Company shareholders owned approximately 53.5 percent and 46.5 percent, respectively, of the Company’s approximately 118 million
common shares outstanding. The merger was accounted for as a purchase business combination, and we were treated as the acquiring entity.

We have three reportable segments: U.S. Retail Coffee, U.S. Retail Consumer Foods, and International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods. The two U.S.
retail market segments in total comprised over 75 percent of consolidated net sales in 2013 and represent a major portion of our strategic focus – the sale of branded food products with leadership positions to consumers through retail outlets
in North America. The International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment represents sales outside of the U.S. retail markets, and has grown over the past year, primarily due to the full year contribution from the acquisition of the majority of
the North American foodservice coffee and hot beverage business from Sara Lee Corporation in January 2012.

Principal Products.
Our principal products are coffee, peanut butter, fruit spreads, shortening and oils, baking mixes and ready-to-spread frostings, canned milk, flour and baking ingredients, juices and beverages, frozen sandwiches, toppings, syrups, and pickles and
condiments.

Product sales information for the years 2013, 2012, and 2011 is incorporated herein by reference to information set forth
in our 2013 Annual Report to Shareholders, on pages 53 through 55 under “Note 5: Reportable Segments.”

In both of the U.S.
retail market segments, our products are primarily sold through a combination of direct sales and brokers to food retailers, food wholesalers, drug stores, club stores, mass merchandisers, discount and dollar stores, and military commissaries. In
the International, Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment, our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries through retail channels, foodservice distributors and operators (e.g., restaurants, lodging, schools and universities,
health care operators), and health and natural foods stores and distributors.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials. The raw
materials used in each of our segments are primarily commodities and agricultural-based products. Green coffee, peanuts, edible oils, sweeteners, milk, flour, corn, and other ingredients are obtained from various suppliers. The availability,
quality, and costs of many of these commodities have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, over time. Basis, futures, and options contracts are used to manage price volatility for a significant portion of our commodity costs. Green coffee is
sourced solely from foreign countries and its supply and price are subject to high volatility due to factors such as weather, global supply and demand, pest damage,






investor speculation, and political and economic conditions in the source countries. Fruit and vegetable raw materials used in the production of our food products are purchased from independent
growers and suppliers. The principal packaging materials we use are glass, plastic, steel cans, caps, carton board, and corrugate.

Raw
materials are generally available from numerous sources although we have elected to source certain plastic packaging materials from single sources of supply pursuant to long-term contracts. While availability may vary year-to-year, we believe that
we will continue to be able to obtain adequate supplies and that alternatives to single-sourced materials are available. We have not historically encountered significant shortages of key raw materials. We consider our relationships with key raw
material suppliers to be good.

Trademarks and Patents. Our products are produced under certain patents and marketed under
numerous trademarks owned or licensed by us or one of our subsidiaries. Our major trademarks are listed below.

We own several hundred patents worldwide in addition to proprietary trade secrets, technology,
know-how processes, and other intellectual property rights that are not registered.

We consider all of our owned and licensed
intellectual property, taken as a whole, to be essential to our business.

Seasonality.   The U.S. Retail Coffee and
U.S. Retail Consumer Foods segments are particularly seasonal around the “Fall Bake” and holiday period, which generally results in higher sales and profits in our second and third quarters. Our success in promoting and merchandising our
baking and coffee brands during the “Fall Bake” and holiday period has a significant impact on our results for a fiscal year. The back-to-school period and the spring holiday season are two other important promotional periods, although
their impact is not as significant as the “Fall Bake” and holiday period.

Working Capital.   Working capital
requirements are greatest during the first half of our fiscal year mainly due to the timing of the buildup of coffee, oil, and baking inventories necessary to support the “Fall Bake” and holiday period and the additional buildup of coffee
inventory in advance of the Atlantic hurricane season.

Customers.   Sales to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its
subsidiaries amounted to approximately 26 percent of net sales in 2013, 2012, and 2011. These sales are primarily included in the U.S. retail market segments. No other customer exceeded 10 percent of net sales during 2013, 2012, or 2011.

During 2013, our top 10 customers, collectively, accounted for approximately 63 percent of consolidated net sales. Although the loss of any large
customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to strong consumer demand for our brands.

Orders.   Generally, orders are filled within a few days of receipt, and the backlog of unfilled orders at any particular time has
not been material on a historical basis.

Government Business.   No material portion of our business is subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.

Competition.   We are the
branded market leader in the coffee, peanut butter, fruit spreads, shortening, sweetened condensed milk, ice cream toppings, and natural foods beverages categories in the U.S. In Canada, we are the branded market leader in the flour, pickles, canned
milk, fruit spreads, shortening, and ice cream toppings categories. Our business is highly competitive as all of our brands compete for retail shelf space with other branded products as well as private label products.

The continued growth of alternative store formats, product and packaging innovations, technological advances, and new industry techniques need to
be considered by companies in the food industry in order to remain competitive. The primary ways in which products and brands are distinguished are product quality, price, packaging, new product introductions, nutritional value, convenience,
advertising, and promotion. Positive factors pertaining to our competitive position include well-recognized brands, superior product quality and trust, experienced brand and category management, a single national grocery broker in the U.S., varied
product offerings, product innovation, good customer service, and an integrated distribution network.

Accelerated private label growth
is typically seen during periods of general economic disruption. Most recently during the period following the economic recession of the late 2000’s, it was estimated that private label grew more than during past periods partly due to the run
up in commodity costs, increased emphasis of store brands by retailers, and improvements in private label quality. We believe that both private label and leading brands play an important role in all of the food categories in which we compete,
appealing to different consumer segments. We closely monitor the price gap or price premium between our brands and private label brands, with the view that value is about more than price and the expectation that #1 brands will continue to be an
integral part of consumers’ shopping baskets.






In the U.S. Retail Coffee segment, theFolgersbrand competes in the
highly competitive U.S. packaged roast and ground coffee market with other retail coffee brands such asMaxwell House,Yuban, andNescafe. We participate in the premium coffee market with theMillstoneandFolgers
Gourmet Selections®brands, as well as through sales ofDunkin’ Donutsretail packaged
coffee products. Competitors include other brands such asStarbucks,Gevalia,Eight O’Clock,Seattle’s Best, andPeet’s Coffee & Tea. Through a manufacturing and distribution agreement with
Green Mountain Coffee Roasters, Inc. (“Green Mountain”) and Keurig, Inc., we compete in the single serve coffee market with theFolgers Gourmet SelectionsandMillstonepremium coffeesK-Cup®products. K-Cup competitors includeGreen Mountain,Starbucks,Eight O’Clock,Maxwell House, andGevalia, as well as many private label brands. We participate in the espresso coffee category with theCafé BusteloandCafé Pilonbrands.

In the International,
Foodservice, and Natural Foods segment, our products are distributed domestically and in foreign countries and compete with various brands within retail, foodservice, and natural foods markets.

Research and Development.   We predominantly utilize in-house resources to both develop new products and improve existing products
in each of our business areas. Amounts expensed for research and development were $24.7 million, $21.9 million, and $21.0 million in 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.

Environmental Matters.   We consider environmental sustainability to be our responsibility as a good corporate citizen and a key strategic focus area. We have implemented and manage a variety of
programs, including the utilization of renewable energy technology, improved wastewater management, increased usage of sustainable raw materials including green coffee, and reuse of resources rather than consuming new ones, in support of our
commitment to environmental sustainability. We continue to evaluate and modify our processes on an ongoing basis to further reduce our impact on the environment and reduce waste.

Compliance with the provisions of enacted or pending federal, state, and local environmental regulations regarding either the discharge of
materials into the environment or the protection of the environment is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position in 2014.






Employees.   At April 30, 2013, we had approximately 4,875 full-time employees
worldwide. Approximately 28 percent of these employees, located at nine facilities, are covered by union contracts. These contracts vary in term depending on the location, with four contracts expiring in 2014. We believe our relations with our
employees are good.
