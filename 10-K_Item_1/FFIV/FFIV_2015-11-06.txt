Item 1.Business

General

F5 Networks is the leading developer and provider of software-defined application services designed to ensure that applications delivered over Internet Protocol (IP) networks are secure, fast and available to any user, anywhere, anytime, on any device and on any network. Our core technology is a full-proxy, programmable, massively-scalable software platform called TMOS (Traffic Management Operating System).

Introduced in 2004, the TMOS platform supports the industry’s broadest array of application services, including local and global traffic management, network and application security, access management, web acceleration and a number of other network and application services. These services are available as software modules that can run individually or as part of an integrated solution on our high-performance, scalable, purpose-built BIG-IP appliances and chassis-based VIPRION systems; or as software-only Virtual Editions that run on all major hypervisors. Our cloud-based Silverline offerings allow customers to subscribe to online denial-of-service protection and application security services. In conjunction with our BIG-IQ management software, the availability of our application services as software on our purpose-built hardware, software-only and cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) gives customers the flexibility to create a dynamic hybrid infrastructure with consistent policies and centralized management across private and public clouds as well as traditional data centers.

The core features and functions of TMOS enable our products to inspect and modify the content of IP traffic flows and sessions between users and applications and support a broad and growing array of services. iRules, a scripting language based









on Tool Command Language (TCL) with node.js add-ons, is a unique feature of TMOS that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic. TMOS also has an open software interface called iControl, which allows our products to communicate with one another and with third-party products, and a scripting framework called iCall that lets users define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly. TMOS is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performance-enhancing features of our purpose-built hardware.

As information technology infrastructures continue to evolve, there is growing demand for software-only application services that can be deployed in virtual environments next to each instance of an application. For customers who prefer this option, our Virtual Edition (VE) products offer faster throughput than competing products and the broadest array of integrated application services available. We sell individual VEs of all modules available on our hardware-based solutions which provide the same software services and include all of the features and functions embedded in TMOS.

While VEs have lower performance than our hardware-based solutions, they give customers the flexibility to deploy a mix of integrated application services as needed, spinning them up and down with each instance of an application, and moving them with the application between traditional data centers and private or public clouds. Both VEs and hardware-based services can be and increasingly are deployed in hybrid infrastructures within data centers and private clouds, across multiple data centers, and across data centers and public clouds. Our BIG-IQ management platform supports software modules that enable customers to manage all of the F5 services running in these hybrid environments from a single management console.



In November 2014, we launched our cloud-based Silverline SaaS platform that allows customers to deploy enterprise-grade application services across hybrid environments without upfront investments in IT infrastructure and support. Available by subscription, Silverline services utilize F5 hardware and software product functionality, offer key features from our on-premise application services, are highly programmable, and include 24/7 access to experts in our Security Operations Center (SOC).

In addition to our TMOS-based application services, our products include our Traffix solutions for Diameter signaling and  routing, load balancing and gateway connectivity, designed to enable service providers to meet the multiple challenges associated with the growth of mobile data.

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of services including consulting, training, installation, maintenance and other technical support services.

Industry Background

Growth and Evolution of IP-Based Infrastructures

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to deliver applications and data over the Internet. For more than two decades, large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with IP-based infrastructures, deploying new IP-based applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new IP-enabled versions. This trend has been accompanied by the proliferation of mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets and laptops that allow users to access data and applications from almost anywhere. At the same time, virtualization of data centers and networks and the emergence of public clouds have given rise to dynamic hybrid infrastructures where applications are increasingly hosted off-premise as well as in traditional data centers and can move freely between locations as demand or other circumstances require.

Emergence of the Dynamic Data Center and Hybrid IT Infrastructures

In addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt, destroy or block access to network applications, organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data. The proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones, tablets, and laptops the ability to access corporate private and public data centers from virtually anywhere. This, in turn, has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized, and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users.

Need to Optimize the Secure Delivery of Applications and Data

With the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of IT infrastructures, there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over IP networks. IP-based traffic passing between end-user devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled. The disassembly, routing, and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence. By contrast, managing, inspecting, modifying, redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing an expanding array of functions. Broadly speaking, all of those functions are aspects of application delivery.











Although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider IT infrastructures, service providers face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones, tablets, wearables and other mobile devices. To cope with these challenges, service providers are migrating legacy 2G/3G infrastructures to 4G/LTE networks and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) data centers that require an array of network and application services. Today, most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors, and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices. Increasingly, they are also demanding software solutions designed to run on commodity hardware that can be repurposed as needed. To cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4G/LTE networks, the challenges of migrating legacy infrastructure, and the need to integrate charging and enforcement functions with subscriber data, service providers have also adopted the Diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data centers.

F5’s Strategy

Our goal is to lead the industry in providing application and network services that ensure the safe, fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user, anywhere, anytime regardless of a user's location or where the application resides. These services include availability, security, performance, mobility, and identity. They also include managing and orchestrating resources, as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers, networks and cloud-based resources. Our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the IT infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged. Key components of our strategy include:

Offering a complete, integrated suite of application services.

Since the introduction of TMOS, we have developed TMOS-based versions of our own legacy products, such as Local Traffic Manager (LTM), BIG-IP DNS and Link Controller; new products, such as Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM), Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) and Policy Enforcement Manager (PEM); and products that incorporate acquired technology, including Application Security Manager (ASM), Application Acceleration Manager (AAM), Access Policy Manager (APM) and our end-user protection services, WebSafe and MobileSafe. All of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our BIG-IP and VIPRION hardware and as Virtual Editions that run on any standard hypervisor. In addition, we offer online DDoS protection and application security as subscription services on our cloud-based Silverline SaaS platform. We believe this approach addresses the needs of today's evolving hybrid infrastructures and sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings.

Investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs.

We continue to invest in research and development efforts that leverage the unique attributes of our TMOS platform to deliver new features and functions that address the complex, changing needs of our customers. Although the bulk of our investment is software development, concurrent development of tightly integrated, high-performance hardware is a key part of our investment strategy. We also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets.

Expanding our addressable market.











Continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners.

Early on, we developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors, such as Microsoft, Oracle, VMware and others, who had an established presence in large enterprises. By taking advantage of iControl, our open application programming interface, and iCall, a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly, these vendors were able to equip their applications to control our products in the network, enhancing overall application performance. In return, they provided us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers. More recently, we have worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products, called iApps, that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications. These solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications.

Within the past two years, we have developed partnerships with Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware to provide integrated application services for their Software Defined Networking (SDN) offerings. In addition, we have established partnerships with Microsoft Azure, VMware vCloud Air, Amazon Web Services and many others to provide cloud-based application services and solutions. We plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders.

Leveraging DevCentral, our online community of network architects and developers.

Customization of our TMOS-based products using iRules enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means. To promote the use of iRules, we host an online community, DevCentral, where customers and partners discuss and share the ways in which they use iRules to solve problems and enhance the security, performance and availability of applications. A corollary benefit is that many of the iRules solutions posted by DevCentral participants have become standard features in new releases of TMOS. DevCentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs that guide our product development.



F5 Solutions

Our integrated family of TMOS-based network and application services are available as software modules on our purpose-built hardware, as virtual (software-only) editions or VEs that run on standard hypervisors, and as online services on our Silverline SaaS platform. These products function as strategic points of control in IP networks, inspecting, modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security, availability and delivery of applications and data to any user, anywhere, anytime and on any device. Our Traffix Diameter signaling and routing solutions address the complex needs of service providers and complement our TMOS-based products by enabling fast, reliable communications among the elements of their legacy infrastructures and their evolving packet-based 4G/LTE networks and data centers. We believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their IP networks and data center operations by integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs, enhance productivity and improve service to employees, customers and partners.

Since 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality we offer well beyond the scope of application delivery networking as it has been traditionally defined. Today, we also offer solutions that include application security, secure remote access, firewall protection, WAN optimization, access policy management, carrier grade network address translation, Diameter signaling policy enforcement, and fraud detection, opening up large opportunities in several adjacent markets.

Software

The core of our application delivery technology is TMOS, our Traffic Management Operating System, introduced in September 2004. The full-proxy characteristics of the TMOS architecture enable our products to intercept, inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of IP-enabled application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure, optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on.

Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS)

Since TMOS was launched, we have added thousands of new features designed to interpret and act on specific content in the traffic passing between users and applications. TMOS includes several features and functions that are unique to our products:









•iApps is a set of portable, customizable, reusable templates that enable the rapid and predictable deployment of our products in front of dozens of applications from vendors including Microsoft, Oracle, VMware, Citrix, BEA, and SAP. iApps also allows customers and partners to create templates that simplify the deployment and provisioning of their own applications.

•iCall is a control plane scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly. iCall enables administrators to react to specified data plane events by executing services on the management plane. It can also be used periodically to manage backups or repopulate DNS, or to provide regularly scheduled services such as configuration audits.

•iRules is a powerful, built-in scripting language that enables users to customize how our products intercept, inspect, transform, and direct inbound or outbound application traffic.

•ScaleNis a set of three unique capabilities that enhance the flexibility of our products:

◦Clustered Multiprocessing (CMP) allows customers to cluster and aggregate processors (cores) within BIG-IP appliances or VIPRION chassis products.

◦Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing (vCMP) enables the creation of separate virtual ADCs within an appliance or chassis, each running a separate instance of TMOS with a different configuration and assigned to a different application.

◦Device Service Clustering (DSC) gives customers the ability to group devices and services across an array of ADCs (BIG-IP appliances, VIPRION chassis, or Virtual Editions). Devices can be added to or removed from a DSC without disrupting application services, and application services can be independently managed within the cluster.

TMOS includes features that enhance the ability of our products to protect and hide networks and applications from denial-of-service attacks and other types of security threats. Other enhancements include gateway support for software defined networks (SDN) -- both VXLAN and NVGRE -- symmetrical and asymmetrical application acceleration, subscriber and application aware enforcement for service providers, management and orchestration of multiple devices, and improved visibility that allows customers to monitor and record the performance of applications and users. The latest release of TMOS (BIG-IP 12.0) includes major enhancements that make it easier for customers to transition workloads to cloud environments as needed and incorporate technologies like HTTP/2; extend secure authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) capabilities to cloud-based, web-based, and virtual applications while centrally managing federated identity functions; strengthen protection against sophisticated, high-volume DDoS threats; enable integrated SSL encryption and visibility to manage security certificates and keys across physical, virtual, and cloud deployments.

Software Modules and Virtual Editions

The features and functions embedded in TMOS, support a family of integrated software services that cover a broad range of application-aware network functions from load-balancing to security. These services are available as software modules designed to run on our purpose-built hardware and as software only Virtual Editions designed to run on any standard hypervisor.

•Local Traffic Manager (LTM): LTM provides intelligent load-balancing, traffic management and application health checking.

•BIG-IP DNS (DNS): DNS improves the performance and availability of global applications by intelligently directing users to the closest or best-performing physical, virtual, or cloud environment. In addition, it enhances DNS security by automatically scaling to absorb a rapid increase in queries resulting from a denial-of-service attack and mitigates complex threats from malware and viruses by blocking access to malicious IP domains.

•Link Controller: For organizations with more than one Internet Service Provider (ISP), Link Controller monitors the health and availability of each connection. In the event of a failure, traffic is dynamically directed across other available links so users and external customers stay connected. Link Controller includes an optional compression feature that reduces WAN link bandwidth for lower ISP costs and cuts down on bandwidth bottlenecks for faster application delivery.

•Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): AFM is a high-performance network firewall designed to ensure that traffic isn’t interrupted even under the most intense attacks. AFM scales to support millions of concurrent connections per second and uses the flexibility of iRules, sophisticated filtering, immediate blacklisting, and over a hundred built-in threat vectors to identify and mitigate DDoS attacks. We also offer a carrier-class version of AFM designed to meet the rigorous requirements of an S/Gi firewall in service provider networks.









•Application Security Manager (ASM): ASM is a web application firewall that provides comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection against both generalized and targeted attacks. Combining a positive security model (“deny all unless allowed”) with signature-based detection, ASM can prevent “day-zero” attacks in addition to known security threats.

•Access Policy Manager (APM): APM provides secure, granular, context-aware access to networks and applications while simplifying authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management. Our endpoint security service validates client devices, including personal devices used by employees to access corporate applications and data, to protect organizations from viruses or malware infections, accidental data loss, and rogue device access. This allows users to apply repeatable access policies across many devices, networks, applications and servers with centralized visibility of their authorization infrastructure.

•Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): AAM combines the application delivery features previously available in WAN Optimization Manager (WOM) and WebAccelerator. AAM overcomes network, protocol, and application issues to help meet application performance, data replication, and disaster recovery requirements presented by cloud, mobile applications, and video distribution, decreasing the need for additional bandwidth and hardware and giving users fast access to applications.

•Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT): CGNAT offers a broad set of tools that enables service providers to successfully migrate to IPv6 while continuing to support and interoperate with existing IPv4 devices and content. BIG-IP CGNAT offers service providers tunneling solutions with Dual-Stack Lite capabilities as well as native network address translation solutions such as NAT44 and NAT64. It provides carrier-grade scalability by offering a very high number of IP address translations, very fast NAT translation setup rates, high throughput, and high-speed logging.

•Policy Enforcement Manager (PEM): PEM offers service providers a comprehensive set of traffic classification capabilities to accurately identify the specific applications and services subscribers are using and how they’re using them. This information allows them to steer application and subscriber traffic to the most appropriate value-added services (such as web caching, video optimization, or parental control) and reduce the burden on other services. PEM also provides deep reporting, enabling service providers to build tailored services and packages based on subscribers’ application usage and traffic classification.

Cloud-Based Subscription Services

•Silverline is a SaaS platform that allows customers to subscribe to application services running on our own high-performance, massively-scalable hardware in cloud-based points of presence around the globe. Two services are currently available on Silverline: DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF). Depending on the level of protection they require, customers can route traffic through Silverline 24/7 or only when an attack is detected. For customers who want to minimize the upfront costs and expense of maintaining on-premise solutions, these services are an easy and affordable alternative. For large enterprises, subscribing to these services in conjunction with our on-premise DDoS solution (AFM) and application firewall (ASM) can provide a first line of defense against attacks before they reach the data center.

Other Subscription Services

•WebSafe and MobileSafe are software modules that inject code into traffic between a large enterprise, such as a major financial institution, and its online customers or clients. The code is then downloaded transparently onto the client device and provides real-time protection against malware, phishing, and other cyberthreats, including fraud, without any impact to the user experience. WebSafe protects against all web-based threat types, and MobileSafe protects against advanced threats targeting the mobile user.

•Secure Web Gateway Services is a function of APM that protects enterprises against both inbound and outbound malware. Integrated with cloud-based threat intelligence provided by Websense, Secure Web Gateway enables enterprises to manage user access to websites, as well as to hundreds of web-based applications, protocols, and videos, ensuring adherence to corporate acceptable use policies, and compliance regulations.

•IP Intelligence uses contextual awareness and analysis of traffic and constantly refreshed data from a global threat-sensor network to block threats from a dynamic set of high-risk IP addresses.

Diameter Signaling and Routing

•Traffix Signaling Delivery Controller: The Diameter signaling protocol is a de facto standard adopted by service providers to deal with the massive increase in signaling traffic that has accompanied the mobile industry’s transition to 4G/LTE networks. The Traffix Signaling Delivery Controller (SDC) is a software platform consolidating Traffix’s widely deployed Diameter Gateway, Diameter Load Balancer and Diameter Router solutions to deliver cost-effective connectivity, scalability









and control to service providers migrating from legacy infrastructures to LTE and IMS networks. Traffix SDC solutions include interoperability of legacy and next-generation networks, mobile and fixed elements, and all third-party vendors.

Hardware

All of our purpose-built hardware products are designed to enhance the performance of our software. Currently we offer two types of hardware configurations: BIG-IP appliances; and our chassis-based VIPRION products. Both BIG-IP and VIPRION run TMOS and support all of our product software modules. We also sell specialty appliances that integrate specific software services and are only available as standalone products.

Data sheets for all of our hardware platforms are available in the products section of our website.

BIG-IP Appliances

Products in our family of BIG-IP Application Delivery Controllers differ primarily in their performance characteristics resulting from the hardware components and configurations that make up each system. Our current line of BIG-IP appliances includes BIG-IP 2000 series, BIG-IP 4000 series, BIG-IP 5000 series, BIG-IP 7000 series, BIG-IP 10000 series and BIG-IP 12000 series.

VIPRION Chassis-Based Systems

Currently we offer four chassis-based systems: VIPRION 4800, VIPRION 4480, VIPRION 2400 and VIPRION 2200. VIPRION’s unique architecture distributes traffic across all available processors and allows customers to add or remove blades without disrupting traffic. It also helps customers simplify their networks by consolidating ADCs, saving management costs as well as power, space, and cooling in the datacenter.

Management and Orchestration

•BIG-IQ is an intelligent management framework that simplifies the process of deploying and optimizing our application delivery services. Analogous to TMOS, BIG-IQ is a software platform designed to support multiple management modules. Currently we offer three BIG-IQ modules:

◦BIG-IQ Device lets customers manage all their F5 systems and VEs across their entire infrastructure. BIG-IQ Device provides device inventory, status, backups, updates, upgrades and license management from a single management console.

◦BIG-IQ Orchestrator automates and orchestrates the deployment of application delivery services on F5 products across traditional data centers or public, private, and hybrid cloud infrastructures, enabling customers to deploy and manage application delivery services in a fast, consistent, and repeatable manner, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

◦BIG-IQ Security consolidates firewall policy management across multiple Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM) devices, reducing IT overhead and increasing operational scalability by letting customers create new firewall policies, modify existing policies, push policy changes to selected firewall devices and monitor the effectiveness of each device from a single point of control.

BIG-IQ is designed with an industry leading and open set of API’s, which integrates with northbound orchestrators such as OpenStack, Cisco’s ACI, Microsoft’s SCVMM and VMware’s NSX, VCAC and VCO allowing greater flexibility in supporting hyper-converged data centers and infrastructure.



Product Development

We believe our future success depends on our ability to maintain technology leadership by continuing to improve our products and by developing new products to meet the changing needs of our customers. Our product development organization, which includes product management and marketing, employs a standard process for the development, documentation and quality control of software and systems that is designed to meet these goals. This process includes working with our business development and marketing teams, customers and partners to identify new or improved solutions that meet the evolving needs of our addressable markets.

Our principal software engineering team is located at our headquarters in Seattle, Washington. Product development for APM and PEM is located in San Jose, California. ASM, Traffix SDC and Versafe product development is located in Tel Aviv, Israel. Our hardware engineering team is located in Spokane, Washington, San Jose and Tel Aviv. In addition, we recently opened a dedicated facility for product testing and quality control in Warsaw, Poland.









Members of all our product development teams collaborate closely with one another to ensure the interoperability and performance of our hardware and software systems. In fiscal year 2015, approximately93 percentof our product development organization was engaged in software development.

During the fiscal years endedSeptember 30, 2015,2014and2013, we had research and product development expenses of$296.6 million,$263.8 million, and$209.6 million, respectively.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global 1000 companies, including those in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing and healthcare, along with government customers. In fiscal year2015, sales outside of the Americas represented42.7%of our net revenues. Refer to Note 9 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area.

Sales and Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels, including distributors, value-added resellers (VARs) and systems integrators. A substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year2015was derived from these channel sales. Our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts.

F5 sales teams.Our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them, as necessary, in the sale of our products and services to their customers. We also sell our products and services directly to customers, primarily large enterprises, whose accounts are managed by our major account services team. Field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing pre-sale technical resources as needed.

Distributors and VARs.As a key component of our sales strategy, we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors, local and specialized distributors and VARs. We derive a majority of our product sales from VARs and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment.

Our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements.

For fiscal year2015, sales to four of our worldwide distributors, Westcon Group, Inc., Ingram Micro, Inc., Avnet Technology Solutions, and Arrow ECS represented17.6%,16.1%,13.8%and10.4%of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with these distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term. The agreements grant Westcon Group, Inc., Ingram Micro, Inc., Avnet Technology Solutions, and Arrow ECS the right to distribute our products to resellers, with no minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators.We also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators, including Dell Services, HP Enterprise Services and IBM Global Services, who include our products as core components of application or network-based solutions they deploy for their customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance.

Resellers and Technology Partners. Historically, our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors. Currently we partner with Dell and Hewlett-Packard, who resell our products, and with other large technology companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, VMware and Cisco, who recommend our products to their customers. Management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team, which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market.









Marketing

Our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs. In line with this belief, our marketing organization works directly with customers, partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position.

To support the growing number of developers using our products, including network and application architects, we continue to promote and expand DevCentral, our on-line community website that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using iRules and iCall. A key aspect of DevCentral is an on-line forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with iRules and iCall. At the end of fiscal year2015, DevCentral had more than223,000registered members.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products. These include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners, and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products, business relationships and technology partnerships. In addition, we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years2015and2014, we had product backlog of approximately$38.1 millionand$61.6 million, respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers. Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.



Customer Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that include installation, phone support, hardware repair and replacement, software updates, online tools, consulting and training services.

We provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services personnel also provide on-site installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates, software error correction releases, hardware repair and replacement, and, in the majority of cases, round-the-clock call center support. Free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract. We also offer an online, automated, self-help customer support function called “Ask F5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions, allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk. This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent level. We also offer an online service called iHealth, which allows customers to diagnose up-to-the-minute snapshots of their BIG-IP systems. Diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects, a description of the issue, recommendations for resolution, and a link to further information in the AskF5™ Knowledge Base.

F5 offers training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products, including local and wide area network system administration and management. We have a complete certification program that qualifies our partners and customers for having the appropriate skills to implement and use the functionality of our products. To provide our customers with onsite and remote help, we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services, including comprehensive network management, documentation and performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements.









Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications.

Our purpose-built systems are manufactured by Flextronics International LTD. Subcontracting activity at Flextronics encompasses prototype builds, full production and direct fulfillment. Flextronics also performs the following activities on our behalf; material procurement, PCB assembly and test, final assembly, system test, quality control, direct shipment and warranty repairs. We provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials, plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand. Flextronics procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast, assembles the products and tests them according to our specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, value-added resellers, or end users. Generally, we do not own the components. Title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location. If the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers. However, some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source.

Certain sub-assembly and testing processes of our products are performed at Flextronics' facility in Zhuhai, China. The majority of our sub-assemblies are shipped to Flextronics' Milpitas, California plant for configuration and final testing and eventual distribution to our end users. We also have capabilities to complete this process for some of our products in Flextronics' Zhuhai, China plant for distribution to APAC and Japan end users.

Competition

The expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities, many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as Gartner Group, Dell’Oro and others. In addition to server load-balancing, traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery, our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security, WAN optimization, application acceleration, policy management, and Diameter signaling and routing, where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional ADC vendors. The ability to create custom network services using iRules, iControl and iCall has also enabled us, our customers, and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no off-the-shelf solution. As a result, we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features, functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products.

Within the more narrowly defined traditional ADC market, several companies sell server load-balancing products. These include Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., Citrix Systems, Inc. and a number of smaller competitors: Radware Ltd, A10 Networks, Array Networks, Inc., and Barracuda Networks, Inc.

In related ADC markets we compete with the following:

•Cisco, Juniper Networks and Checkpoint Systems in the network firewall market;

•Cisco, Imperva and Citrix in the web application firewall market;

•Cisco, Juniper and A10 in Carrier Grade NAT;

•Procera, Allot, Sandvine and other DPI vendors with our PEM offerings;

•Oracle via the acquisition of Tekelec and Acme Packet in the Diameter signaling market;

•IBM in end-user protection against malware, phishing and other cyberthreats;

•Akamai Networks in cloud-based DDoS protection; and

•Blue Coat Systems in protecting enterprises from inbound and outbound malware.

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance, customer support, brand recognition, the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing. Certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. However, because of the superior









performance, broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products, which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness, we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We have obtained254patents in the United States,21foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology. Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources into our products. These are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination. While we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future, we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally.
