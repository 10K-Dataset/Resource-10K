General

F5 Networks is the leading developer and provider of software-defined application services. These services deliver our customers with the most secure, fast and reliable applications to any user, anywhere, anytime. Our core technology is a full-proxy, programmable, massively-scalable software platform called TMOS (Traffic Management Operating System).

Introduced in 2004, the TMOS platform supports the industry’s broadest array of features and functions designed to ensure that applications accessible over Internet Protocol (IP) networks are secure, fast and available. Our TMOS-based application services include local and global traffic management, network and application security, access management, web acceleration and a number of other network and application services. These services are available as software modules that can run individually or as part of an integrated solution on our high-performance, scalable, purpose-built BIG-IP appliances and chassis-based VIPRION systems, or as software-only Virtual Editions that run on all major hypervisors. In conjunction with our BIG-IQ management software, the availability of our products as both hardware-based and software-only solutions gives customers the flexibility to create a dynamic control plane infrastructure tailored to the specific demands of private and public clouds as well as traditional data centers.

The core features and functions of TMOS enable our products to inspect and modify the content of IP traffic flows between users and applications and support a broad and growing array of services. iRules, a scripting language based on Tool Command Language (TCL), is a unique feature of TMOS that enables customers and third parties to write customized rules to inspect and modify traffic. TMOS also has an open software interface called iControl, which allows our products to communicate with one another and with third-party products, and a scripting framework called iCall that lets users define data









plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly. TMOS is designed to support the addition of new functionality as software modules and to exploit the performance-enhancing features of our purpose-built hardware.

Our hardware products include our BIG-IP family of appliances and our line of scalable VIPRION systems. These purpose-built devices integrate industry-standard components, such as general-purpose processors and FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays), with components we design ourselves. The architecture of these systems is designed to accelerate and optimize the performance of our software by offloading repetitive, compute-intensive functions such as encryption and compression to specific components, and enabling complex application-layer processing at network speed. Typically deployed in front of web and application servers, our hardware products deliver massive performance and scalability that enable customers to consolidate multiple application services on a single device. This eliminates the need for separate point products, which are often difficult and costly to integrate and manage and reduces the load on servers by offloading functions that might otherwise run on the servers themselves. Offloading functions from servers reduces the number of servers needed to run specific applications, lowers the cost of power and cooling, and drives down operating costs by simplifying the management of servers and applications. In virtual environments, this allows customers to increase the density of virtual servers and reduces the added complexity of managing a dynamic environment.

As information technology infrastructures continue to evolve, there is growing demand for software-only application services that can be deployed in virtual environments next to each instance of an application. For customers who prefer this option, our Virtual Edition (VE) products offer faster throughput than competing products and the broadest array of integrated application services available. We sell individual VE versions of all modules available on our hardware-based solutions which provide the same software services and include all of the features and functions embedded in TMOS.

While VEs have lower performance than our hardware-based solutions, they give customers the flexibility to deploy a mix of integrated application services as needed, spinning them up and down with each instance of an application, and moving them with the application between traditional data centers and private or public clouds. Both VEs and hardware-based services can be and increasingly are deployed in hybrid infrastructures within data centers and private clouds, across multiple data centers, and across data centers and public clouds. Our BIG-IQ management platform supports an array of software modules that enable customers to manage all of the services running in these hybrid environments from a single management console.

In addition to our TMOS-based products, we offer other closely-related products that facilitate, enhance, or extend our application services.

Our Traffix family of Diameter signaling and routing products, acquired in February 2012, offers the most advanced, robust and cost-effective solution for Diameter routing, load balancing and gateway connectivity, enabling service providers to meet the multiple challenges associated with the growth of mobile data.

LineRate software-defined application services, acquired in early 2013, address the growing demand for network functions virtualization (NFV) and network service virtualization (NSV) by enabling application developers and network operators (DevOps) to rapidly create and deploy complex networking functions that help scale, manage, and optimize their applications.

More recent acquisitions include technologies that complement and expand our Security offerings. Versafe software products (WebSafe and MobileSafe), acquired in September 2013, provide real-time protection against malware, phishing, and other cyber-threats aimed at mobile devices and web applications. Defense.Net, acquired last May, is a cloud-based service that provides highly scalable protection against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks and complements our existing on-premise DDoS protection capabilities.

Another recent addition to our Security offerings, Secure Web Gateway Services is integrated with Websense cloud-based services to protect enterprises against inbound and outbound malware. In addition, F5 provides a threat intelligence feed, called IP Intelligence (IPI), by leveraging Webroot’s BrightCloud honeypots, sensors and endpoints all across the Internet which aggregate millions of malicious addresses into a reputation database. WebSafe, MobileSafe, Defense.Net, Secure Web Gateway Services and IP Intelligence are all sold on a subscription basis.

In connection with our products, we offer a broad range of services including consulting, training, installation, maintenance and other technical support services.

Industry Background

Growth and Evolution of IP-Based Infrastructures

Internet Protocol (IP) is a communications language used to transmit data over the Internet. For more than two decades, large business and government organizations have been gradually replacing older data center architectures with IP-based infrastructures, deploying new IP-based applications and replacing or upgrading legacy applications with new IP-enabled versions. At the same time, organizations have become more geographically dispersed, and increasingly mobile workforces depend on access to corporate applications and data from remote locations and a variety of client devices including smartphones, tablets and laptops.

In recent years, the information technology landscape has changed dramatically as organizations have responded to the slowdown in the global economy by using technologies such as virtualization, software defined networking and the growing availability and sophistication of cloud computing to reduce capital and operating costs and enhance the flexibility and efficiency of their information infrastructures. These efforts are reflected in the ongoing trend toward data center consolidation that includes a reduction in the number and size of data centers, as well as the number and variety of hardware devices. In addition, a growing number of organizations are turning to social networking and other online vehicles to help target customers and compete more effectively in an environment of reduced consumer spending.

Emergence of the Dynamic Data Center

In addition to preventing the threat of attacks designed to disrupt, destroy or block access to network applications, organizations are faced with the equally daunting challenge of controlling access to applications and data. The proliferation of mobile devices has given users with smart phones, tablets, and laptops the ability to access corporate private and public data centers from virtually anywhere. This, in turn, has increased the difficulty of ensuring that mobile users are able to access applications and data for which they are authorized, and that applications and data are protected from access by unauthorized users.

Need to Optimize the Secure Delivery of Applications and Data

With the ongoing evolution and increasing complexity of IT infrastructures, there is a growing need to optimize the secure delivery of applications and data over IP networks. IP-based traffic passing between end-user devices and servers is divided into discrete packets that travel by multiple routes to their destination where they are reassembled. The disassembly, routing, and reassembly of transmissions are relatively straightforward and require little intelligence. By contrast, managing, inspecting, modifying, redirecting and securing application traffic going to and from servers requires intelligent systems capable of performing a broad array of functions. Broadly speaking, all of those functions are aspects of application delivery.

Application Delivery Controllers, or ADCs, dynamically manage the flow of traffic between users and servers (physical or virtual), making multiple servers look like a single resource to the user. In addition they free up resources by offloading









Although application delivery services are broadly applicable within enterprise and service provider IT infrastructures, the latter face unique challenges as they attempt to modernize and scale their networks to deal with the flood of data generated by smart phones, tablets, wearables and other mobile devices. To cope with these challenges, service providers are migrating legacy 2G/3G infrastructures to 4G/LTE networks and Evolved Packet Core (EPC) data centers that require an array of network and application services. Today, most of those services are deployed on separate appliances from different vendors. Apart from the associated capital costs, integrating and managing multiple devices entail significant operating expense, and service providers are actively seeking solutions that will enable them to lower costs and improve reliability and performance by consolidating services and reducing the number of devices. To cope with the dramatic increase in signaling traffic associated with 4G/LTE networks and the multi-vendor technology interoperability challenges, service providers have also adopted the Diameter signaling protocol as the de facto standard for communication within their evolving data center infrastructure. Diameter signaling solutions offer unprecedented scalability, reliability, and performance on a single, carrier-grade, purpose-built platform.

F5’s Strategy

Our goal is to lead the industry in providing application and network services that ensure the safe, fast and reliable delivery of applications to any user, anywhere, anytime. Those services include availability, security, performance, mobility, and identity. They also include managing and orchestrating resources, as well as coordinating services across multiple data centers and networks. Our products are designed to be strategic points of control in the IT infrastructure that allow business policies to be implemented where information is exchanged. This enables organizations to respond quickly to changing business needs, improve costly and time consuming business processes and develop new sources of revenue through highly differentiated offerings. Key components of our strategy include:

Offering a complete, integrated application delivery product suite.

Since the introduction of TMOS, we have developed TMOS-based versions of our own legacy products, such as Local Traffic Manager (LTM), Global Traffic Manager (GTM) and Link Controller; new products, such as Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM), Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT) and Policy Enforcement Manager (PEM), that leverage the unique performance characteristics of our hardware and software architecture; and products that incorporate acquired technology, including Application Security Manager (ASM), Application Acceleration Manager (AAM), Access Policy Manager (APM) and two of our newest security offerings, WebSafe and MobileSafe. All of these products are currently available as integrated software modules on our BIG-IP and VIPRION hardware and as Virtual Editions that run on any standard server or hypervisor. We believe this approach sharply differentiates our products from our competitors’ offerings and provides customers with an expanding array of integrated application delivery solutions that can be customized to meet their specific needs.

Investing in technology to meet evolving customer needs.

We continue to invest in research and development to provide our customers with comprehensive, integrated application delivery services. Our product development efforts leverage the unique attributes of our TMOS platform to deliver new features and functions that address the complex, changing needs of our customers. Although the bulk of our investment is software development, concurrent development of tightly integrated, high-performance hardware is a key part of our investment strategy. We also look for opportunities to acquire technologies that will enable us to broaden the scope of our offerings and expand into adjacent markets.









Expanding our addressable market.

Continuing to build and expand relationships with strategic technology partners.

To enhance our competitiveness in large accounts, we have developed strategic technology partnerships with enterprise software vendors, such as Microsoft, Oracle, VMware and others, who have an established presence in those accounts. By taking advantage of iControl, our open application programming interface, and iCall, a scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly, these vendors can equip their applications to control our products in the network, enhancing overall application performance. In return, they provide us significant leverage in the selling process by recommending our products to their customers. We have also worked closely with several of these vendors to develop configurations of our products, called iApps, that are specifically designed to simplify deployment and optimize the performance of their applications. These solutions are available as templates which allow quick and easy configuration of our products for specific applications.

During the past year we have entered into partnerships with Cisco, HP, Microsoft and VMware to provide integrated application services for their Software Defined Networking (SDN) offerings. In addition, we have established partnerships with Microsoft Azure, VMware vCloud Air, Amazon Web Services and many others to provide cloud-based application services and solutions. We plan to continue building on our existing relationships and to extend our competitive edge by developing new strategic partnerships with other technology leaders.

Leveraging DevCentral, our online community of network architects and developers.

Customization of our TMOS-based products using iRules and our LineRate technology with node.js enhances their “stickiness” by allowing customers to solve problems in both their applications and their networks that would be difficult if not impossible to solve by other means. To promote the use of iRules and node.js, we host an online community, DevCentral, where network architects and developers can discuss and share the ways in which they use iRules and node.js to solve problems and enhance the security, performance and availability of applications. A corollary benefit is that many of the iRules solutions posted by DevCentral participants have become standard features in new releases of TMOS. DevCentral also provides a valuable window into our customers’ constantly evolving needs.



F5 Solutions

Our integrated family of TMOS-based network and application services is comprised of software products that run on purpose-built hardware and are also available as virtual (software-only) editions or VEs. These products function as strategic points of control in IP networks, inspecting, modifying and directing traffic to optimize the security, availability and delivery of applications and data to any user, anywhere, anytime. Our LineRate technology supports similar functionality in software-only solutions designed to meet the specialized needs of software-defined data centers. Our Traffix Diameter signaling and routing devices address the complex needs of service providers by enabling fast, reliable communications among the elements of their legacy infrastructures and their evolving packet-based 4G/LTE networks and data centers. We believe our products offer the most intelligent services and advanced functionality in the marketplace along with performance and flexibility that enable organizations to simplify management of their IP networks and data center operations by integrating disparate resources to reduce operating costs, enhance productivity and improve service to employees, customers and partners.









Application Delivery

Since 2004 we have expanded the breadth of features and functionality we offer well beyond the scope of application delivery networking as it has been traditionally defined. Today, we also offer solutions that include application security, secure remote access, firewall protection, WAN optimization, access policy management, carrier grade network address translation, Diameter signaling policy enforcement, and fraud detection opening up large opportunities in several adjacent markets. Many of the features and functions that differentiate our products are built into TMOS, our full-proxy operating system. Others are available as software modules that run on TMOS or as Virtual Editions, and some of our newer security services are available by subscription.

Software

The core of our application delivery technology is TMOS, our Traffic Management Operating System, introduced in September 2004. The full-proxy characteristics of the TMOS architecture enable our products to intercept, inspect and act on the contents of traffic from virtually every type of IP-enabled application. In addition, the modularity of the TMOS architecture allows us to deliver tightly integrated solutions that secure, optimize and ensure the availability of applications and the networks they run on.

Traffic Management Operating System (TMOS)

Since TMOS was launched, we have added hundreds of new features designed to interpret and act on specific content in the traffic passing between users and applications. TMOS includes several features and functions that are unique to our products:

•iApps is a set of portable, customizable, reusable templates that enable the rapid and predictable deployment of our products in front of dozens of applications from vendors including Microsoft, Oracle, VMware, Citrix, BEA, and SAP. iApps also allows customers and partners to create templates that simplify the deployment and provisioning of their own applications.

•iCall is a control plane scripting framework that provides the ability to define data plane events such as threshold breaches and adjust the behavior of our products accordingly. iCall enables administrators to react to specified data plane events by executing services on the management plane. It can also be used periodically to manage backups or repopulate DNS, or to provide regularly scheduled services such as configuration audits.

•ScaleNis a set of three unique capabilities that enhance the flexibility of our products:

◦Clustered Multiprocessing (CMP) allows customers to cluster and aggregate processors (cores) within BIG-IP appliances or VIPRION chassis products.

◦Virtual Clustered Multiprocessing (vCMP) enables the creation of separate virtual ADCs within an appliance or chassis, each running a separate instance of TMOS with a different configuration and assigned to a different application.

◦Device Service Clustering (DSC) gives customers the ability to group devices and services across an array of ADCs (BIG-IP appliances, VIPRION chassis, or Virtual Editions). Devices can be added to or removed from a DSC without disrupting application services, and application services can be independently managed within the cluster.

TMOS also includes a number of new security features that enhance the ability of our products to protect and hide networks and applications from denial of service attacks and other types of security threats. Other enhancements include gateway support for software defined networks (SDN) -- both VXLAN and NVGRE -- symmetrical and asymmetrical application acceleration, subscriber and application aware enforcement for service providers, management and orchestration of multiple devices, and improved visibility that allows customers to monitor and record the performance of applications and users.

Product Modules

In addition to the features and functions embedded in TMOS, we offer a family of integrated software solutions that cover a broad range of application-aware network functions from load-balancing to security. Depending on a number of factors, including the hardware platform they have purchased, the application they are running, and their performance and security requirements, customers may purchase one or more of these modules in addition to Local Traffic Manager (LTM), which is included with every product. The following software modules are currently available on all BIG-IP and VIPRION products except BIG-IP 2000:









•Local Traffic Manager (LTM): LTM, which provides intelligent load-balancing and traffic management, is standard on all BIG-IP appliances, VIPRION chassis-based systems and Virtual Editions. As a strategic point of control between applications and users, LTM manages the flow and distribution of all traffic passing through our products, ensuring that applications are secure, fast and available.

•Global Traffic Manager (GTM): GTM automatically directs users to the closest or best-performing data center based on business policy, geolocation, and volume spikes, regardless of their cause. When users try to access a data center that is overloaded or unreachable, GTM automatically and seamlessly directs them to a secondary data center. It also automates the process of tracking and managing interdependencies among individual services in distributed applications. In addition, GTM enhances DNS security by automatically scaling to absorb a rapid increase in queries resulting from a denial of service attack.

•Link Controller: For organizations with more than one Internet Service Provider (ISP), Link Controller monitors the health and availability of each connection. In the event of a failure, traffic is dynamically directed across other available links so users and external customers stay connected. Link Controller includes an optional compression feature that reduces WAN link bandwidth for lower ISP costs and cuts down on bandwidth bottlenecks for faster application delivery.

•Advanced Firewall Manager (AFM): AFM is a high-performance, stateful, full-proxy network firewall designed to guard data centers against incoming threats that enter the network on the most widely deployed protocols-including HTTP/S, SMTP, DNS, and FTP. By aligning firewall policies with the applications they protect, AFM streamlines application deployment, security, and monitoring.

•Application Security Manager (ASM): ASM is an application firewall that provides comprehensive, proactive, application-layer protection against both generalized and targeted attacks. Combining a positive security model (“deny all unless allowed”) with signature-based detection, ASM can prevent “day-zero” attacks in addition to known security threats.

•Access Policy Manager (APM): APM provides secure, granular, context-aware access to networks and applications while simplifying authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) management. Our endpoint security service validates client devices, including personal devices used by employees to access corporate applications and data, to protect organizations from viruses or malware infections, accidental data loss, and rogue device access. This allows users to apply repeatable access policies across many devices, networks, applications and servers with centralized visibility of their authorization infrastructure.

•Application Acceleration Manager (AAM): AAM combines the application delivery features previously available in WAN Optimization Manager (WOM) and WebAccelerator. AAM overcomes network, protocol, and application issues to help meet application performance, data replication, and disaster recovery requirements presented by cloud, mobile applications, and video distribution, decreasing the need for additional bandwidth and hardware and giving users fast access to applications.

•Carrier-Grade Network Address Translation (CGNAT): CGNAT offers a broad set of tools that enables service providers to successfully migrate to IPv6 while continuing to support and interoperate with existing IPv4 devices and content. BIG-IP CGNAT offers service providers tunneling solutions with Dual-Stack Lite capabilities as well as native network address translation solutions such as NAT44 and NAT64. It provides carrier-grade scalability by offering a very high number of IP address translations, very fast NAT translation setup rates, high throughput, and high-speed logging.

•Policy Enforcement Manager (PEM): PEM offers service providers a comprehensive set of traffic classification capabilities to accurately identify the specific applications and services subscribers are using and how they’re using them. This information allows them to steer application and subscriber traffic to the most appropriate value-added services (such as web caching, video optimization, or parental control) and reduce the burden on other services. PEM also provides deep reporting, enabling service providers to build tailored services and packages based on subscribers’ application usage and traffic classification.

Virtual ADCs

All of our product modules are also available as software-only Virtual Editions (VEs), designed to run on all major hypervisors. Production VEs are deployed in public and private clouds and supplement our hardware products in hybrid environments. Trial versions give our customers a cost-effective way to test and configure our products and help determine which systems and modules will best meet their specific needs in production environments.

NFV and NSV Products

Our LineRate products address the growing demand for network functions virtualization (NFV) and network service virtualization (NSV) by providing application developers and network operators with tools to leverage a vast library of open-









source services that run on standard hypervisors and commodity servers. Using the power and flexibility of node.js, a server-side version of JavaScript, LineRate products enable developers and operations personnel (DevOps) to rapidly create and deploy a broad range of complex networking functions that help scale, manage, and optimize their applications.

Software as a Service

Among our newest security offerings, WebSafe and MobileSafe are software modules that inject code into traffic between servers and end-user devices which is then downloaded transparently to the device and provides real-time protection against malware, phishing, and other cyberthreats, including fraud without any impact to the user experience. As their names imply, WebSafe protects against all web-based threat types, and MobileSafe protects against advanced threats targeting the mobile user. Defense.Net, our most recent acquisition and our newest Security offering, is a cloud-based service that provides highly scalable protection against DDoS attacks. Deployed in conjunction with our massively-scalable on-premise DDoS protection, Defense.Net provides a first line of defense against attacks before they reach a customer’s data center. Another recent addition to our Security offerings, Secure Web Gateway Services protects enterprises against both inbound and outbound malware. Integrated with cloud-based threat intelligence provided by Websense, Secure Web Gateway enables enterprises to manage user access to websites, as well as to hundreds of web-based applications, protocols, and videos, ensuring adherence to corporate acceptable use policies, and compliance regulations. All three services are sold to customers on a subscription basis.

Hardware

All of our purpose-built hardware products are designed to enhance the performance of our software. Currently we offer two types of hardware configurations: BIG-IP appliances; and our chassis-based VIPRION products. Both BIG-IP and VIPRION run TMOS and support all of our product software modules. We also sell specialty appliances that integrate specific software services and are only available as standalone products.

Data sheets for all of our hardware platforms are available in the products section of our website.

BIG-IP Appliances

Products in our family of BIG-IP Application Delivery Controllers differ primarily in their performance characteristics resulting from the hardware components and configurations that make up each system.

Customers

Our customers include a wide variety of enterprises and service providers among Fortune 1000 and Business Week Global 1000 companies, including those in technology, telecommunications, financial services, transportation, education, manufacturing and healthcare, along with government customers. In fiscal year2014, sales outside of the Americas represented









43.1%of our net revenues. Refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our revenues by geographic area.

Sales and Marketing

Sales

We sell our products and services to large enterprise customers and service providers through a variety of channels, including distributors, value-added resellers (VARs) and systems integrators. A substantial amount of our revenue for fiscal year2014was derived from these channel sales. Our sales teams work closely with our channel partners and also sell our products and services directly to major accounts.

Early in fiscal 2014, we introduced new pricing options for our hardware and software designed to simplify the sales process and provide incentives for customers to purchase more of our software products. Good, Better, Best (GBB) is a tiered licensing model that is available for our BIG-IP appliances, VIPRION chassis products, and Virtual Editions (VEs).

•Good is our basic traffic management option that includes BIG-IP LTM along with the full suite of features and functions available on TMOS. Additional software modules can be purchased at the list price for each module or VE.

•Better includes three modules or VEs (GTM, AAM and AFM) in addition to LTM at a discount to what they would cost if each were purchased separately.

•Best includes GTM, AAM and AFM plus our two most popular software products, ASM and APM, also at a discount to what they would cost if purchased separately.

Pricing for the modules scales with the size of the system purchased. During the last three quarters of fiscal 2014, we saw strong and growing demand for GBB from both our customers and channel partners.

Also in early fiscal 2014, we introduced a utility pricing model that allows customers of Amazon Web Services and other public cloud providers to rent VEs by the hour or day, allowing them to deploy our products on a pay-as-they-go basis.

F5 sales teams.Our inside sales team generates and qualifies leads for regional sales managers and helps manage accounts by serving as a liaison between the field and internal corporate resources. Our field sales personnel are located in major cities in four sales regions: the Americas (primarily the United States); Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA); Japan; and the Asia Pacific region (APAC). Field sales personnel work closely with our channel partners to assist them, as necessary, in the sale of our products and services to their customers. We also sell our products and services directly to customers, primarily large enterprises, whose accounts are managed by our major account services team. Field systems engineers support our regional sales managers and channel partners by participating in joint sales calls and providing pre-sale technical resources as needed.

Distributors and VARs.As a key component of our sales strategy, we have established relationships with a number of large national and international distributors, local and specialized distributors and VARs. We derive a majority of our product sales from VARs and rely on our large distributors primarily for fulfillment.

Our agreements with these channel partners are not exclusive and do not prevent them from selling competitive products. These agreements typically have terms of one year with no obligation to renew, and typically do not provide for exclusive sales territories or minimum purchase requirements.

For fiscal year2014, sales to three of our worldwide distributors, Avnet Technology Solutions, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Westcon Group, Inc. represented14.0%,17.4%and14.5%of our total revenues, respectively. Our agreements with these distributors are standard, non-exclusive distribution agreements that renew automatically on an annual basis and generally can be terminated by either party with 30 days written notice prior to the start of any renewal term. The agreements grant Avnet Technology Solutions, Ingram Micro, Inc. and Westcon Group, Inc. the right to distribute our products to resellers in North America and certain other territories internationally, with no minimum purchase requirements.

Systems integrators.We also market our products through strategic relationships with systems integrators, including Dell Services, HP Enterprise Services and IBM Global Services, who include our products as core components of application or network-based solutions they deploy for their customers. In most cases, systems integrators do not directly purchase our products for resale to their customers. Instead they typically recommend our products as part of broader solutions, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) or customer relationship management (CRM) solutions that incorporate our products for high availability and enhanced performance.

Resellers and Technology Partners. Historically, our ability to compete with much larger companies has been strengthened through partnerships with large systems and software vendors. Currently we partner with Dell and Hewlett-Packard, who resell our products, and with other large technology companies, including Microsoft, Oracle, VMware and Cisco,









who recommend our products to their customers. Management of these relationships is the responsibility of our business development team, a component of our marketing organization, which closely monitors technology companies in adjacent and complementary markets for opportunities to partner with those whose solutions are complementary to ours and could enable us to expand our addressable market.

Marketing

Our marketing strategy is driven by the belief that our continued success depends on our ability to understand and anticipate the dynamic needs of our addressable markets and to develop valuable solutions that meet those needs. In line with this belief, our marketing organization works directly with customers, partners and our product development teams to identify and create innovative solutions to further enhance our leadership position.

To support the growing number of developers using our products, including network and application architects, we continue to promote and expand DevCentral, our on-line community website that provides technical resources to customers, prospects and partners wanting to extend and optimize F5 solutions using iRules and iCall. A key aspect of DevCentral is an on-line forum where developers as well as application and network architects discuss and share solutions they have written with iRules and iCall. At the end of fiscal year2014, DevCentral had more than165,000registered members.

We also engage in a number of marketing programs and initiatives aimed at promoting our brand and creating market awareness of our technology and products. These include actively participating in industry trade shows and joint marketing events with channel and technology partners, and briefing industry analysts and members of the trade press on our latest products, business relationships and technology partnerships. In addition, we market our products to chief information officers and other information technology professionals through targeted advertising, direct mail and high-profile Web events.

Backlog

At the end of fiscal years2014and2013, we had product backlog of approximately$61.6 millionand$57.9 million, respectively. Backlog represents orders confirmed with a purchase order for products to be shipped generally within 90 days to customers with approved credit status. Orders are subject to cancellation, rescheduling by customers or product specification changes by customers. Although we believe that the backlog orders are firm, purchase orders may be cancelled by the customer prior to shipment without significant penalty. For this reason, we believe that our product backlog at any given date is not a reliable indicator of future revenues.



Customer Service and Technical Support

We believe that our ability to provide consistent, high-quality customer service and technical support is a key factor in attracting and retaining large enterprise customers. Accordingly, we offer a broad range of support services that include installation, phone support, hardware repair and replacement, software updates, online tools, consulting and training services.

We provide these services directly to end users and also utilize a multi-tiered support model, leveraging the capabilities of our channel partners when applicable. Our technical support staff is strategically located in regional service centers to support our global customer base.

Prior to the installation of our products, our services personnel work with customers to analyze their network needs and determine the best way to deploy our products and configure product features and functions to meet those needs. Our services personnel also provide on-site installation and training services to help customers make optimal use of product features and functions.

Our customers typically purchase a one-year maintenance contract which entitles them to an array of services provided by our technical support team. Maintenance services provided under the contract include online updates, software error correction releases, hardware repair and replacement, and, in the majority of cases, round-the-clock call center support. Free updates of our software are available to customers with a current maintenance contract. We also offer an online, automated, self-help customer support function called “Ask F5” that provides answers to many commonly asked questions, allowing customers to get information and solve problems quickly while significantly reducing the number of calls to our support desk. This enables us to provide comprehensive customer support while keeping our support-related expenses at a manageable, consistent level. We also offer an online service called iHealth, which allows customers to diagnose up-to-the-minute snapshots of their BIG-IP systems. Diagnoses include tailored feedback about configuration issues or code defects, a description of the issue, recommendations for resolution, and a link to further information in the AskF5™ Knowledge Base.

F5 offers training classes for customers on the configuration and use of products, including local and wide area network system administration and management. We have a complete certification program that qualifies our partners and customers for









having the appropriate skills to implement and use the functionality of our products. To provide our customers with onsite and remote help, we have a professional services team able to provide a full range of fee-based consulting services, including comprehensive network management, documentation and performance analysis, and capacity planning to assist in predicting future network requirements. During fiscal year 2014 we increased the relative size or our professional services team in response to increasing customer demand.

Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of our pre-configured hardware platforms to third party contract manufacturers for assembly according to our specifications.

Our purpose-built systems are manufactured by Flextronics International LTD. Subcontracting activity at Flextronics encompasses prototype builds, full production and direct fulfillment. Flextronics also performs the following activities on our behalf; material procurement, PCB assembly and test, final assembly, system test, quality control, direct shipment and warranty repairs. We provide a rolling forecast that allows our contract manufacturers to stock component parts and other materials, plan capacity and build finished goods inventory in anticipation of end user demand. Flextronics procures components in volumes consistent with our forecast, assembles the products and tests them according to our specifications. Products are then shipped to our distributors, value-added resellers, or end users. Generally, we do not own the components. Title to the products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and then to our customers upon shipment from a designated fulfillment location. If the components are unused or the products are not sold within specified periods of time, we may incur carrying charges or obsolete material charges for components that our contract manufacturers purchased to build products to meet our forecast or customer orders.

Hardware components for our products consist primarily of commodity parts and certain custom components designed and approved by our hardware engineering group. Most of our components are purchased from sources which we believe are readily available from other suppliers. However, some components used in the assembly of our products are purchased from a single or limited source.

Certain sub-assembly and testing processes of our products are performed at Flextronics' facility in Zhuhai, China. The majority of our sub-assemblies are shipped to Flextronics' Milpitas, California plant for configuration and final testing and eventual distribution to our end users. We also have capabilities to complete this process for some of our products in Flextronics' Zhuhai, China plant for distribution to APAC and Japan end users.

Competition

The expanding capabilities of our product offerings have enabled us to address a growing array of market opportunities, many of which are outside the bounds of the application delivery networking market as defined and measured by industry analysts such as Gartner Group, Dell’Oro and others. In addition to server load-balancing, traffic management and other functions normally associated with application delivery, our suite of integrated product modules has expanded our addressable market into security, WAN optimization, application acceleration, policy management, and Diameter signaling and routing, where we compete with a growing number of companies not included among traditional ADC vendors. The ability to create custom network services using iRules, iControl and iCall has also enabled us, our customers, and our partners to design solutions to problems for which there is no off-the-shelf solution. As a result, we believe the traditional definitions of our market do not encompass all of the features, functions and capabilities of our products or accurately represent the addressable market for those products.

Within the more narrowly defined traditional ADC market, several companies sell server load-balancing products. These include Brocade Communications Systems, Inc., Citrix Systems, Inc. and a number of smaller competitors: Radware Ltd, A10 Networks, Array Networks, Inc., Barracuda Networks, Inc., and Riverbed Technology.

In related ADC markets we compete with the following:

•Cisco, Juniper Networks and Checkpoint Systems in the network firewall market;

•Cisco, Imperva and Citrix in the web application firewall market;

•Cisco, Juniper and A10 in Carrier Grade NAT;

•Procera, Allot, Sandvine and other DPI vendors with our PEM offerings;

•Riverbed Technology and Silver Peak Systems in the WAN optimization and application acceleration market; and

•Oracle via the acquisition of Tekelec and Acme Packet in the Diameter signaling market.









•IBM in end-user protection against malware, phishing and other cyberthreats.

•Akamai Networks in cloud-based DDoS protection.

•Blue Coat Systems in protecting enterprises from inbound and outbound malware.

The principal competitive factors in the markets in which we compete include product features and performance, customer support, brand recognition, the scope of distribution and sales channels and pricing. Certain of our competitors have employed and may in the future adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share. However, because of the superior performance, broad functionality and unique capabilities of our products, which have resulted in high levels of customer satisfaction and growing brand awareness, we believe that we can and will compete effectively against such pricing policies.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We have obtained216patents in the United States,15foreign patents and have applications pending for various aspects of our technology. Our future success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies used in our principal products. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use trade secrets or other information that we regard as proprietary. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United States. Any issued patent may not preserve our proprietary position, and competitors or others may develop technologies similar to or superior to our technology. Our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.

In addition to our own proprietary software, we incorporate software licensed from several third-party sources into our products. These are generally term licenses which may renew annually and that generally provide for certain rights and licenses to support our customers post termination. While we may not be able to renew certain of these licenses in the future, we believe that alternative technologies for these licenses are available both domestically and internationally.



Employees

As ofSeptember 30, 2014, we had3,834full-time employees, including1,054in product development,1,448in sales and marketing,945in professional services and technical support and387in accounting and finance, administration and operations. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have experienced no work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.
