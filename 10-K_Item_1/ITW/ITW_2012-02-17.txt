80/20 Business Process

A key element of the Company’s business strategy is its continuous 80/20 business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions. The basic concept of this 80/20 business process is to
focus on what is most important (the 20% of the items which account for 80% of the value) and to spend less time and resources on the less important (the 80% of the items which account for 20% of the value). The Company’s operations use this
80/20 business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business, and as a result, reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important. The Company’s operations utilize the 80/20 process in various aspects of their
business. Common applications of the 80/20 business process include:



•Simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products, outsourcing products or, as a last
resort, eliminating low-value products.



•Segmenting the customer base by focusing on the 80/20 customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the 20/80 customers.



•Simplifying the supplier base by partnering with 80/20 suppliers and reducing the number of 20/80 suppliers.



•Designing business processes, systems and measurements around the 80/20 activities.

The result of the application of this 80/20 business process is that the Company has over time improved its long-term operating and financial
performance. These 80/20 efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins. Corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better
apply this 80/20 business process and improve their results.

Acquisitions and Divestitures

As part of the Company’s ongoing strategy, the Company acquires businesses with complementary products and services as well as larger acquisitions
that represent potential new platforms. Refer to the Acquisitions note in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for discussion of the Company’s acquired businesses.

The Company periodically reviews its operations for businesses which may no longer be aligned with its long-term objectives. Refer to the Discontinued Operations note in Item 8. Financial Statements

The information set forth below is applicable to all industry segments of the Company unless otherwise
noted:

Competition

With
operations in 58 countries, the Company offers a wide range of products in a myriad of markets, many of which are fragmented, and we encounter a variety of competitors that vary by product line, end market and geographic area. Our competitors
include many regional or specialized companies, as well as large U.S. and non-U.S. companies or divisions of large companies. Each of our segments generally has several main competitors and numerous smaller ones in most of their end markets and
geographic areas. In addition to numerous smaller regional competitors, the welding business in the Power Systems & Electronics segment competes globally with Lincoln Electric and the Decorative Surfaces segment competes globally with the
Formica Group.

In virtually all segments, we compete on the basis of product innovation, product quality, brand preference, service delivery
and price. Technical capability is also a competitive factor in most of our segments. We believe that for each of our segments, our primary competitive advantages derive from our decentralized operating structure, which creates a strong focus on end
markets and customers at the local level, enabling our businesses to respond rapidly to market dynamics. This structure enables our business units to drive operational excellence utilizing our 80/20 business process and leverages our product
innovation capabilities. We also believe that our global footprint is a competitive advantage in many of our markets, especially in our Transportation and Decorative Surfaces segments.

Raw Materials

The Company uses raw materials of various types, primarily steel, resins,
chemicals and paper, that are available from numerous commercial sources. The availability of materials and energy has not resulted in any significant business interruptions or other major problems, and no such problems are currently anticipated.

Research and Development

Developing new and improved products, broadening the application of established products, and continuing efforts to improve and develop new methods,
processes and equipment all contribute to the Company’s organic growth. Many new products are designed to reduce customers’ costs by eliminating steps in their manufacturing processes, reducing the number of parts in an assembly or by
improving the quality of customers’ assembled products. Typically, the development of such products is accomplished by working closely with customers on specific applications. Research and development expenses were $242,979,000 in 2011,
$213,339,000 in 2010 and $191,859,000 in 2009.

Intellectual Property

The Company owns approximately 3,800 unexpired U.S. patents and 8,500 foreign patents covering articles, methods and machines. In addition, the Company has approximately 1,700 applications for patents
pending in the United States Patent Office and 5,000 pending in foreign patent offices, but there is no assurance that any of these patents will be issued. The Company maintains an active patent department for the administration of patents and
processing of patent applications.

The Company believes that many of its patents are valuable and important; however, the expiration of any
one of the Company’s patents would not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations or financial position. The Company also credits its leadership in the markets it serves to engineering capability; manufacturing
techniques; skills and efficiency; marketing and sales promotion; and service and delivery of quality products to its customers.

In addition
to patents, many of the Company’s products and services are sold under various owned or licensed trademarks, which are important to the Company in the aggregate. Some of the Company’s more significant trademarks include ITW, which is also
used in conjunction with many of its businesses; Deltar and Shakeproof in the Transportation segment; Signode in the Industrial Packaging segment; Miller in the Power Systems & Electronics segment; Hobart in the Food Equipment segment;
Paslode in the Construction Products segment; and Wilsonart in the Decorative Surfaces segment.

Environmental

The Company believes that its manufacturing plants and equipment are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental regulations. Additional
measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company’s capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.

Various legislative and administrative regulations concerning environmental issues have become effective or are under consideration in many parts of the world relating to manufacturing processes and the
sale or use of certain products. To date, such developments have not had a substantial adverse impact on the Company’s revenues or earnings. The Company has made considerable efforts to develop and sell environmentally compatible products.






Employees

The Company employed approximately 65,000 persons as of December 31, 2011 and considers its employee relations to be excellent.

International

The Company’s international operations include subsidiaries and joint
ventures in 57 foreign countries on six continents. These operations serve such end markets as construction, general industrial, automotive, food institutional/restaurant and service, food and beverage, electronics, consumer durables, primary
metals, and others on a worldwide basis. The Company’s revenues from sales to customers outside the United States were approximately 59% of revenues in 2011, 58% of revenues in 2010 and 58% of revenues in 2009.

Refer to Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Segment Information note in
Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for additional information on international activities. International operations are subject to certain risks inherent in conducting business in foreign countries, including price controls,
exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, nationalization, expropriation and other governmental action, and changes in currency exchange rates. Additional risks of our international operations are described under
“Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
