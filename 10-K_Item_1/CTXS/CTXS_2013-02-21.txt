Citrix is a Delaware corporation founded on April 17, 1989.

Business Overview

For over two decades, we have pursued our long-term vision: a world where people can experience work and life in harmony. We've led several waves of innovation to help our customers realize that vision. Today, mobility and cloud services offer us the greatest opportunities to continue to advance that vision.

We see very clearly two forces impacting our customers' IT organizations - consumerization and industrialization of IT.  These forces are creating two rapidly growing gaps, between the consumer computing experience and the enterprise experience, and between the speed and flexibility of the cloud versus that of traditional enterprise IT.

These forces are accelerating the disruption of our accustomed ways of computing; but they are also enabling the reinvention of work, of computing and of business - in a concept called mobile workstyles, enabled by cloud services.

We are combining our products and technologies in the areas of mobility, desktop virtualization, cloud networking, cloud platforms, collaboration, and data sharing into a compelling set of solutions that power mobile workstyles and cloud services. An overview of our current products and solutions follows.



Products and Services

Our products and services target customers of all sizes, from individuals and professional consumers, to large global enterprises. Two divisions, the Enterprise division, comprised of Mobile and Desktop and Networking and Cloud and the Online Services division, comprised of Collaboration and Data, administer the research and development, product marketing, and product management for our offerings. Broadly, as an organizing principle, we group our offerings in the following main categories within our two divisions:



Mobile and Desktop

Desktop Virtualization

Our Desktop Virtualization products are built to transform and reduce the cost of traditional desktop management by virtualizing the desktop and applications in the datacenter.

•Citrix®XenDesktop®is a fully integrated desktop virtualization system that gives customers the flexibility to deliver desktops and apps as cloud services - enabling mobile workstyles and simplifying desktop management. XenDesktop breaks down traditional cost barriers by reducing server and storage costs through the use of pooled desktops that can be personalized on-demand. XenDesktop is available in multiple editions designed for different requirements, from simple VDI-only deployments to sophisticated, enterprise-class desktop and application delivery services that can meet the needs of everything from basic call center environments to high-powered graphics workstations. In XenDesktop Enterprise and Platinum editions, customers also receive the industry-leading Citrix XenApp to manage and mobilize Windows applications. FlexCast delivery technology powers all these options for delivering desktops and apps, for different types of users and use cases, while optimizing solution

The expanded partnership will include investments in people and resources to drive market-leading technology innovation, solution integration and validation, customer support, and joint go-to-market investment on a global basis.










Additional Relationships

Over the past year, our partners have expanded their focus on the broad range of Citrix products. Some examples include Alcatel-Lucent, who OEMs Citrix CloudPlatform as a part of their CloudBand solution, and Dell who OEMs VDI-in-a-box as an appliance, called DVS-Simplified, and XenDesktop, called DVS-Enterprise. HP, IBM and Fujitsu also have multiple offerings in the market with XenDesktop. Announced in 2012, Amazon now re-sells Citrix NetScaler and Citrix CloudBridge in its Advanced Web Services, or AWS, Marketplace.

Through our Citrix Ready program, more than 21,000 products have been verified to work with Citrix technologies. In addition, numerous partners proactively incorporate Citrix products and technologies such as Receiver, XenServer, XenDesktop, XenClient, XenApp, NetScaler, CloudGateway, VDI-in-a-Box and HDX (ICA) technology into their customer offerings. Our HDX and Receiver technologies are often included with or offered for thin clients, industry-standard servers and mobile devices, such as Apple's iPhone and iPad, Windows Mobile, Blackberry and Google Android devices. Licensees include Dell, Fujitsu and Hewlett Packard, among others. Our XenClient technology was developed in cooperation with Intel and is licensed for shipment by desktop computer manufacturers, including Dell and Hewlett Packard.



Research and Development

We focus our research and development efforts on developing new products and core technologies in our core markets and to further enhancing the functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing products. We solicit extensive feedback concerning product development from customers, both directly from and indirectly through our channel distributors.

We believe that our software development teams and core technologies represent a significant competitive advantage for us. Included in the software development teams is a group focused on research activities that include prototyping ways to integrate emerging technologies and standards into our product offerings, such as emerging Web services technologies, management standards and Microsoft's newest technologies. Many groups within the software development teams have expertise in Extensible Markup Language, or XML, based software development, integration of acquired technology, multi-tier Web-based application development and deployment, SSL secure access, hypervisor technologies, cloud technologies, networking technologies, VoIP-based audio technology, Web-based video technology and building SaaS. We incurred research and development expenses of approximately$450.6 millionin2012,$380.7 millionin2011and$361.4 millionin2010.In addition to internal research and development, Citrix also supports an eco-system of early stage companies via our Startup Accelerator program which provides seed capital for new technologies.



Sales, Marketing and Services

We market and license our products and services through multiple channels worldwide, including Value-Added Resellers known as Citrix Solution Advisors™, VADs, Service Providers, SIs, Independent Software Vendors (ISVs), direct over-the-Web and OEMs. These distribution channels are managed by our worldwide sales and services organization. We provide training and certification to Solution Advisors, integrators, and consultants for the full-range of Citrix products, solutions and services through our Citrix Partner Network. In addition, our Online Services division provides Enterprise SaaS offerings through direct corporate sales, Solution Advisors, and direct over-the-Web through our websites.

In 2012, we continued to focus on increasing the productivity of our existing partners and building capacity through recruitment of new partners to sell and implement our expanding product portfolio. Our channel incentive program, Citrix Advisor Rewards™, is an innovative influencer program that rewards our partners for registering projects and providing value-added selling even if they do not fulfill the product. In 2012, we offered additional Advisor Rewards incentives to increase partner mindshare, limit channel conflict and increase partner loyalty to us.

As Citrix continues to evolve as a cloud computing company enabling mobile workstyles, we have also been cultivating a base of over 2,000 partners for XenDesktop and XenApp known as the Citrix Service Provider program. These partners consume technology on a subscription basis in order to deliver IT Services to multiple corporate entities. Our Citrix Service Provider channel is one of the fastest growing channels at Citrix today, and we see the demand increasing for these cloud-based services as small and mid-sized businesses require an outsourced model for their IT.

For all of our channels, we regularly take actions to improve the effectiveness of our partner programs and strengthen our channel relationships, including managing non-performing partners, adding new partners with expertise in selling into new markets and forming additional strategic global and national partnerships. SI and ISV engagement continues to be a substantial part of our strategy in the large enterprise and government markets. The SI program includes organizations such as Accenture, Atos Origin, Computer Sciences Corporation, Dimension Data, Hewlett Packard, Fujitsu, IBM Global Services, Wipro and TATA Consultancy Services Limited, among others. The ISV program has a strong representation from targeted industry verticals such as healthcare, financial services and telecommunications. Members in the ISV program include Cerner










Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, McKesson Corporation, Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, SAP AG and Siemens Medical Health Solutions, among many others.

Our corporate marketing organization provides sales event support, sales collateral, advertising, direct mail, industry analyst relations and public relations coverage to our indirect channels to aid in market development and in attracting new customers. Our partner development organization actively supports our partners to improve their commitment and capabilities with Citrix solutions. Our customer sales organization consists of field-based systems sales engineers and corporate sales professionals who work directly with our largest customers, and coordinate integration services provided by our partners. Additional sales personnel, working in central locations and in the field, provide additional support including recruitment of prospective partners and technical training with respect to our products.

Although we have thousands of partnerships, one distributor, Ingram Micro, accounted for16%of our net revenues in2012,17%of our total net revenues in2011and17%of our total net revenues in2010. Our distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries, each of which covers different countries or regions. Each of these agreements is separately negotiated and is independent of any other contract (such as a master distribution agreement), one of which was individually responsible for over 10% of our total net revenues in each of the last three fiscal years. In addition, there was no individual VAR that accounted for over 10% of our total net revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010.

We are not obligated to accept product returns from our channel distributors under any conditions, unless the product item is defective in manufacture. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 for information regarding our revenue recognition policy.

International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for approximately45.3%of our net revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2012,43.2%of our net revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2011and42.7%of our net revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2010. For detailed information on our international revenues, please refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2012.

Segment Revenue

Our revenues are derived from our Enterprise division products, which primarily include Mobile and Desktop products, Networking and Cloud products and related license updates and maintenance, support and professional services and from our Online Services division's Collaboration and Data products. The Enterprise division and the Online Services division constitute our two reportable segments. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2012.



Operations

We control all purchasing, inventory, scheduling, order processing and accounting functions related to our operations. For our software products, production, warehousing and shipping are performed by our independent contractor HP, Ireland. Master software CD-ROMs, development of user manuals, packaging designs, initial product quality control and testing are primarily performed at our facilities. In some cases, independent contractors also duplicate CD-ROMs, print documentation and package and assemble products to our specifications.










While it is generally our practice to promptly ship product upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders, we sometimes have orders that have not shipped upon receipt of a purchase order. Although the amount of such product license orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such orders at the end of a fiscal year is not material to our business. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance.

We believe that our fourth quarter revenues and expenses are affected by a number of seasonal factors, including the lapse of many corporations' fiscal year budgets and an increase in amounts paid pursuant to our sales compensation plans due to compensation plan accelerators that are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these seasonal factors are common within our industry. Such factors historically have resulted in first quarter revenues in any year being lower than the immediately preceding fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue through the first quarter of 2013. In addition, our European operations generally generate lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. This seasonal factor also typically results in higher fourth quarter revenues.



Competition

We sell our products in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. As the markets for our products and services continue to develop, additional companies, including those with significant market presence in the computer appliances, software and networking industries, could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “-Technology Relationships” and Part I-Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Mobile and Desktop

Our Desktop Virtualization products are based on an alternative technology platform the success of which will depend on organizations and customers perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with adopting desktop virtualization solutions. Our primary competition in this market is the existing IT desktop management practice of manually configuring physical desktops, which is time-consuming, expensive and inconsistent. We also face numerous competitors that provide automation of these processes and alternative approaches, including VMWare's View product and Oracle Corporation, or Oracle's, broad virtualization stack which is a feature of its operating system and management software. We believe XenDesktop gives Citrix a competitive advantage by providing customers multiple ways to manage desktops within one, integrated desktop virtualization system.

Cloud Gateway also faces competition from VMware and a host of other, smaller solution providers. We believe Citrix offers the only integrated solution that aggregates, controls and delivers Windows, Web, SaaS and mobile applications to virtually any device, bringing all of the various components together. Further, we believe that our end-user experience has a competitive edge when compared to the alternative solutions due to the intuitiveness and self-service features of our offering.

XenMobile and Mobile Solutions Bundle compete with AirWatch, MobileIron and Good Technology. We believe we differentiate ourselves from these competitors by providing the most complete solution on the market, providing mobile device management (MDM), mobile application management (MAM) and core wireless applications, including secure wireless email, calendar and browser.

Networking and Cloud

Our NetScaler products compete against other established competitors, including, F5 Networks, Inc., or F5 and to a lesser extent, A10 Networks. Both compete with us for traditional enterprise sales opportunities, while F5 is our principal competitor in the Internet-centric market segment. We continue to enhance NetScaler's feature capability and aggressively market NetScaler to our existing customer base.

Our Bytemobile Smart Capacity product's primary competition is a network engineering organization that elects not to employ the type of optimization solution we offer. In addition, Bytemobile Smart Capacity competes with single-purpose or limited-purpose vendors that address a portion of what our product offers and may or may not partner with other vendors to complete their offerings. Our Bytemobile Smart Capacity product is the market share leader in the video and web optimization market, with a large installed base of tier-one mobile network operator customers. We believe that Bytemobile Smart Capacity has competitive advantages both in core optimization technology and in its ability to consolidate disparate hardware and software functionality into a single managed network element.

Competition for CloudBridge, which includes the product formerly known as Branch Repeater, comes in the form of alternative approaches to making the cloud a secure extension of a company's on-premise enterprise network, such as WAN optimization, Internet protocol security, or IPSec, or multi-protocol label switching, or MPLS, network solutions, among










others. F5 is a key competitor in this space. With regards to WAN optimization, CloudBridge also competes with Cisco and Riverbed Technology, Inc., or Riverbed. Cisco has the largest market share, benefiting from its leadership in the networking market. Riverbed is a less established company than Citrix, but has the advantage of being focused solely on WAN optimization. We believe CloudBridge is a more feature-rich solution than the other alternatives and provides superior flexibility as part of NetScaler.

VMware is also the main competitor for our CloudPlatform product (formerly CloudStack), which is an advanced platform for building highly scalable and reliable cloud computing environments, and our CloudPortal product, which is a comprehensive portal for provisioning hosted applications, desktops, services and IaaS. Unlike VMware's products, our CloudPlatform and CloudPortal products draw on the successful models and experience of large, public cloud implementations and apply them to enterprise, private clouds. The differentiation and experience of our products is expanded when coupled with our NetScaler and XenServer products, both of which are used in large, public cloud implementations. Additionally, OpenStack, an open source project, provides an alternative solution to our CloudPlatform product. We believe CloudPlatform has a competitive advantage as it is production ready for cloud deployment.

In the server virtualization market, we compete directly with VMware, which was first to market with this technology and is widely regarded as the market leader. In addition, we also compete with Microsoft's Windows Server 2012 with Hyper-V. Microsoft first entered this market in 2008 and has since established its position as a leader in this space. To a lesser extent, and mostly only in the niche technology areas of test and development, we compete with RedHat, who recently expanded into this market. We believe XenServer, our server virtualization product, has features that are competitive with VMware's ESX Server in terms of performance, scalability and other enterprise-class capabilities. XenServer is offered as a free download, which significantly increases the reach of server virtualization to customers of all sizes and geographies. We monetize the XenServer product with premium editions that extend the platform to enable organizations of any size to integrate and automate management processes, delivering a virtual datacenter solution.

Collaboration and Data

Our products for collaboration continue to maintain solid leadership positions in extremely competitive markets, particularly among, Small to Medium-sized Businesses, or SMBs. We differentiate our SaaS offerings by designing simple, secure, reliable and cost-efficient products that deliver a superior customer experience. Our competitors range from large, established technology firms to small, Internet-based startups.

In Collaboration, we compete primarily with Cisco's WebEx, Microsoft Lync and Skype, as well as collaboration solutions from Adobe Systems, Inc., or Adobe. Additionally we compete with freemium products such as Logmein's Join.me and Google's Google + Hangouts. Our GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar and GoToTraining products have proven to be competitive based on ease-of-use and the All You Can Meet® pricing model. In addition, we offer advanced VoIP-based audio technology, which allows us to market audio conference calling services directly to SMBs and enterprises. We further differentiate our collaboration products by integrating PSTN, VoIP and toll-free audio services. We believe these features give us competitive advantage among individual, prosumer and SMB customers. We further expanded our collaboration offerings with GoToTraining®, an online training product purpose-built for the corporate training market.

We have been a market leader with our GoToMyPC product for many years. Our direct competition includes LogMeIn, Inc., or LogMeIn, free solutions such as Microsoft's Live Mesh and those from many Internet startups. In addition, new remote access features in desktop operating systems like Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OSX provide alternatives to our solution. We endeavor to differentiate our products by continuing our focus on security, ease-of-use and support for multiple desktop operating systems.

Our GoToAssist product has achieved the largest market share for Web-based clientless remote support. This product includes a version purpose-built for individual users, consultants and small businesses, positioning Citrix as the only provider of remote support solutions for all segments of the market. In remote support, we compete with Cisco's WebEx and LogMeIn.

In the data sharing market, ShareFile's direct competition includes Dropbox, Inc., Box, Inc. and YouSendIt, Inc., as well as legacy solutions like traditional file transfer protocol, or FTP, in the SMB market. Many of these competitors have strong brand recognition through their consumer and free versions of their products. However, we believe ShareFile offers a superior solution as it is built specifically for the needs of businesses. In the Enterprise segment, there are fewer direct competitors to the ShareFile product. Increased competition is anticipated as large enterprises need to deploy secure data syncing and sharing solutions for a growing mobile workforce. We believe that Citrix's strong reputation in the Enterprise market, along with ShareFile's integration into Citrix products such as Receiver, and our unique ability to store data on-premise or in the Cloud, will be a key differentiator.

Our success is dependent upon certain proprietary technologies and core intellectual property. We have been awarded numerous domestic and foreign patents and have numerous pending patent applications in the United States and foreign countries.
