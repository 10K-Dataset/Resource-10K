ITEM 1.BUSINESS

General

Citrix is leading the transition to software-defining the workplace, uniting virtualization, mobility management, networking and SaaS solutions to enable new ways for businesses and people to work better. Citrix solutions power business mobility through secure, mobile workspaces that provide people with instant access to apps, desktops, data and communications on any device, over any network or cloud.

We market and license our products directly to customers, over the Web, and through systems integrators, or SIs, in addition to indirectly through value-added resellers, or VARs, value-added distributors, or VADs, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs and service providers.

Citrix is a Delaware corporation founded on April 17, 1989.

Business Overview

For the past twenty-six years, we have been a visionary in software-defining the workplace guided by our core belief that “work is not a place". A software-defined workplace is one where people can securely and effortlessly collaborate across the boundaries of time, place and device. In a software-defined workplace, people create better business outcomes, they are more productive and engaged and their businesses are more agile and responsive to change.

We have positioned, scaled and transformed Citrix through significant growth phases from remote access, to web app delivery, to virtualization, to mobile workspaces and now we are doing it again.

Our customers are faced with the pressures to deliver business results while creating an engaging work-life experience for their employees. Our focus on enabling a software-defined workplace is putting Citrix in front of this strategic challenge through the unique integration of our workspace services, delivery networking and mobility apps.



Products and Services

Our products and services target customers of all sizes, from individuals and professional consumers, to large global enterprises. Two divisions, the Enterprise and Service Provider division and the Mobility Apps (formerly Software as a Service, or SaaS) division, administer the research and development, product marketing, and product management for our offerings. Our Enterprise and Service Provider division is comprised of Workspace Services (formerly Mobile and Desktop) and Delivery Networking (formerly Networking and Cloud) products. Our Mobility Apps (formerly SaaS) division is comprised of Communications Cloud, Documents Cloud and Workflow Cloud products. Broadly, as an organizing principle, we group our offerings in the following main categories within our two divisions:

Sales, Marketing and Services

We market and license our products and services through multiple channels worldwide, including selling through resellers and direct over the Web. Our partner community comprises thousands of value-added resellers known as Citrix Solution Advisors™, VADs, cloud service providers, SIs, Independent Software Vendors, or ISVs and OEMs. Distribution channels are managed by our worldwide sales and services organization. Partners receive training and certification opportunities to support our expanding portfolio of products, solutions and services. In addition, our Mobility Apps division provides our collaboration and data sharing offerings through direct corporate sales, our partner community, and direct through our web sites.

In 2014, we worked closely with partners to benefit from changes to our global partner program made in 2013. The changes included: differentiated Citrix Advisor Rewards by partner level; Citrix Opportunity Registration discounts for cloud networking; clear, published criteria for achieving Gold and Platinum status; and refreshed certification requirements to expedite acquisition of the latest knowledge and skills. Citrix Advisor Rewards™, is an innovative influencer program that rewards our partners for registering projects and demonstrating value-added selling even if the sale is fulfilled by another partner. In 2014 we offered full year promotions with additional rewards for selling to new customers as well as lowered the deal qualifications to include partner sales to Small and Medium businesses. We introduced new certifications and a sales enablement platform to provide partners with the breadth of skills required to plan, design, deliver and support our solutions. We continued to focus on increasing the productivity of our existing partners, and building capacity through targeted recruitment, introducing programs to increase partner mindshare, limit channel conflict and increase partner loyalty to us.

As Citrix continues to lead with cloud services, we have been cultivating a global base of over 2,600 partners within the Citrix Service Provider program. These partners, consisting of managed service providers, IT hosting companies and Telcos, license Citrix desktop, application, networking and MDM products on a monthly subscription basis. With these technologies partners then create various vertically differentiated offers of their own, consisting of cloud-hosted applications and cloud-hosted desktops, which they then resell both to SMBs and to enterprise IT. Besides supplying technology, Citrix is actively engaged in assisting these partners develop their hosted businesses by supplying business and marketing assistance.

For all of our channels, we regularly take actions to improve the effectiveness of our partner programs and further strengthen our channel relationships through management of non-performing partners, recruitment of partners with expertise in selling into new markets and forming additional strategic global and national partnerships. Engagement with SIs and ISVs continues to be a substantial part of our strategic roadmap within large enterprise and government markets. Our integrator partnerships include organizations such as Accenture, Capgemini, Computer Sciences Corporation, Dimension Data, Hewlett Packard, Fujitsu, IBM Global Services, and Wipro, among others. Computer Sciences Corporation, Fujitsu, Hewlett Packard, IBM and Wipro all deliver offerings powered by the Citrix Workspace Suite. The ISV program maintains a strong representation across targeted industry verticals including healthcare, financial services and telecommunications. Members in the ISV program include Allscripts, Cerner Corporation, Epic Systems Corporation, McKesson Corporation, and Siemens Medical Health Solutions, among several others.

Our corporate marketing organization provides sales and industry event support, demand generation, web and social marketing, sales tools and collateral, advertising, direct mail, industry analyst relations and public relations coverage to our indirect channels to aid in market development and in attracting new customers. Our partner development organization actively










supports our partners to improve their commitment and capabilities with Citrix solutions. Our customer sales organization consists of field-based sales engineers and corporate sales professionals who work directly with our largest customers, and coordinate integration services provided by our partners. Additional sales personnel, working in central locations and in the field, provide support including recruitment of prospective partners and technical training with respect to our products.

Although we have thousands of partnerships, one distributor, Ingram Micro, accounted for13%of our net revenues in2014,14%of our total net revenues in2013and16%of our total net revenues in2012. Our distributor arrangements with Ingram Micro consist of several non-exclusive, independently negotiated agreements with its subsidiaries, each of which covers different countries or regions. Each agreement is negotiated separately and is independent of any other contract (such as a master distribution agreement), one of which was individually responsible for over 10% of our total net revenues in each of the last three fiscal years. In addition, there was no individual VAR that accounted for over 10% of our total net revenues in2014,2013and2012.

We are not obligated to accept product returns from our distributors under any conditions, unless the product item is defective in manufacture. See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” and Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2014for information regarding our revenue recognition policy.

International revenues (sales outside the United States) accounted for approximately45.2%of our net revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2014,45.4%of our net revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2013and45.3%of our net revenues for the year endedDecember 31, 2012. For detailed information on our international revenues, please refer to Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2014.

Segment Revenue

Our revenues are derived from our Enterprise and Service Provider division products, which primarily include Workspace Services solutions, Delivery Networking products and related license updates and maintenance, support and professional services and from our Mobility Apps division's Communications Cloud, Documents Cloud and Workflow Cloud products. The Enterprise and Service Provider division and the Mobility Apps division constitute our two reportable segments. See Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year endedDecember 31, 2014.



Operations

We control all purchasing, inventory, scheduling, order processing and accounting functions related to our operations. For our software products, production, warehousing and shipping are performed by our independent contractors HP, Ireland and Digital River. Master software CD-ROMs, development of user manuals, packaging designs, initial product quality control and testing are primarily performed at our facilities. In some cases, independent contractors also duplicate CD-ROMs, print documentation and package and assemble products to our specifications.

While it is generally our practice to promptly ship product upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders, we sometimes have orders that have not shipped upon receipt of a purchase order. Although the amount of such product license orders may vary, the amount, if any, of such orders at the end of a fiscal year is not material to our business. We do not believe that backlog, as of any particular date, is a reliable indicator of future performance.










We believe that our fourth quarter revenues and expenses are affected by a number of seasonal factors, including the lapse of many corporations' fiscal year budgets and an increase in amounts paid pursuant to our sales compensation plans due to compensation plan accelerators that are often triggered in the fourth quarter. We believe that these seasonal factors are common within our industry. Such factors historically have resulted in first quarter revenues in any year being lower than the immediately preceding fourth quarter. We expect this trend to continue through the first quarter of 2015. In addition, our European operations generally generate lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced economic activity in Europe during the summer. This seasonal factor also typically results in higher fourth quarter revenues.



Competition

We sell our products in intensely competitive markets. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing and other resources than we do. As the markets for our products and services continue to develop, additional companies, including those with significant market presence in the computer appliances, software and networking industries, could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition. In addition, we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future. As a result, we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. See “-Technology Relationships” and Part I-Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.

Workspace Services

Our Desktop and Application Virtualization products are based on an alternative technology platform the success of which will depend on organizations and customers perceiving technological and operational benefits and cost savings associated with adopting desktop and application virtualization solutions. We differentiate from basic virtualization solutions with robust security and flexibility to enable IT to deliver Windows apps and desktops for better business outcomes. Our primary competition in this market is the existing IT desktop management practice of manually configuring physical desktops, which is time-consuming, expensive and subject to inconsistency. We also face numerous competitors that provide automation of these processes and alternative approaches, including VMware's Horizon product and Oracle Corporation, or Oracle's, broad virtualization stack which is a feature of its operating system and management software. We believe XenDesktop and XenApp give Citrix a competitive advantage by providing customers multiple ways to virtualize and deliver desktops and or apps with one, integrated virtualization system and delivering a higher performance user experience, more robust security and the flexibility for people to use any device and IT to use any cloud infrastructure - public or private.

Our Enterprise Mobility Management product line, XenMobile, competes with AirWatch by VMware, MobileIron, Good Technology and other smaller competitors. We believe we differentiate ourselves from these competitors by providing the most complete solution on the market, with MDM, MAM and core mobile productivity applications, including secure mobile email, calendar, browser, notes and more. Our apps feature unique workflow integrations designed to make people work better, a significant advantage over competitors that rely on third parties for their mobile apps and can drive similar integrations.

We also see competition from competitors that are combining mobile and desktop technologies. We believe the Citrix solution, Citrix Workspace Suite, is the best solution available today that can securely deliver a mobile workspace - all Windows, Web, SaaS and native mobile applications, data and virtual desktops - to any device, anywhere. VMware responded to our introduction of the Citrix Workspace Suite with the introduction of the VMware Workspace Suite. We expect other vendors to follow suit. We offer market-leading technologies for every component of the Citrix Workspace Suite. Further, we believe that our end-user experience is a competitive edge when compared to the alternative solutions due to the intuitiveness and self-service features of our offering.

Delivery Networking

Our NetScaler products compete against other established competitors, including, F5 Networks, Inc., or F5, and to a lesser extent, A10 Networks. Both compete with us for traditional enterprise sales opportunities, while F5 is our principal competitor in the Internet-centric market segment. We continue to enhance NetScaler's feature capability and aggressively market NetScaler to our existing customer base as well as expanding into telco and cloud provider markets.

Our ByteMobile Smart Capacity product's primary competition is a network engineering organization that elects not to employ the type of optimization solution we offer. In addition, ByteMobile Smart Capacity competes with single-purpose or limited-purpose vendors that address a portion of what our product offers and may or may not partner with other vendors to complete their offerings. Our ByteMobile Smart Capacity product is a market share leader in the video and web optimization market, with a large installed base of tier-one mobile network operator customers. We believe that ByteMobile Smart Capacity has competitive advantages both in core optimization technology and in its ability to consolidate disparate hardware and software functionality into a single managed network element.










Competition for CloudBridge comes in the form of alternative approaches to making the cloud a secure extension of a company’s on-premise enterprise network, Internet protocol security, or IPSec, or multi-protocol label switching, or MPLS, network solutions, among others. With regards to WAN optimization, CloudBridge also competes with Riverbed Technology, Inc., or Riverbed and Cisco. Riverbed has the largest market share. While being a less established company than Citrix, Riverbed has the advantage of being focused solely on WAN optimization. Cisco with the second largest share, benefits from its leadership in the networking market. We believe CloudBridge is a more feature-rich solution than the other alternatives and provides superior flexibility through shared technology with NetScaler.

VMware is also the main competitor of our CloudPlatform product, which is an advanced platform for building highly scalable and reliable cloud computing environments, and our CloudPortal product, which is a comprehensive portal for provisioning hosted applications, desktops, services and IaaS. Unlike VMware's products, our CloudPlatform and CloudPortal products draw on the successful models and experience of large, public cloud implementations and apply them to enterprise, private clouds. The differentiation and experience of our products is expanded when coupled with our NetScaler and XenServer products, both of which are used in large, public cloud implementations. Additionally, OpenStack, an open source project, provides an alternative solution to our CloudPlatform product. We believe CloudPlatform has a competitive advantage, as it is production ready for cloud deployment.

In the server virtualization market, we compete directly with VMware, which was first to market with this technology and is widely regarded as the market leader. In addition, we also compete with Microsoft's Windows Server 2012 with Hyper-V. Microsoft first entered this market in 2008 and has since established its position as a leader in this space. To a lesser extent, and mostly only in the niche technology areas of test and development, we compete with RedHat, who recently expanded into this market. We believe XenServer, our server virtualization product, has features that are competitive with VMware's ESX Server in terms of performance, scalability and other enterprise-class capabilities. XenServer is offered as a free download, which significantly increases the reach of server virtualization to customers of all sizes and geographies. We monetize XenServer by selling maintenance and updates, which aligns with our CloudPlatform go-to-market strategy.

Mobility Apps

Our products for collaboration continue to maintain solid leadership positions in extremely competitive markets, particularly among, SMBs. We differentiate our SaaS offerings by designing simple, secure, reliable and cost-efficient products that deliver a superior customer experience. Our competitors range from large, established technology firms to small, Internet-based startups.

In Communications Cloud, we compete primarily with Cisco WebEx, Microsoft Lync and Skype, and conferencing call solutions from Intercall, PGi, AT&T and Verizon. Additionally we compete with freemium products such as Logmein's Join.me and Google's Google + Hangouts. Our GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar and GoToTraining products have proven to be competitive based on ease-of-use and the All You Can Meet® pricing model, combined with built-in VoIP and toll-based PSTN audio services. We further differentiate our collaboration products by integrating OpenVoice toll-free seamlessly with the built-in VoIP and toll audio services and having purpose-built solutions for marketing and training use cases. We believe these features give us competitive advantage among individual, prosumer and SMB customers.

In the data sharing market, our Documents Cloud direct competition includes Dropbox, Inc., Box, Inc. and HighTail, Inc. (formerly YouSendIt), as well as legacy solutions like traditional file transfer protocol, or FTP, in the SMB market. Many of these competitors have strong brand recognition through their consumer and free versions of their products. However, we believe our ShareFile product offers a superior solution as it is built specifically for the needs of businesses. In the Enterprise segment, there are fewer direct competitors to the ShareFile product. Increased competition is anticipated as large enterprises need to deploy secure data syncing and sharing solutions for a growing mobile workforce. We believe that Citrix's strong reputation in the Enterprise market, along with ShareFile's integration into Citrix products such as Receiver and XenMobile, and our unique ability to store data on-premise or in the Cloud, will be a key differentiator.

We have been a market leader with our GoToMyPC product for many years. Our direct competition includes LogMeIn, Inc., or LogMeIn, free solutions such as Microsoft's Live Mesh and those from many Internet startups. In addition, new remote access features in desktop operating systems like Microsoft Windows and Macintosh OSX provide alternatives to our solution. We endeavor to differentiate our products by continuing our focus on security, ease-of-use and support for multiple desktop operating systems.

Our Workflow Cloud product, GoToAssist, has achieved a large market share for Web-based clientless remote support. This product includes a version purpose-built for individual users, consultants and small businesses, positioning Citrix as the only provider of remote support solutions for all segments of the market. In remote support, we compete with Cisco's WebEx and LogMeIn.
