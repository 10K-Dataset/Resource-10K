Item 1.Business

The Company

SAIC is a holding company. Its
principal operating company, Science Applications, was formed in 1969. In October 2006, in connection with SAIC becoming a publicly-traded company, Science Applications completed a merger (reorganization merger) in which it became a 100%-owned
subsidiary of SAIC, after which SAIC completed an initial public offering of its common stock.

We use the terms “Company,” “we,”
“us,” and “our” to refer to SAIC, Science Applications and its consolidated subsidiaries. Unless otherwise noted, references to years are for fiscal years ended January 31. For example, we refer to the fiscal year ended
January 31, 2012 as “fiscal 2012”.

We are a provider of scientific, engineering, systems integration and technical services and
solutions in the areas of defense, health, energy, infrastructure, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance and cybersecurity to agencies of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), the intelligence community, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security
(DHS), and other U.S. Government civil agencies, state and local government agencies, foreign governments and customers in select commercial markets. Our business is focused on using deep domain knowledge to solve issues of vital importance to the
nation and the world in the areas of national security, energy and the environment, health and cybersecurity. We are focusing our investments in our strategic growth areas including: intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; cybersecurity;
logistics, readiness and sustainment; energy and environment; and health information technology. In each of the last three fiscal years, we generated over 90% of our total revenues from contracts with the U.S. Government, either as a prime
contractor or as a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. Government. For additional discussion and analysis related to recent business developments, see “Business Environment and Trends” in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Contract Procurement

Our business is heavily regulated and we must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other contracts. The U.S.
Government procurement environment has evolved due to statutory and regulatory procurement reform initiatives. Today, U.S. Government customers employ several procurement contracting methods to purchase services and solutions. Budgetary pressures
and reforms in the procurement process have caused many U.S. Government customers to increasingly purchase services and products using contracting processes that give them the ability to select multiple winners or pre-qualify certain contractors to
provide various services or products on established general terms and conditions rather than through single award contracts. The predominant contracting methods through which U.S. Government agencies procure services and products include the
following:



•Single Award Contracts.U.S. Government
agencies may procure services and products through single award contracts which specify the scope of services and products that will be delivered and identify the contractor that will provide the specified services. When an agency has a requirement,
interested contractors are solicited, qualified and then provided with a request for a proposal. The process of qualification, request for proposals and evaluation of contractor bids requires the agency to maintain a large, professional procurement
staff and the bidding and selection process can take a year or more to complete. For the contractor, this method of contracting may provide greater certainty of the timing and amounts to be received at the time of contract award because it generally
results in the customer contracting for a specific scope of services or products from the single successful awardee.



•Indefinite Delivery/Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) Contracts.The U.S. Government uses IDIQ contracts to obtain commitments from contractors to provide certain services or products on pre-established terms and conditions. The U.S. Government then issues task orders under the
IDIQ contracts to purchase the specific services or products it needs. IDIQ contracts are awarded to one or more contractors following a competitive procurement process. Under a single-award IDIQ contract, all task orders under that contract are
awarded to one pre-selected contractor. Under a multi-award IDIQ contract, task orders can be awarded to any of the pre-selected contractors, which can result in further limited competition for the award of task orders. Multi-award IDIQ contracts
that are open for any government agency to use for the procurement of services are commonly referred to as “government-wide acquisition contracts”. IDIQ contracts often have multi-year terms and unfunded ceiling amounts, therefore
enabling, but not committing, the U.S. Government to purchase substantial amounts of services or products from one or more contractors. At the time an IDIQ contract is awarded (prior to the award of any task orders), a contractor may have limited or
no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. Government will purchase under the contract, and in the case of a multi-award IDIQ, the contractor from which such purchases may be made.



•U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) Schedule Contracts.The GSA maintains listings of approved suppliers of services and products with agreed-upon prices for use throughout the U.S. Government. In order for a company to provide services under a GSA Schedule contract, a
company must be pre-qualified and awarded a contract by the GSA. When an agency uses a GSA Schedule contract to meet its requirements, the agency, or the GSA on behalf of the agency, conducts the procurement. The user agency, or the GSA on its
behalf, evaluates the user agency’s requirements and initiates a competition limited to GSA Schedule qualified contractors. GSA Schedule contracts are designed to provide the user agency with reduced procurement time and lower procurement
costs. Similar to IDIQ contracts, at the time a GSA Schedule contract is awarded, a contractor may have limited or no visibility as to the ultimate amount of services or products that the U.S. Government will purchase under the contract.

We often team with other parties, including our competitors, to submit bids for large U.S Government procurements or other
opportunities where we believe that the combination of services and products that we can provide as a team will help us win and perform the contract. Our relationships with our teammates, including whether we serve as the prime contractor or as a
subcontractor, vary with each contract opportunity and typically depend on the program, contract or customer requirements, as well as the relative size, qualifications, capabilities, customer relationships and experience of our company and our
teammates.

Contracting with the U.S. Government also subjects us to substantial regulation and unique risks, including the U.S. Government’s
ability to cancel any contract at any time. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. These regulations and risks are described in more detail
below under “Business–Regulation” and “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART I









Contract Types

Generally, the type of contract for our services and products is determined by or negotiated with the U.S. Government and may depend on certain factors, including the type and complexity of the work to be
performed, degree and timing of the responsibility to be assumed by the contractor for the costs of performance, the extent of price competition and the amount and nature of the profit incentive offered to the contractor for achieving or exceeding
specified standards or goals. We generate revenues under several types of contracts, including the following:



•Cost-reimbursement contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee. This type of contract is generally
used when uncertainties involved in contract performance do not permit costs to be estimated with sufficient accuracy to use a fixed-price contract. Cost-reimbursement contracts generally subject us to lower risk, but generally require us to use our
best efforts to accomplish the scope of the work within a specified time and amount of costs.



•Time-and-materials (T&M) contracts typically provide for negotiated fixed hourly rates for specified categories of direct labor plus reimbursement of other
direct costs. This type of contract is generally used when there is uncertainty of the extent or duration of the work to be performed by the contractor at the time of contract award or it is not possible to anticipate costs with any reasonable
degree of confidence. On T&M contracts, we assume the risk of providing appropriately qualified staff to perform these contracts at the hourly rates set forth in the contracts over the period of performance of the contracts.



•Fixed-price-level-of-effort (FP-LOE) contracts are substantially similar to T&M contracts except they require a specified level of effort over a stated
period of time on work that can be stated only in general terms. This type of contract is generally used when the contractor is required to perform an investigation or study in a specific research and development area and to provide a report showing
the results achieved based on the level of effort. Payment is based on the effort expended rather than the results achieved.



•Firm-fixed-price (FFP) contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products, systems and/or services. This type of contract is generally used when the
government acquires products and services on the basis of reasonably definitive specifications and which have a determinable fair and reasonable price. These contracts offer us potential increased profits if we can complete the work at lower costs
than planned. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns.

Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or products provided, as well as the
achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower
profitability than FFP contracts. For the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract for fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, see “Key Financial Metrics—Contract Types” in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Backlog

Backlog represents the estimated amount of future revenues to be recognized under negotiated contracts as work is performed. Our backlog consists of
funded backlog and negotiated unfunded backlog, each of which are described in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to
recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenues within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. Government may cancel any contract at any time. In addition, certain contracts with commercial customers include provisions that allow the
customer to cancel at any time. Most of our contracts have cancellation terms that would permit us to recover all or a portion of our incurred costs and fees for work performed. For additional discussion and analysis of backlog, see “Key
Financial Metrics—Bookings and Backlog” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Competition

Competition for contracts is
intense and we often compete against a large number of established multinational corporations which may have greater financial capabilities than we do. We also compete against smaller, more specialized companies that concentrate their resources on
particular areas, as well as the U.S. Government’s own capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers. As a result of the diverse requirements of the U.S. Government and our commercial customers, we frequently collaborate with
other companies to compete for large contracts, and bid against these team members in other situations. We believe that our principal competitors currently include the following companies:



•the engineering and technical services divisions of large defense contractors which provide U.S. Government IT services in addition to other hardware systems and
products, including such companies as The Boeing Company, General Dynamics Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, BAE Systems plc, L-3 Communications Corporation and Raytheon Company;



SAIC,
Inc. Annual Report  5




PART I









•contractors focused principally on technical services, including U.S. Government IT services, such as Battelle Memorial Institute, Booz Allen Hamilton Inc., CACI
International Inc, ManTech International Corporation, Serco Group plc and SRA International, Inc.;



•diversified commercial and U.S. Government IT providers, such as Accenture plc, Computer Sciences Corporation, HP Enterprise Services, International Business
Machines Corporation and Unisys Corporation;



•contractors who provide engineering, consulting, design and construction services, such as Jacobs Engineering Group, URS Corporation, KBR, Inc. and CH2M Hill
Companies Ltd.; and



•contractors focused on supplying homeland security product solutions, including American Science and Engineering, Inc., OSI Systems, Inc., L-3 Communications
Corporation, General Electric Company and Smiths Group plc and contractors providing supply chain management and other logistics services, including Agility Logistics, Inc. (a subsidiary of Agility Public Warehousing Company K.S.C.).

We compete on various factors including, our technical expertise and qualified professional and/or security-cleared personnel, our
ability to deliver innovative cost-effective solutions in a timely manner, successful program execution, our reputation and standing with customers, pricing and the size and geographic presence of our company.

The U.S. Government has indicated that it intends to increase industry competition for future procurement of products and services, which has led to fewer sole
source awards and more emphasis on cost competitiveness and affordability. In addition, procurement initiatives to improve efficiency, refocus priorities and enhance best practices could result in fewer new opportunities for our industry as a whole,
which would intensify competition within the industry as companies compete for a more limited set of new programs.

Patents and
Proprietary Information

Our technical services and products are not generally dependent upon patent protection, although we do selectively seek
patent protection. We claim a proprietary interest in certain of our products, software programs, methodologies and know-how. This proprietary information is protected by copyrights, trade secrets, licenses, contracts and other means. We selectively
pursue opportunities to license or transfer our technologies to third parties.

In connection with the performance of services, the U.S. Government has
certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under U.S. Government-funded contracts and subcontracts. Generally, the U.S. Government may disclose or license such information to third parties, including, in
some instances, our competitors. In the case of some subcontracts that we perform, the prime contractor may also have certain rights to the programs and products that we develop under the subcontract.

Research and Development

We conduct
research and development activities under customer-funded contracts and with company-funded internal research and development (IR&D) funds. IR&D efforts consist of projects involving basic research, applied research, development, and systems
and other concept formulation studies. IR&D expenses are included in selling, general and administrative expenses and are generally allocated to U.S. Government contracts. In fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, our company-funded IR&D expense was
$93 million, $55 million and $49 million, respectively. We charge expenses for research and development activities performed under customer contracts directly to cost of revenues.

Seasonality

The U.S. Government’s fiscal year ends on September 30 of each year. It
is not uncommon for U.S. Government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the timeframe leading up to the end of its fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds, which may favorably impact our
third fiscal quarter ending October 31. In addition, as a result of the cyclical nature of the U.S. Government budget process and a greater number of holidays in our fourth fiscal quarter ending January 31, as compared to our third fiscal
quarter ending October 31, we typically experience sequentially higher revenues in our third fiscal quarter and lower revenues in our fourth fiscal quarter. For selected quarterly financial data, see Note 20 of the combined notes to
consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Regulation

We are heavily regulated in most of the fields in which we operate. We provide services and products to numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including
agencies of the DoD, the intelligence community and DHS. When working with these and other U.S. Government agencies and entities, we must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of contracts. Among
other things, these laws and regulations:



•require certification and disclosure of all cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;



6  SAIC, Inc.
Annual Report




PART I









•define allowable and unallowable costs and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under various cost-based U.S. Government contracts;



•require reviews by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA), Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA) and other U.S. Government agencies of compliance with
government standards for accounting and management internal control systems;



•restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products and technical data; and



•require us not to compete for or to divest work if an organizational conflict of interest, as defined by these laws and regulations, related to such work exists
and/or cannot be appropriately mitigated.

The U.S. Government may revise its procurement practices or adopt new contract rules and
regulations at any time. In order to help ensure compliance with these complex laws and regulations, all of our employees are required to complete ethics training and other compliance training relevant to their position.

Some of our operations and service offerings involve access to and use by us of personally identifiable information and/or protected health information, which
activities are regulated by extensive federal and state privacy and data security laws requiring organizations to provide certain privacy protections and security safeguards for such information.

Internationally, we are subject to special U.S. Government laws and regulations, local government laws and regulations and procurement policies and practices
(including laws and regulations relating to bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings) and varying currency, political and economic risks.

Environmental Matters

Employees and Consultants

As of January 31, 2012, we employed approximately 41,100 full and part-time employees. We also utilize consultants to provide specialized technical and other
services on specific projects. To date, we have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.

The highly technical and complex services and products that we provide are dependent upon the availability of professional, administrative and technical personnel having high levels of training and skills and, in
many cases, security clearances. Due to the increased competition for qualified personnel, it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which has affected and may to continue to affect
our growth. We intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, develop and retain qualified employees.
