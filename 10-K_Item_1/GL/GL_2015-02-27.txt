Annuities



Annuity products include single-premium and flexible-premium deferred
annuities. Annuities in each of the three years ending December 31, 2014 comprised less than 1% of premium.



Pricing



Premium
rates for life and health insurance products are established using assumptions as to future mortality, morbidity, persistency, and expenses. These assumptions are based on Company experience and projected investment earnings. Revenues for individual
life and health insurance products are primarily derived from premium income, and, to a lesser extent, through policy charges to the policyholder account values on annuity products and certain individual life products. Profitability is affected to
the extent actual experience deviates from the assumptions made in pricing and to the extent investment income varies from that which is required for policy reserves.



Collections for annuity products and certain life products are not
recognized as revenues but are added to policyholder account values. Revenues from these products are derived from charges to the account balances for insurance risk and administrative costs. Profits are earned to the extent these revenues exceed
actual costs. Profits are also earned from investment income on the deposits invested in excess of the amounts credited to policyholder accounts.

Underwriting



The underwriting standards of each Torchmark insurance subsidiary are established by management. Each subsidiary uses information from the
application and, in some cases, telephone interviews with applicants, inspection reports, pharmacy data, doctors’ statements and/or medical examinations to determine whether a policy should be issued in accordance with the application, with a
different rating, with a rider, with reduced coverage or rejected.



Reserves



The life insurance policy reserves reflected in Torchmark’s financial statements as future policy benefits are calculated based on generally
accepted accounting principles (GAAP). These reserves, with premiums to be received in the future and the interest thereon compounded annually at assumed rates, must be sufficient to cover policy and contract obligations as they mature. Generally,
the mortality and persistency assumptions used in the calculations of reserves are based on Company experience. Similar reserves are held on most of the health policies written by Torchmark’s insurance subsidiaries, since these policies
generally are issued on a guaranteed-renewable basis. The assumptions used in the calculation of Torchmark’s reserves are reported inNote 1—Significant Accounting Policiesin theNotes to Consolidated Financial
Statements.Reserves for annuity products and certain life products consist of the policyholders’ account values and are increased by policyholder deposits and interest credited and are decreased by policy charges and benefit
payments.



Investments



The nature, quality, and percentage mix of insurance company
investments are regulated by state laws. The investments of Torchmark insurance subsidiaries consist predominantly of high-quality, investment-grade securities. Fixed maturities represented 97% of total investments at fair value at December 31,
2014. (SeeNote 4—Investmentsin theNotes toConsolidated Financial StatementsandManagement’s Discussion and Analysis.)



Competition



Torchmark competes with other insurance carriers through policyholder service, price, product design, and sales efforts. While there are insurance
companies competing with Torchmark, no individual company dominates any of Torchmark’s life or health markets.



Torchmark’s health insurance products compete with, in addition to the products of other health insurance carriers, health maintenance
organizations, preferred provider organizations, and other health care-related institutions which provide medical benefits based on contractual agreements.



Management believes Torchmark companies operate at lower policy acquisition and administrative expense levels than peer companies. This allows
Torchmark to have competitive rates while maintaining higher underwriting margins.



Regulation



Insurance.Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision in the states in which they do business. The
laws of the various states establish agencies with broad administrative and supervisory powers which include, among other things, granting and revoking licenses to transact business, regulating trade practices, licensing agents, approving policy
forms, approving certain premium rates, setting minimum reserve and loss ratio requirements, determining the form and content of required financial statements, and prescribing the type and amount of investments permitted. They are also required to
file detailed annual reports with supervisory agencies, and records of their business are subject to examination at any time. Under the rules of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), insurance companies are examined
periodically by one or more of the supervisory agencies.







Index to Financial Statements

Risk Based Capital.The NAIC requires a risk based capital formula be
applied to all life and health insurers. The risk based capital formula is a threshold formula rather than a target capital formula. It is designed only to identify companies that require regulatory attention and is not to be used to rate or rank
companies that are adequately capitalized. All Torchmark insurance subsidiaries are more than adequately capitalized under the risk based capital formula.



Guaranty Assessments.State guaranty laws provide for assessments from insurance companies to be placed into a fund
which is used, in the event of failure or insolvency of an insurance company, to fulfill the obligations of that company to its policyholders. The amount which a company is assessed is based on its proportional share of the premium in each state.
Assessments are recoverable to a great extent as offsets against state premium taxes.



Medicare Part D.The Medicare Part D program is regulated at the federal level by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). This agency periodically examines
Torchmark’s participating subsidiaries.



Holding
Company.States have enacted legislation requiring registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies domiciled within their respective jurisdictions that control or are controlled by other corporations so as to
constitute a holding company system. Torchmark and its subsidiaries have registered as a holding company system pursuant to such legislation in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio, and New York.



Insurance holding company system statutes and regulations impose various limitations on investments in subsidiaries, and
may require prior regulatory approval for material transactions between insurers and affiliates and for the payment of certain dividends and other distributions.



Personnel



At the end of 2014, Torchmark had 2,980 employees.
