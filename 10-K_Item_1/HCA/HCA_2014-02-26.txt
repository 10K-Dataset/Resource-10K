Item 1.Business

General

HCA Holdings, Inc. is one of the leading health
care services companies in the United States. At December 31, 2013, we operated 165 hospitals, comprised of 159 general, acute care hospitals; five psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation hospital. In addition, we operated 115
freestanding surgery centers. Our facilities are located in 20 states and England.

The terms
“Company,” “HCA,” “we,” “our” or “us,” as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates prior to the Corporate Reorganization (as defined
below) and to HCA Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates after the Corporate Reorganization. The term “affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Holdings, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are
partners. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA, and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive array of quality health care services in the most cost-effective
manner possible. Our general, acute care hospitals typically provide a full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as
diagnostic and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care services are provided by our general, acute care hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers and rehabilitation facilities. Our psychiatric hospitals provide a
full range of mental health care services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of or funds sponsored
by Bain Capital Partners, LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., BAML Capital Partners and HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. (collectively, the “Investors”) and by members of management and certain other investors. The
transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and liabilities.

During March 2011, we completed the initial public offering of 87,719,300 shares of our common stock. Certain of our stockholders also sold 57,410,700 shares of our common stock in this
offering. During December 2012, February 2013 and November 2013, certain Investors sold 32,000,000 shares, 50,000,000 shares and 30,000,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the
selling stockholders in any of these offerings. Our common stock is traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol “HCA”).

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. Our principal executive offices are located at One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and our
telephone number is (615) 344-9551.

Corporate Reorganization

On November 22, 2010, HCA Inc. reorganized by creating a new holding company structure (the “Corporate
Reorganization”). We are the parent company, and HCA Inc. is our 100% owned direct subsidiary. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, HCA Inc.’s outstanding shares of capital stock were automatically converted, on a share for share
basis, into identical shares of our common stock. As a result of the Corporate Reorganization, we are deemed the successor registrant to HCA Inc. under the Exchange Act. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, we became a guarantor but did not
assume the debt of HCA Inc.’s outstanding secured notes.







Following the Corporate Reorganization, the right to receive HCA Inc.’s
common stock under its various compensation plans and agreements automatically converted into rights for the same number of shares of our common stock, with the same rights and conditions as the corresponding HCA Inc. rights prior to the Corporate
Reorganization.

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while
growing our business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:



•grow our presence in existing markets;



•achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures;



•recruit and employ physicians to meet the need for high quality health services;



•continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability; and



•selectively pursue a disciplined development strategy.

Health Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate
hospitals; freestanding surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.

At December 31, 2013, we owned and operated 159 general, acute care hospitals with 42,240 licensed beds. Most of our
general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care hospitals also provide outpatient services such as
outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made up of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical research and education programs. However, some of our
hospitals are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other education programs.







At December 31, 2013, we operated five psychiatric hospitals with 556
licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities, which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers
(“ASCs”), freestanding emergency care facilities, diagnostic and imaging centers, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and various other facilities. These
outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each
partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or member that is an affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care facilities, including patient safety programs; ethics and compliance programs; national supply contracts; equipment
purchasing and leasing contracts; accounting, financial and clinical systems; governmental reimbursement assistance; construction planning and coordination; information technology systems and solutions; legal counsel; human resources services; and
internal audit services.

Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and
provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g.,
medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.

We receive payments for patient services from the federal government under the Medicare program, state governments under
their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans, private insurers and directly from patients. Our revenues from third-party payers and the uninsured for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 are summarized in the
following table (dollars in millions):

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance
benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, which provides hospital and medical
benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals







located in the United States are eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs. Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established
hospital gross charges for the services provided.

Medicare

In addition to the reimbursement reductions and adjustments discussed below, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the
“BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. These automatic spending
reductions began on March 1, 2013, with CMS imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims beginning on April 1, 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2024.

Inpatient Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we
receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the
patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group (“MS-DRG”). MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis.
MS-DRG weights represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” receive PPS
reimbursement for inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional
“outlier” payments.

MS-DRG rates are updated, and MS-DRG weights are recalibrated, using
cost-relative weights each federal fiscal year (which begins October 1). The index used to update the MS-DRG rates (the “market basket”) gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals and entities outside the health
care industry in purchasing goods and services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Law”), provides for annual decreases
to the market basket, including the following reductions for each of the following federal fiscal years: 0.3% in 2014; 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the
annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics (“BLS”) 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the inpatient PPS by $112.6 billion from 2010 to 2019. The American Taxpayer
Relief Act of 2012 requires a negative







documentation and coding adjustment for four years beginning in federal fiscal year 2014. It is estimated that this documentation and coding adjustment will reduce Medicare inpatient PPS payments
by $10.5 billion. A decrease in payment rates or an increase in rates that is below the increase in our costs may adversely affect our results of operations.

For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS increased the MS-DRG rate by 2.8%. This increase reflected a 2.6% market basket increase, the 0.1% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.7%
productivity adjustment, a negative 1.9% prospective documentation and coding adjustment and a positive 2.9% retrospective documentation and coding adjustment. For federal fiscal year 2014, CMS issued a final rule that results in a net increase of
0.7%. This increase reflects a 2.5% market basket increase, the 0.3% reduction required by the Health Reform Law, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment, a negative 0.8% prospective documentation and coding adjustment and a negative 0.2% adjustment
to offset projected spending increases associated with new admission and medical review criteria for inpatient services commonly known as the “two midnight rule.” Under the rule, Medicare beneficiaries are only to be admitted as inpatients
when there is a reasonable expectation that the hospital care is medically necessary and will be required across two midnights, absent unusual circumstances. Compliance with the two midnight rule was required beginning October 1, 2013 and will
become subject to Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) audits beginning October 1, 2014.

CMS has
implemented or is implementing a number of programs and requirements intended to transform Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and services. For example, hospitals receive a 2% reduction to their market basket
updates if they fail to submit data for patient care quality indicators to the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, hospitals that do not participate will lose an
additional one-quarter of the percentage increase in their payment updates. All of our hospitals paid under the Medicare inpatient PPS are participating in the quality initiative by submitting the requested quality data. While we will endeavor to
comply with all data submission requirements as additional requirements continue to be added, our submissions may not be deemed timely or sufficient to entitle all of our hospitals to the full market basket adjustment.

Further, Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG if a selected
hospital acquired condition (“HAC”) was not present on admission. In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. There are currently 11 categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, CMS
has established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The Health Reform Law provides for reduced payments based on a
hospital’s HAC rates. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating Medicare payments.

The Health Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to hospitals based on readmission rates. Beginning in federal
fiscal year 2013 and continuing in each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess” readmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia
or other conditions that may be designated by CMS. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excess readmissions for these conditions receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the
excess readmission standard. The amount by which payments are reduced is determined by comparing the hospital’s performance for each condition using three years of discharge data to a risk-adjusted national average, subject to a cap established
by CMS. The reduction in payments to hospitals with excess readmissions was capped at 1% for federal fiscal year 2013, but this reduction increased to 2% for federal fiscal year 2014, and will increase to 3% for federal fiscal year 2015 and
thereafter. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.

The Health Reform Law additionally
establishes a hospital value-based purchasing program to further link payments to quality and efficiency. For each federal fiscal year, CMS will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by the following: 1.25% for 2014; 1.5% for
2015; 1.75% for 2016; and 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. The total amount collected from these reductions is pooled and used to fund payments to







reward hospitals that meet certain quality performance standards established by CMS. CMS scores each hospital based on achievement (relative to other hospitals) and improvement ranges (relative
to the hospital’s own past performance) for each applicable performance standard. Because the Health Reform Law provides that the pool will be fully distributed, hospitals that meet or exceed the quality performance standards receive greater
reimbursement under the value-based purchasing program than they would have otherwise. Hospitals that do not achieve the necessary quality performance receive reduced Medicare inpatient hospital payments. Hospitals are scored based on a weighted
average of patient experience scores using the Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems survey and certain clinical measures. In federal fiscal year 2014, there are 17 measures by which hospitals will be scored. CMS estimates
that it will distribute $1.1 billion in federal fiscal year 2014 to hospitals under the value-based purchasing program.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS established an outlier threshold of $21,821, and for
federal fiscal year 2014, CMS reduced the outlier threshold to $21,748. We do not anticipate that the decrease to the outlier threshold for federal fiscal year 2014 will have a material impact on our results of operations.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for
physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services, nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by independent diagnostic testing
facilities.

Rehabilitation

CMS reimburses inpatient
rehabilitation facilities (“IRFs”) on a PPS basis. Under the IRF PPS, patients are classified into case mix groups based upon impairment, age, comorbidities (additional diseases or disorders from which the patient suffers) and functional
capability. IRFs are paid a predetermined amount per discharge that reflects the patient’s case mix group and is adjusted for area wage levels, low-income patients, rural areas and high-cost outliers. The Health Reform Law also provides for
reductions to the market basket update, including the following reductions for each of the following federal fiscal years: 0.3% in 2014; 0.2% in 2015 and 2016 and 0.75% in 2017, 2018 and 2019. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law
provides for the annual market basket update to be further reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving







average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. At the time of enactment, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity adjustments would reduce Medicare payments
under the IRF PPS by $5.7 billion from 2010 to 2019. For federal fiscal year 2013, CMS updated inpatient rehabilitation rates by 1.9%, which reflected a 2.7% market basket increase, a negative 0.7% productivity adjustment and a 0.1% reduction
required by the Health Reform Law. For federal fiscal year 2014, CMS has issued a final rule updating inpatient rehabilitation rates by 1.8%, which reflects a 2.6% market basket increase, a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment and a 0.3% reduction
required by the Health Reform Law. In addition, beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, IRFs are required to report quality measures to CMS or they will receive a 2% reduction to the market basket update.

In order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent
12-month CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to
pre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold, or other criteria to be classified as an IRF, will be paid under the
acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2013, we had one rehabilitation hospital and 48 hospital rehabilitation units.

Psychiatric

Ambulatory Surgery Centers

CMS reimburses ASCs
using a predetermined fee schedule. Reimbursements for ASC overhead costs are limited to no more than the overhead costs paid to hospital outpatient departments under the Medicare hospital outpatient PPS for the same procedure. If CMS determines
that a procedure is commonly performed in a physician’s office, the ASC reimbursement for that procedure is limited to the reimbursement allowable under the Medicare Part B Physician Fee Schedule, with limited exceptions. All surgical
procedures, other than those that pose a significant safety risk or generally require an overnight stay, are payable as ASC procedures. From time to time, CMS considers expanding the services that may be performed in ASCs, which may result in more
Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in hospitals being moved to ASCs, reducing surgical volume in our hospitals. Also, more Medicare procedures that historically have been performed in ASCs may be







moved to physicians’ offices. Commercial third-party payers may adopt similar policies. For each federal fiscal year, the Health Reform Law provides for the annual market basket update to be
reduced by a productivity adjustment based on the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For calendar year 2014, CMS has issued a final rule that provides for a 1.2% annual update to ASC payments, which
includes the market basket update of 1.7% and a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment. In addition, CMS has also established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on specified quality measures will receive a 2%
reduction in reimbursement.

Physician Services

Physician services are reimbursed under the physician fee schedule (“PFS”) system, under which CMS has assigned
a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a
combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a
geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. The aggregated amount is multiplied by a conversion factor that accounts for inflation and targeted growth in Medicare expenditures (as calculated by the
sustainable growth rate (“SGR”)) to arrive at the payment amount for each service. While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments
made under the PFS may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made.

The PFS rates are adjusted each year, and reductions in both current and future payments are anticipated. The SGR formula, if implemented as mandated by statute, would result in significant reductions to
payments under the PFS. These reductions are scheduled to be effective April 1, 2014. Since 2003, the U.S. Congress has passed multiple legislative acts delaying application of the SGR to the PFS. The most recent legislative delay provided a
0.5% increase in payment rates through March 31, 2014. The Senate Finance Committee, the House Ways and Means Committee, and the House Energy and Commerce Committee recently agreed upon legislation that, if enacted, will discontinue use of the
SGR formula, thereby eliminating the scheduled payment reductions. The legislation would also provide an annual payment increase of 0.5% beginning in 2014 and extending through 2018 and would maintain 2018 rates through 2023. In addition, the
legislation would require CMS to transition physician payments to a more value-based model beginning in 2018.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area differences in wage levels by a factor
(“wage index”) reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level and taking into account occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index changes, while slightly negative in the
aggregate, is not anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2014. Based on the Health Reform Law’s mandate, HHS submitted recommendations on reform to the Medicare wage index system, but Congress has not yet acted on the proposed
reforms.

Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion of bad debts resulting from deductible and coinsurance
amounts that are uncollectable from Medicare beneficiaries. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Jobs Creation Act of 2012 (the “Jobs Creation Act”) reduced the percentage of bad debt amounts that Medicare reimburses from 70% to 65%. These
reductions were intended to offset, in part, the impact of the legislative delay of the SGR reductions in physician compensation under the PFS. The U.S. Congress is considering legislation to address the SGR reductions, but has not yet enacted it
into law.

As required by the MMA, CMS has implemented contractor reform whereby CMS competitively bids the
Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 15 Medicare Administrative Contractors (“MACs”), which are geographically assigned and service both Part A and Part B providers within a given







jurisdiction. CMS awarded initial contracts to all 15 MAC jurisdictions, but CMS is currently engaged in a consolidation strategy to move from 15 MAC jurisdictions to 10. While chain providers
had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, we chose to use the MACs assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. CMS periodically re-solicits bids, and the MAC servicing a geographic area can change as a
result of the bid competition. MAC transition periods can impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow.

Under the RAC program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service Medicare program. CMS has implemented
the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis as required by statute. The compensation for the RACs is based on their review of claims submitted to Medicare for billing compliance, including correct coding and medical necessity, and the amount of
overpayments and underpayments they identify.

Historically, RACs have conducted their reviews on a
post-payment basis. However, CMS has also established the Recovery Audit Prepayment Review (“RAPR”) demonstration, that allows RACs to perform prepayment reviews. Under the RAPR demonstration, RACs conduct prepayment reviews on certain
types of claims that historically result in high rates of improper payments, beginning with claims for short stay inpatient hospital services. These reviews focus on seven states (Florida, California, Michigan, Texas, New York, Louisiana and
Illinois) with high populations of fraud and error-prone providers and four states (Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and Missouri) with high claims volumes of short inpatient hospital stays. The RAPR demonstration began in 2012 and runs for a
three year period.

We have established policies and procedures to respond to the RAC requests and payment
denials. Payment recoveries resulting from RAC reviews and denials are appealable through administrative and judicial processes, and we pursue reversal of adverse determinations at appropriate appeal levels. We are incurring additional costs related
to responding to RAC requests and denials, including costs associated with responding to requests for records and pursuing the reversal of payment denials and losses associated with overpayments that are not reversed upon appeal. Amounts that have
not been reversed upon appeal have not been significant, but the number and amount of claims subject to RAC review has been steadily increasing, and we expect this trend to continue. Further, HHS has suspended the assignment of new Medicare appeals
to Administrative Law Judges for at least two years beginning July 16, 2013, so that HHS may work through a backlog of appeals. Thus, we will experience a significant delay in appealing any RAC payment denials that occur during the suspension
period. Depending upon the growth of RAC programs and our success in appealing claims in future periods, our cash flows and results of operations could be negatively impacted.

Managed Medicare







Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under
approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. Although the Health Reform
Law requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (“FPL”) by 2014, states may opt out of the expansion without losing existing federal Medicaid
funding. For those states that expand Medicaid coverage, the Health Reform Law requires states to apply a “5% income disregard” to the Medicaid eligibility standard, so that Medicaid eligibility will effectively be extended to those with
incomes up to 138% of the FPL. A number of states, including Texas and Florida, have opted out of the Medicaid expansion, but these states could choose to implement the expansion at a later date. It is unclear how many states will ultimately decline
to implement the Medicaid expansion provisions of the law.

Because most states must operate with balanced
budgets and because the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic environment has increased the
budgetary pressures on most states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending growth, for Medicaid programs in many states.

Certain states in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid
programs. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid
systems. However, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for children until October 1, 2019.

Federal funds under the Medicaid program may not be used to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat
certain provider-preventable conditions. Each state Medicaid program must deny payments to providers for the treatment of health care-acquired conditions designated by CMS as well as other provider-preventable conditions that may be designated by
the state.

Congress has expanded the federal government’s involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse
in the Medicaid program through the Medicaid Integrity Program. CMS employs private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”), to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. In
addition to MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. The Health Reform Law increases federal funding for the MIC program and expands the RAC program’s scope to include Medicaid claims
by requiring all states to enter into contracts with RACs to audit payments to Medicaid providers.

Managed
Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient
enrollment, care management and claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of the designated entities,
usually a managed care organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific.

Enrollment in
managed Medicaid plans has increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to these
plans and may reduce enrollment in these plans.

Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment
Initiatives

Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, HHS established a Medicare Shared Savings Program
(“MSSP”) that seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of Accountable Care Organizations







(“ACOs”). The program allows certain providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) to voluntarily form ACOs and work together along
with other ACO participants to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational
efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of the program. Participants may
choose between two different ACO tracks, the first of which allows ACOs to share only in the savings under the MSSP. The second track requires ACOs to share in any savings and losses under the MSSP but offers ACOs a greater share of any savings
realized under the MSSP. As authorized by the Health Reform Law, certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. CMS has approved over 300 ACOs to participate in the MSSP.

Disproportionate Share Hospital
Payments

In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes
additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). DSH payments are determined annually based on certain statistical
information required by HHS and are calculated as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments.

Under the Health
Reform Law, beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, Medicare DSH payments are reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is effectively
pooled, and this pool will be reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age. Thus, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured nationally, the more the
Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each DSH hospital is then to be paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its estimated cost of providing uncompensated care. In 2013, CMS issued final rules to implement
these reductions.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may
receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define
which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law, as modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, provides for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal years 2016
through 2020 by the following amounts: 2016 ($1.2 billion); 2017 ($1.8 billion); 2018 ($5 billion); 2019 ($5.6 billion); and 2020 ($4 billion). The Jobs Creation Act, the







American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provide for additional Medicaid DSH reductions in federal fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 estimated at $4.1 billion,
$4.2 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. CMS has issued a final rule establishing the methodology for allocating the cuts among the states based on the volume of Medicaid inpatients and levels of uncompensated care in each state. States largely
retain the ability to manage the reduced allotments and to allocate these cuts among providers within the state.

TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health
care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. For outpatient services, TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a PPS that is similar to
that utilized for services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries.

Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.

Annual cost reports required
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the
final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports.

Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
including managed care plans and private insurance companies. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 30%, 30%, and 31% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.
Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases that were expected to yield 4% to 6% from managed care payers during 2013, there can be no
assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other health plans imposed by the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate
reimbursement increases or the impact of plans offered through the Exchanges on us.

Uninsured and Self-Pay
Patients

A high percentage of our uninsured patients are initially admitted through our emergency rooms.
For the year ended December 31, 2013, approximately 83% of our admissions of uninsured patients occurred through our emergency rooms. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (“EMTALA”) requires any hospital that participates in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either
stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for
treatment. The Health Reform Law requires health plans to reimburse hospitals for emergency services provided to enrollees without prior authorization and without regard to whether a participating provider contract is in place. Further, the Health
Reform Law contains provisions that seek to decrease the number of uninsured individuals, including requirements and incentives, most of which







became effective on January 1, 2014, for individuals to obtain, and large employers to provide, insurance coverage. These mandates may reduce the financial impact of screening for and
stabilizing emergency medical conditions. However, many factors are unknown regarding the impact of the Health Reform Law, including how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the law, the change, if any, in the
volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals, any changes to the payer mix and any increases in plan structures that result in higher patient responsibility amounts.

Electronic Health Record Incentives

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive
payments for eligible hospitals and for eligible professionals that adopt and meaningfully use certified electronic health record (“EHR”) technology and provides for penalties for eligible hospitals and eligible professionals that do not
adopt and meaningfully use EHR technology. Through December 2013, approximately $19 billion in incentive payments have been made through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs to eligible hospitals and eligible professionals.

Under the Medicare incentive program, eligible hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use will receive incentive payments
for up to four fiscal years. The Medicare incentive payment amount is the product of three factors: (1) an initial amount comprised of a base amount of $2,000,000, plus $200 for each acute care inpatient discharge, beginning with a
hospital’s 1,150th discharge of the applicable year and ending with a hospital’s 23,000th discharge of the applicable year; (2) the “Medicare share,” which is the sum of Medicare Part A and Part C acute care
inpatient-bed-days divided by the product of the total acute care inpatient-bed-days and a charity care factor; and (3) a transition factor applicable to the payment year. In order to maximize their incentive payments, acute care hospitals must
have begun participating in the incentive program by federal fiscal year 2013. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, acute care hospitals that have failed to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting
period will receive reduced market basket updates under inpatient PPS.

Eligible professionals who demonstrate
meaningful use are entitled to incentive payments for up to five payment years in an amount equal to 75% of their estimated Medicare allowed charges for covered professional services furnished during the relevant calendar year, subject to an annual
limit. Eligible professionals must have begun participating in the incentive payment program by calendar year 2012 in order to maximize their incentive payments and must participate by calendar year 2014 in order to receive any incentive payments.
Beginning in calendar year 2015, eligible professionals who have failed to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in an applicable prior reporting period will face Medicare payment reductions.

The Medicaid EHR incentive program is voluntary for states to implement. For participating states, the Medicaid EHR
incentive program provides incentive payments for acute care hospitals and eligible professionals that meet certain volume percentages of Medicaid patients, as well as children’s hospitals. Providers may only participate in a single
state’s Medicaid EHR incentive program. Eligible professionals can only participate in either the Medicaid incentive program or the Medicare incentive program and can change this election only one time. Eligible hospitals may participate in
both the Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs.

To qualify for incentive payments under the Medicaid
program, providers must either adopt, implement, upgrade or demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology during their first participation year or successfully demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in subsequent
participation years. Payments may be received for up to six participation years. For hospitals, the aggregate Medicaid EHR incentive amount is the product of two factors: (1) the overall EHR amount, which is comprised of a base amount of
$2,000,000 plus a discharge-related amount, multiplied by the Medicare share (which is set at one by statute) multiplied by a transition factor, and (2) the “Medicaid share,” which is the estimated Medicaid inpatient-bed days plus
estimated Medicaid managed care inpatient bed-days, divided by the product of the estimated total inpatient bed-days and a charity care factor. Under the Medicaid incentive program, eligible professionals may







receive payments based on their EHR costs, up to a total amount of $63,750, or for pediatricians, $42,500. There is no penalty for hospitals or professionals under Medicaid for failing to meet
EHR meaningful use requirements.

Hospital Utilization

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are the quality and market
position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is determined by its breadth of
services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local population, local economic conditions
and market penetration of managed care programs.

The following table sets forth certain operating statistics
for our health care facilities. Health care facility operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold weather months. The data set forth in this
table includes only those facilities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by most of our hospitals provide services similar to those
offered by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of freestanding specialty hospitals, surgery centers, emergency departments, urgent care centers and diagnostic and imaging centers in the geographic areas in which we operate has
increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing hospitals are more established than our hospitals. Some competing facilities are physician-owned or are owned by
tax-supported government agencies and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and
support are not available to our hospitals and may provide the tax-supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized
facilities, equipment and services that may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore,
our psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to
attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals, location, breadth of services, technology offered, quality and condition of the facilities and prices charged. The Health Reform Law requires
hospitals to publish annually a list of their standard charges for items and services. We have increased our focus on operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more convenient service for patients, and increased predictability
and efficiency for physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position of a hospital
are the number and quality of physicians affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the
hospitals’ medical staffs and to attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the
medical staff, the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients.
Our hospitals face competition from competitors that are implementing physician alignment strategies, such as employing physicians, acquiring physician practice groups and participating in ACOs or other clinical integration models.

Another major factor in the competitive position of our hospitals is our ability to negotiate service contracts with
purchasers of group health care services. Managed care plans attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services and obtain discounts from hospitals’ established gross charges. In addition, employers and traditional health insurers
continue to attempt to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established gross charges. Generally, hospitals compete for service contracts with group health care services purchasers on the
basis of price, market reputation, geographic location, quality and range of services, quality of the medical staff and convenience. Our future success will depend, in part, on







our ability to retain and renew our managed care contracts and enter into new managed care contracts on favorable terms. Other health care providers may impact our ability to enter into managed
care contracts or negotiate increases in our reimbursement and other favorable terms and conditions. For example, some of our competitors may negotiate exclusivity provisions with managed care plans or otherwise restrict the ability of managed care
companies to contract with us. The trend toward consolidation among non-government payers tends to increase their bargaining power over fee structures. In addition, as various provisions of the Health Reform Law are implemented, including the
Exchanges and limitations on rescissions of coverage and pre-existing condition exclusions, non-government payers may increasingly demand reduced fees or be unwilling to negotiate reimbursement increases. Most of the plans offered through the
Exchanges provide for narrow networks that restrict the number of participating providers or tiered networks that impose significantly higher cost sharing obligations on patients that obtain services from providers in a disfavored tier. The
importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from community to community, depending on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place limitations on a health care facility’s ability to expand services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes
in operations, may also have the effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws or that require other types of approvals for the establishment or expansion of certain facility types
or services. Before issuing a CON or other approval, these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. In those states that do not require state approval or that set relatively high levels of expenditures
before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing
with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider services by private and government payers remain ongoing
challenges.

Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected
by payer-required pre-admission authorization, utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. The Health Reform Law expanded the use of prepayment review by
Medicare contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or
construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and
services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation

Health care facility construction and operation are subject to numerous federal, state and local regulations relating to
the adequacy of medical care, equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures, maintenance of adequate records, fire prevention, rate-setting and compliance with building codes and environmental protection laws. Facilities are subject to
periodic inspection by governmental and other authorities to assure continued compliance with the various standards necessary for licensing and accreditation. We believe our health care facilities are properly licensed under applicable state laws.
Each of our acute care hospitals located in the United States is eligible to participate in Medicare and Medicaid programs and is accredited by The Joint Commission with the exception of three hospitals acquired in the third quarter of 2013 which
are accredited by Det Norske Veritas. If any facility were to lose its Medicare or Medicaid certification, the facility would be unable to receive reimbursement from federal health care programs. If any facility were to lose accreditation, the
facility would be subject to state surveys, potentially be subject to increased scrutiny by CMS and likely lose payment from non-government payers. Management believes our facilities are in substantial compliance with current applicable federal,
state, local and independent review body regulations and standards.







The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified, it may become necessary for us to make changes in our facilities,
equipment, personnel and services. The requirements for licensure, certification and accreditation also include notification or approval in the event of the transfer or change of ownership or certain other changes. Failure to provide required
notifications or obtain necessary approvals in these circumstances can result in the inability to complete an acquisition or change of ownership, loss of licensure, lapses in reimbursement or other penalties.

Certificates of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care facilities, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of
ownership and the addition of new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency to determine the public
need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or change ownership or other
penalties.

State Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital
revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not currently operate facilities in
states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating such reviews.

Federal Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by
statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with the numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the hospital’s participation in the federal health care
programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be imposed.

Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits
providers and others from directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted
this statute broadly and held that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform Law provides that
knowledge of the law or the intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per
violation and damages of up to three times the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The Health Reform Law provides that submission of a claim for
services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”).

The HHS Office of Inspector General (“OIG”), among other regulatory agencies, is responsible for identifying
and eliminating fraud, abuse and waste. The OIG carries out this mission through a nationwide program of audits, investigations and inspections. The OIG provides guidance to the industry through various methods including advisory opinions and
“Special Fraud Alerts.” These Special Fraud Alerts do not have the







The OIG also issues “Special Advisory Bulletins” as a means of providing guidance to health care providers.
These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint
venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of
giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care attributable in part to the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of
risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed
protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner
recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements,
obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices, freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty services.

The fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor or is identified in a Special Fraud
Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance does not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government
enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either
refer or influence the referral of patients to our hospitals, other health care facilities and employed physicians, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar
relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients are referred from our facilities and other providers. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into







the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors, certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships
with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.

Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources and referral recipients have been structured to comply with current law and available interpretations, there can be no
assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act
and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs.

Stark Law

Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations implementing the Stark Law. While these regulations
were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or
judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot
assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

Similar State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians
for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain self-referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad because they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their
interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure.







Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other
fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act, and in some cases may result in penalties of up to three
times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law,
especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of
at least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program.

The Federal False Claims Act and
Similar State Laws

qui tam

qui tam

The Health Reform Law provides that submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. In some cases,
whistleblowers







and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false
claims under the FCA. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and
whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In addition, federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have
adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA and implementing regulations require the use of uniform electronic
data transmission standards for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. As required by the Health Reform
Law, HHS is in the process of adopting standards for additional electronic transactions and establishing operating rules to promote uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. In addition, HIPAA requires that each
provider use a National Provider Identifier. CMS has also published a final rule requiring the use of updated standard code sets for certain diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. Implementing the ICD-10 code sets will require
significant administrative changes. Use of the ICD-10 code sets is required beginning October 1, 2014.

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA extensively regulate the use and disclosure of
individually identifiable health information, known as “protected health information,” and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to
protect the security of such information. ARRA broadened the scope of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In addition, ARRA extends the application of certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations to business associates
(entities that handle protected health information on behalf of covered entities) and subjects business associates to civil and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations. HHS has implemented many of these ARRA provisions through a final
rule that became effective March 26, 2013. The final rule subjects business associates and their subcontractors to direct liability under the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and revises the requirements for agreements with business
associates. In addition, a covered entity may be subject to penalties as a result of a business associate violating HIPAA, if the business associate is found to be an agent of the covered entity. Compliance with the final rule was required beginning
September 23, 2013, except that existing business associate agreements may qualify for an extended compliance date of September 23, 2014.

Covered entities must report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered
entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500
individuals. In its 2013 final rule, HHS modified this breach notification requirement by creating a presumption that all non-permitted uses or disclosures of unsecured protected health information are breaches unless the covered entity or business
associate establishes that there is a low probability the information has been compromised. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving individually identifiable
information.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in civil and criminal
penalties, and ARRA has strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA, including requiring HHS to perform compliance audits, which may result in increased enforcement activity. For example, ARRA broadens the applicability of the criminal penalty
provisions to employees of covered entities and requires HHS to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. In addition, ARRA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions seeking







either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents. ARRA also significantly increases the amount of the
civil penalties, with penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. The 2013 final rule implemented many of the ARRA enforcement requirements. In the
rule, HHS removed the requirement that HHS attempt to resolve HIPAA violations through informal means, such as allowing a covered entity to implement a corrective action plan, prior to imposing penalties. Instead, HHS has the discretion to resolve
violations by moving directly to impose monetary penalties. We enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors our compliance. The HIPAA
privacy regulations and security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards.

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state
privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties. For example, the Federal Trade Commission uses its consumer protection authority to initiate
enforcement actions in response to data breaches.

EMTALA

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either
stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for
treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss
as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The
government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a
patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the
future. We believe our hospitals operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate Practice of
Medicine/Fee Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other
entities from employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the
recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the
physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public
attention, changes in government personnel and other factors have led to increased scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of







the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate
and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private
litigation.

Our substantial Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny
of our operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this
area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or industry practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken positions on a number of
issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been challenged in this manner. In
some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations.

Both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and coordination of civil and criminal
enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that focus on specific billing practices or
other suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of $350 million over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse, including $40 million in federal fiscal year 2014. In addition,
governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations. Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide
variety of routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges
and collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and
Medicaid billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may
receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as
adverse publicity.

Health Care Reform

The Health Reform Law changes how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of
uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs that tie reimbursement to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects
of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. Most of the provisions of the Health Reform Law that seek to
decrease the number of uninsured became effective January 1, 2014.

Expanded Coverage

Based on the CBO’s February 2014 projection, by 2022, the Health Reform Law will expand coverage to 25 million
additional individuals. This increased coverage will occur through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms.







Medicaid Expansion

As Medicaid is a joint federal and state program, the federal government provides states with “matching funds”
in a defined percentage, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (“FMAP”). Beginning in 2014, states will receive an enhanced FMAP for the individuals enrolled in Medicaid pursuant to the Health Reform Law. The FMAP percentage
is as follows: 100% for calendar years 2014 through 2016; 95% for 2017; 94% in 2018; 93% in 2019; and 90% in 2020 and thereafter. CMS has indicated that states that only partially expand their Medicaid programs will not receive an enhanced FMAP.

The Health Reform Law also provides that the federal government will subsidize states that create
non-Medicaid plans for residents whose incomes are greater than 133% of the FPL but do not exceed 200% of the FPL. Approved state plans will be eligible to receive federal funding. The amount of that funding per individual will be equal to 95% of
subsidies that would have been provided for that individual had he or she enrolled in a health plan offered through one of the Exchanges, as discussed below.

Historically, states often have attempted to reduce Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. However, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least
maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for children until October 1, 2019.

Private Sector Expansion

The expansion of health coverage
through the private sector as a result of the Health Reform Law occurs through new requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. Health insurers must keep their annual nonmedical costs lower than 15% of premium revenue for
the group market and lower than 20% in the small group and individual markets or rebate to enrollees the amount spent in excess of the percentage. In addition, health insurers are not permitted to deny coverage to children based upon a pre-existing
condition and must allow dependent care coverage for children up to 26 years old. As of January 1, 2014, health insurers are prohibited from imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon pre-existing
conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage.

Larger employers will be subject to new requirements and incentives to provide health insurance benefits to their full
time employees. Employers with 50 or more employees that do not offer health insurance will be held subject to a penalty if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through an Exchange. The employer penalties will range from $2,000 to
$3,000 per employee, subject to certain thresholds and conditions. This requirement was originally effective January 1, 2014, but has been delayed until January 1, 2015. For employers with 50 to 99 employees, this requirement has been
further delayed until January 1, 2016.







The Health Reform Law uses various means to induce individuals who do not
have health insurance to obtain coverage. Effective January 1, 2014, individuals are required to maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits or pay a tax penalty. The penalty in most cases is the greater of $95 or 1% of
income in 2014, $325 or 2% of income in 2015, $695 or 2.5% of income in 2016, and indexed to a cost of living adjustment in subsequent years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), in consultation with HHS, is responsible for enforcing the
tax penalty, although the Health Reform Law limits the availability of certain IRS enforcement mechanisms. In addition, for individuals and families below 400% of the FPL, the cost of obtaining health insurance through the Exchanges will be
subsidized by the federal government. Those with lower incomes will be eligible to receive greater subsidies. It is anticipated that those at the lowest income levels will have the majority of their premiums subsidized by the federal government, in
some cases in excess of 95% of the premium amount.

Public Program Spending

The Health Reform Law provides for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care program spending reductions between 2010 and 2019. In March 2010, CMS estimated Medicare fee-for-service reductions from
2010 to 2019 would be $233 billion and the Medicare and Medicaid DSH reductions would be an additional $64 billion. In July 2012, the CBO estimated that from 2013 to 2022, the Health Reform Law reductions would include $415 billion in Medicare
fee-for-service market basket and productivity reimbursement reductions, the majority of which will come from hospitals. The CBO estimate included an additional $56 billion in reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH funding.

Payments for Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgery Centers

Inpatient Market Basket and Productivity Adjustment. Under the Medicare program, hospitals receive
reimbursement under a PPS for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. CMS establishes fixed PPS payment amounts per inpatient discharge based on the patient’s assigned MS-DRG. These MS-DRG rates are updated each federal fiscal year,
which begins October 1, using a market basket index that takes into account inflation experienced by hospitals and other entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services.







The Health Reform Law provides for three types of annual reductions in the
market basket. The first is a general reduction of a specified percentage each federal fiscal year that began in 2010 and extends through 2019. The remaining reductions are as follows: 2014 (0.3%); 2015 (0.2%); 2016 (0.2%); 2017 (0.75%); 2018
(0.75%); and 2019 (0.75%).

The second type of reduction to the market basket is a “productivity
adjustment” that was implemented by HHS beginning in federal fiscal year 2012. The amount of that reduction is the projected nationwide productivity gains over the preceding 10 years. To determine the projection, HHS uses the BLS 10-year
moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity. For federal fiscal year 2014, CMS has announced a negative 0.5% productivity adjustment to the market basket. In 2010, CMS estimated that the combined market basket and productivity
adjustments would reduce Medicare payments under the inpatient PPS by $112.6 billion from 2010 to 2019.

The
third type of reduction is in connection with the value-based purchasing program discussed in more detail below. For each federal fiscal year, CMS will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount for all discharges by the following: 1.25% for 2014; 1.5%
for 2015; 1.75% for 2016; and 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. For each federal fiscal year, the total amount collected from these reductions will be pooled and used to fund payments to hospitals that satisfy certain quality metrics. While some or
all of these reductions may be recovered if a hospital satisfies these quality metrics, the recovery amounts may be delayed.

If the aggregate of the three market basket reductions described above is more than the annual market basket adjustments made to account for inflation, there will be a reduction in the MS-DRG rates paid
to hospitals.

Quality-Based Payment Adjustments and Reductions for Inpatient Services.

Second, beginning in federal fiscal year 2013 and continuing
in each federal fiscal year, inpatient payments are reduced if a hospital experiences “excess readmissions” within the 30-day period from the date of discharge for heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia or other conditions that may be
designated by CMS. Hospitals with what CMS defines as “excess readmissions” for these conditions will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excess readmission
standard. The amount by which payments will be reduced if a hospital experiences excess readmissions is determined by comparison of the hospital’s readmission performance to a risk-adjusted national average and is subject to a cap established
by CMS. Each hospital’s performance is publicly reported by CMS.

Third, reimbursement will be reduced
based on a facility’s HAC rates. A HAC is a condition that is acquired by a patient while admitted as an inpatient in a hospital, such as a surgical site infection. Beginning in federal







fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating Medicare payments. In
addition, the Health Reform Law prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to treat HACs. CMS implemented this prohibition for services with dates beginning July 1, 2012.
States may add additional provider-preventable conditions to the list of HACs for which Medicaid reimbursement will not be allowed.

Outpatient Market Basket and Productivity Adjustment.Hospital outpatient services paid under PPS are classified into APCs. The APC payment rates are updated each calendar year based on
the market basket. The first two market basket changes outlined above — the general reduction and the productivity adjustment — apply to outpatient services as well as inpatient services, although these are applied on a calendar
year basis. The percentage changes specified in the Health Reform Law summarized above as the general reduction for inpatients — e.g., 0.2% in 2015 — are the same for outpatients.

Medicare and Medicaid DSH Payments.The Medicare DSH program provides for additional payments to
hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Under the Health Reform Law, beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, Medicare DSH payments are reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The
remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH is effectively pooled, and this pool will be reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years
of age. In other words, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment pool will be reduced. Each hospital is then paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its level
of uncompensated care, which was not the basis for DSH payments prior to implementation of the Health Reform Law. In 2013, CMS issued final rules to implement these reductions.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments.
The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. Although federal Medicaid law defines some level of hospitals that must
receive Medicaid DSH funding, states have broad discretion to define additional hospitals that also may qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law, as modified by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013,
provides for reductions to the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal years 2016 through 2020 by the following amounts: 2016 ($1.2 billion); 2017 ($1.8 billion); 2018 ($5 billion); 2019 ($5.6 billion); and 2020
($4 billion). The Jobs Creation Act and the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013 provide for additional Medicaid DSH reductions in federal fiscal years 2021, 2022 and 2023 estimated at $4.1 billion, $4.2
billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. CMS has issued a final rule establishing the methodology for allocating the cuts among the states based on the volume of Medicaid inpatients and levels of uncompensated care in each state. States largely
retain the ability to manage the reduced allotments and to allocate these cuts among providers within the state.

ACOs.Pursuant to the Health Reform Law, HHS established the MSSP, which seeks to promote accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. The MSSP allows certain
providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals) to voluntarily form ACOs and work together along with other ACO participants to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve
high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a
portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program. Participants may choose between two different ACO tracks, the first of which allows ACOs to share only in the savings under the MSSP. The second track requires ACOs to share in any savings and
losses under the MSSP but offers ACOs a greater share of any savings realized under the MSSP. As authorized by the Health Reform Law, certain waivers are available from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. CMS has approved over 300 ACOs to participate in
the MSSP.







Bundled Payment Pilot Programs.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers.The Health Reform Law reduces reimbursement for ASCs through a
productivity adjustment to the market basket similar to the productivity adjustment for inpatient and outpatient hospital services. In addition, CMS has established a quality reporting program for ASCs under which ASCs that fail to report on
required quality measures will receive a 2% reduction in reimbursement beginning with the calendar year 2014 payment determination.

Medicare Managed Care (Medicare Advantage or “MA”).Under the MA program, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide inpatient and outpatient
benefits to beneficiaries who enroll in such plans. In 2013, approximately 14.4 million Medicare beneficiaries elected to enroll in MA plans. Effective in 2014, the Health Reform Law requires MA plans to keep annual administrative costs lower
than 15% of annual premium revenue. The Health Reform Law reduces, over a three year period starting in 2012, premium payments to the MA plans such that CMS’ managed care per capita premium payments are, on average, equal to traditional
Medicare. In addition, the Health Reform Law implements fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings. As a result of these changes, payments to MA plans are estimated to be reduced by $138 to $145 billion between 2010
and 2019. These reductions to MA plan premium payments paid by the federal government may cause some plans to raise beneficiary premiums or limit benefits, which in turn might cause some Medicare beneficiaries to terminate their MA coverage and
enroll in traditional Medicare.

Physician-Owned Hospital Limitations

Over the last decade, we have faced competition from hospitals that have physician ownership. The Health Reform Law
prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals that participate in Medicare and
Medicaid after December 31, 2010. While the law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.







Program Integrity and Fraud and Abuse

The Health Reform Law makes several significant changes to health care fraud and abuse laws, provides additional
enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law:
(1) provides $350 million in increased federal funding over 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse; (2) expands the scope of the RAC program to include MA plans and Medicaid; (3) authorizes HHS, in consultation
with the OIG, to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services or a supplier “pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud;” (4) provides Medicare contractors with additional flexibility to conduct
random prepayment reviews; and (5) tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made by governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to include failure to timely repay identified overpayments.

Impact of Health Reform Law on the Company

The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health Reform Law may result in an increase in the number of patients
using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. In addition, the Health Reform Law provides for initiatives that create possible sources of additional revenue, such as ACOs. However, any positive effects of the Health Reform
Law could be offset, and the Company could be significantly impacted, by reductions to the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Substantial uncertainty remains regarding the net effect of the Health Reform Law on the Company because the resolution of a
number of material factors remains unclear, including the following:



•how many states will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions and under what terms;



•the potential for and impact of further delays in or complications related to implementation of the Health Reform Law (for example, there were
significant problems during the initial implementation of the Exchanges that negatively impacted the ability of individuals to enroll in Medicaid and to purchase health insurance);



•the possibility of enactment of additional federal or state health care reforms and possible changes to the Health Reform Law;



•our ability to participate in health insurance plans offered through the Exchanges and the terms of our participation as well as treatment of out of
network claims;



•how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the Health Reform Law (based on the CBO’s February 2014
estimates, by 2022, the Health Reform Law will expand coverage to 25 million additional individuals);



•what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered by private health
insurers;



•the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants in managed care programs;



•the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace of different types of coverage expansion;



•the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals;



•the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered individuals and individuals with existing coverage, including those covered through
the Exchanges and those who might be covered under the Medicaid program;



•the rate paid by state governments under the Medicaid program for newly covered individuals;



•the effect of the value-based purchasing provisions of the Health Reform Law on our hospitals’ revenues and the effects of other quality
programs;







•the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select the high deductible plans, since health insurers offering those kinds of products have
traditionally sought to pay lower rates to hospitals;



•the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are implemented (42% of our
revenues in 2013 were from Medicare and Medicaid);



•the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity adjustment to the market basket;



•the amount of the Medicare DSH reductions and the allocation of the Medicaid DSH reductions to our hospitals;



•how successful ACOs will be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement;



•the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments or coordination of care
programs;



•whether the Company’s revenues from Medicaid supplemental programs developed through a federally approved waiver program (“Waiver
Program”), will be adversely affected because there may be reductions in available state and local government funding for the programs; and



•the impact of efforts to repeal or revise the Health Reform Law and remaining or new federal lawsuits challenging its constitutionality.

General Economic and Demographic Factors

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. Budget deficits at federal, state and local
government entities have had a negative impact on spending for many health and human service programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and similar programs, which represent significant payer sources for our hospitals. The federal deficit, the growing
magnitude of Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United States population will continue to place pressure on federal health care programs. Other risks we face during periods of economic weakness and high unemployment include potential
declines in the population covered under managed care agreements, increased patient decisions to postpone or cancel elective and nonemergency health care procedures, increases in the uninsured and underinsured populations, increased adoption of
health plan structures that shift financial responsibility to patients and further difficulties in our collecting patient receivables for copayment and deductible amounts. The Health Reform Law seeks to decrease over time the number of uninsured
individuals, but it is difficult to predict the full impact of the Health Reform Law.

Compliance Program

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable
federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics
and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics line. The Health
Reform Law requires providers to implement core elements of compliance program criteria to be established by HHS, on a timeline to be established by HHS, as a condition of enrollment in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and we may have to modify
our compliance programs to comply with these new criteria.

Antitrust Laws

The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be
anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other







practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties.
Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission and the DOJ. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination
in the future that could adversely affect our operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the
environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, we
are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course of business. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to
$50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with
unrelated commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

We
purchase, from unrelated insurance companies, coverage for directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate. The directors and officers liability coverage includes a $5 million corporate deductible. In addition,
we will continue to purchase coverage for our directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of the property damage. These deductibles range from $500,000 per claim up to 5% of
the affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2013, we had approximately 215,000 employees, including approximately
53,000 part-time employees. References herein to “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to
employment. At December 31, 2013, certain employees at 38 of our domestic hospitals are represented by various labor unions. While no elections are expected in 2014, it is possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We consider
our employee relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse
and medical support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and
productivity.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and
physicians who are not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the
maintenance of certain performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing
board of the hospital, in accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their
affiliation with one of our hospitals at any time.

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and
benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs







could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and
the National Labor Relations Board’s (the “NLRB”) modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts. To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs
could increase materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect
labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.
