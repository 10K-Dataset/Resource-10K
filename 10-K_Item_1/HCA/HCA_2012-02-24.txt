Item 1.Business

General

HCA Holdings, Inc. is one of the leading health care services companies in the United States. At December 31, 2011,
we operated 163 hospitals, comprised of 157 general, acute care hospitals; five psychiatric hospitals; and one rehabilitation hospital. In addition, we operated 108 freestanding surgery centers. Our facilities are located in 20 states and
England.

The terms “Company,” “HCA,” “we,” “our” or “us,”
as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Inc. and its affiliates prior to the Corporate Reorganization (as defined below) and to HCA Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates after the Corporate Reorganization. The
term “affiliates” means direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Holdings, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners. The terms “facilities” or “hospitals” refer to entities owned
and operated by affiliates of HCA and the term “employees” refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.

Our primary objective is to provide a comprehensive array of quality health care services in the most cost-effective
manner possible. Our general, acute care hospitals typically provide a full range of services to accommodate such medical specialties as internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, as well as
diagnostic and emergency services. Outpatient and ancillary health care services are provided by our general, acute care hospitals, freestanding surgery centers, diagnostic centers and rehabilitation facilities. Our psychiatric hospitals provide a
full range of mental health care services through inpatient, partial hospitalization and outpatient settings.

On November 17, 2006, HCA Inc. was acquired by a private investor group, including affiliates of or funds sponsored
by Bain Capital Partners, LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., BAML Capital Partners and HCA founder, Dr. Thomas F. Frist, Jr. (collectively, the “Investors”) and by members of management and certain other investors. The
transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization in our financial statements, with no adjustments to the historical basis of our assets and liabilities.

During February 2011, our Board of Directors approved an increase in the number of our authorized shares to 1,800,000,000 shares of common stock and a 4.505-to-one split of our issued and outstanding
common shares. All common share and per common share amounts in these consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements reflect the 4.505-to-one split. During March 2011, we completed the initial public offering of
87,719,300 shares of our common stock at a price of $30.00 per share (before deducting underwriter discounts, commissions and other related offering expenses). Certain of our stockholders also sold 57,410,700 shares of our common stock in
this offering. We did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by the selling stockholders. Our common stock is now traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol “HCA”).

The Company was incorporated in Nevada in January 1990 and reincorporated in Delaware in September 1993. Our principal
executive offices are located at One Park Plaza, Nashville, Tennessee 37203, and our telephone number is (615) 344-9551.

Corporate
Reorganization

On November 22, 2010, HCA Inc. reorganized by creating a new holding company structure
(the “Corporate Reorganization”). We are the new parent company, and HCA Inc. is now our wholly-owned direct subsidiary. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, HCA Inc.’s outstanding shares of capital stock were automatically
converted, on a share for share basis, into identical shares of our common stock. As a result of the







Corporate Reorganization, we are deemed the successor registrant to HCA Inc. under the Exchange Act. As part of the Corporate Reorganization, we became a guarantor but did not assume the debt of
HCA Inc.’s outstanding secured notes.

We have assumed all of HCA Inc.’s obligations with respect to
the outstanding shares previously registered on Form S-8 for distribution pursuant to HCA Inc.’s stock incentive plan and have also assumed HCA Inc.’s other equity incentive plans that provide for the right to acquire HCA Inc.’s
common stock. The agreements and plans we assumed were each deemed to be automatically amended as necessary to provide that references therein to HCA Inc. now refer to HCA Holdings, Inc. Following the Corporate Reorganization, the right to receive
HCA Inc.’s common stock under its various compensation plans and agreements automatically converted into rights for the same number of shares of our common stock, with the same rights and conditions as the corresponding HCA Inc. rights prior to
the Corporate Reorganization.

Business Strategy

We are committed to providing the communities we serve with high quality, cost-effective health care while growing our
business, increasing our profitability and creating long-term value for our stockholders. To achieve these objectives, we align our efforts around the following growth agenda:



•grow our presence in existing markets;



•achieve industry-leading performance in clinical and satisfaction measures;



•recruit and employ physicians to meet the need for high quality health services;



•continue to leverage our scale and market positions to enhance profitability; and



•selectively pursue a disciplined development strategy.

Health Care Facilities

We currently own, manage or operate
hospitals; freestanding surgery centers; diagnostic and imaging centers; radiation and oncology therapy centers; comprehensive rehabilitation and physical therapy centers; and various other facilities.







At December 31, 2011, we owned and operated 157 general, acute care
hospitals with 40,988 licensed beds. Most of our general, acute care hospitals provide medical and surgical services, including inpatient care, intensive care, cardiac care, diagnostic services and emergency services. The general, acute care
hospitals also provide outpatient services such as outpatient surgery, laboratory, radiology, respiratory therapy, cardiology and physical therapy. Each hospital has an organized medical staff and a local board of trustees or governing board, made
up of members of the local community.

Our hospitals do not typically engage in extensive medical research and
education programs. However, some of our hospitals are affiliated with medical schools and may participate in the clinical rotation of medical interns and residents and other education programs.

At December 31, 2011, we operated five psychiatric hospitals with 506 licensed beds. Our psychiatric hospitals
provide therapeutic programs including child, adolescent and adult psychiatric care, adult and adolescent alcohol and drug abuse treatment and counseling.

We also operate outpatient health care facilities which include freestanding ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), freestanding emergency care facilities, diagnostic and imaging centers,
comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation and physical therapy centers, outpatient radiation and oncology therapy centers and various other facilities. These outpatient services are an integral component of our strategy to develop comprehensive health
care networks in select communities. Most of our ASCs are operated through partnerships or limited liability companies, with majority ownership of each partnership or limited liability company typically held by a general partner or subsidiary that
is an affiliate of HCA.

Certain of our affiliates provide a variety of management services to our health care
facilities, including patient safety programs; ethics and compliance programs; national supply contracts; equipment purchasing and leasing contracts; accounting, financial and clinical systems; governmental reimbursement assistance; construction
planning and coordination; information technology systems and solutions; legal counsel; human resources services; and internal audit services.

Sources of Revenue

Hospital revenues depend upon inpatient occupancy levels, the medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges or payment
rates for such services. Charges and reimbursement rates for inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of payer, the type of service (e.g., medical/surgical, intensive care or psychiatric) and the geographic location of the
hospital. Inpatient occupancy levels fluctuate for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control.







We receive payments for patient services from the federal government under
the Medicare program, state governments under their respective Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans, private insurers and directly from patients. Our revenues from third-party payers and the uninsured for the years ended
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

Medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance
benefits to persons age 65 and over, some disabled persons, persons with end-stage renal disease and persons with Lou Gehrig’s Disease. Medicaid is a federal-state program, administered by the states, which provides hospital and medical
benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford health care. All of our general, acute care hospitals located in the United States are certified as health care services providers for persons covered under Medicare and Medicaid programs.
Amounts received under Medicare and Medicaid programs are generally significantly less than established hospital gross charges for the services provided.

Our hospitals generally offer discounts from established charges to certain group purchasers of health care services, including private insurance companies, employers, health maintenance organizations
(“HMOs”), preferred provider organizations (“PPOs”) and other managed care plans. These discount programs generally limit our ability to increase revenues in response to increasing costs. See Item 1,
“Business — Competition.” Patients are generally not responsible for the total difference between established hospital gross charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under Medicare, Medicaid, HMOs, PPOs and other managed
care plans, but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions, deductibles or coinsurance features of their coverage. The amount of such exclusions, deductibles and coinsurance continues to increase. Collection of amounts due from individuals is
typically more difficult than from governmental or third-party payers. We provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care under our charity care policy. These discounts are similar to those provided to many
local managed care plans. In implementing the discount policy, we attempt to qualify uninsured patients for Medicaid, other federal or state assistance or charity care under our charity care policy. If an uninsured patient does not qualify for these
programs, the uninsured discount is applied.

Medicare

Inpatient Acute Care

Under the Medicare program, we receive reimbursement under a prospective payment system (“PPS”) for general,
acute care hospital inpatient services. Under the hospital inpatient PPS, fixed payment amounts per inpatient discharge are established based on the patient’s assigned Medicare severity diagnosis-related group







(“MS-DRG”). MS-DRGs classify treatments for illnesses according to the estimated intensity of hospital resources necessary to furnish care for each principal diagnosis. MS-DRG weights
represent the average resources for a given MS-DRG relative to the average resources for all MS-DRGs. MS-DRG payments are adjusted for area wage differentials. Hospitals, other than those defined as “new,” receive PPS reimbursement for
inpatient capital costs based on MS-DRG weights multiplied by a geographically adjusted federal rate. When the cost to treat certain patients falls well outside the normal distribution, providers typically receive additional “outlier”
payments.

CMS increased the MS-DRG rate for federal fiscal year 2011 by 2.35%, representing the full market basket of 2.6% minus
the 0.25% reduction required by the Health Reform Law. CMS also applied a documentation and coding adjustment of negative 2.9% in federal fiscal year 2011 to account for increases in aggregate payments during implementation of the MS-DRG system,
which resulted in an aggregate adjustment of negative 0.55% in federal fiscal year 2011. For federal fiscal year 2012, CMS issued a final rule that results in a net increase of 1.0%. This increase reflects the 2.9% market basket increase, a
prospective documentation and coding adjustment of negative 2.0%, a productivity adjustment of negative 1.0%, and a 1.1% increase in light of a January 2011 court decision. In addition, CMS intends to make an additional negative 1.9% documentation
and coding adjustment in the future, but has not specified when the adjustment will be made.

Further
realignments in the MS-DRG system could also reduce the payments we receive for certain specialties, including cardiology and orthopedics. CMS has focused on payment levels for such specialties in recent years in part because of the proliferation of
specialty hospitals. Changes in the payments received for specialty services could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.

The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) provides for hospitals to receive a 2% reduction to their market basket updates if they fail to submit data for
patient care quality indicators to the Secretary of HHS. As required by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (“DRA 2005”), CMS has expanded, through a series of rulemakings, the number of quality measures that must be reported to avoid the
market basket reduction. In federal fiscal year 2012, CMS requires hospitals to report 55 quality measures in order to avoid the market basket reduction for inpatient PPS payments in federal fiscal year 2013. All of our hospitals paid under the
Medicare inpatient PPS are participating in the quality initiative by submitting the requested quality data. While we will endeavor to comply with all data submission requirements as additional requirements continue to be added, our submissions may
not be deemed timely or sufficient to entitle us to the full market basket adjustment for all of our hospitals.

As part of CMS’ goal of transforming Medicare from a passive payer to an active purchaser of quality goods and
services, Medicare does not allow an inpatient hospital discharge to be assigned to a higher paying MS-DRG







if a selected hospital acquired condition (“HAC”) was not present on admission. In this situation, the case is paid as though the secondary diagnosis was not present. Currently, there
are ten categories of conditions on the list of HACs. In addition, CMS has established three National Coverage Determinations that prohibit Medicare reimbursement for erroneous surgical procedures performed on an inpatient or outpatient basis. The
Health Reform Law provides for reduced payments based on a hospital’s HAC rates. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous year will receive a 1% reduction in
their total inpatient operating Medicare payments. In addition, effective July 1, 2011, the Health Reform Law prohibits the use of federal funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to treat HACs.

The Health Reform Law also provides for reduced payments to hospitals based on readmission rates. Beginning
in federal fiscal year 2013, inpatient payments will be reduced if a hospital experiences “excessive” readmissions within the 30-day time period from the date of discharge for heart attack, heart failure, pneumonia or other conditions that
may be designated by CMS. Hospitals with what CMS defines as excessive readmissions for these conditions will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission
standard. Each hospital’s performance will be publicly reported by CMS. On August 1, 2011, CMS issued a final rule implementing portions of this program but indicated that it will issue in future rulemakings additional policies with respect to
excessive readmissions, including the specific payment adjustment methodology.

Historically, the Medicare program has set aside 5.10% of Medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases. For federal fiscal year 2011, CMS established an outlier threshold of $23,075, and for
federal fiscal year 2012, CMS reduced the outlier threshold to $22,385. We do not anticipate that the decrease to the outlier threshold for federal fiscal year 2012 will have a material impact on our results of operations.

Outpatient

CMS reimburses hospital outpatient services (and certain Medicare Part B services furnished to hospital inpatients who have no Part A coverage) on a PPS basis. CMS uses fee schedules to pay for
physical, occupational and speech therapies, durable medical equipment, clinical diagnostic laboratory services and nonimplantable orthotics and prosthetics, freestanding surgery center services and services provided by independent diagnostic
testing facilities.







Rehabilitation

In order to qualify for classification as an IRF, at least 60% of a facility’s inpatients during the most recent
12-month CMS-defined review period must have required intensive rehabilitation services for one or more of 13 specified conditions. IRFs must also meet additional coverage criteria, including patient selection and care requirements relating to
pre-admission screenings, post-admission evaluations, ongoing coordination of care and involvement of rehabilitation physicians. A facility that fails to meet the 60% threshold or other criteria to be classified as an IRF will be paid under the
acute care hospital inpatient or outpatient PPS, which generally provide for lower payment amounts. As of December 31, 2011, we had one rehabilitation hospital and 42 hospital rehabilitation units.







Psychiatric

Ambulatory Surgery Centers







Physician Services

Physician services are reimbursed under the physician fee schedule (“PFS”) system, under which CMS has assigned
a national relative value unit (“RVU”) to most medical procedures and services that reflects the various resources required by a physician to provide the services relative to all other services. Each RVU is calculated based on a
combination of work required in terms of time and intensity of effort for the service, practice expense (overhead) attributable to the service and malpractice insurance expense attributable to the service. These three elements are each modified by a
geographic adjustment factor to account for local practice costs and are then aggregated. The aggregated amount is multiplied by a conversion factor that accounts for inflation and targeted growth in Medicare expenditures (as calculated by the
sustainable growth rate (“SGR”)) to arrive at the payment amount for each service. While RVUs for various services may change in a given year, any alterations are required by statute to be virtually budget neutral, such that total payments
made under the PFS may not differ by more than $20 million from what payments would have been if adjustments were not made.

The PFS rates are adjusted each year, and reductions in both current and future payments are anticipated. The SGR formula, if implemented as mandated by statute, would result in significant reductions to
payments under the PFS. Since 2003, the U.S. Congress has passed multiple legislative acts delaying application of the SGR to the PFS. The most recent legislative delay extends calendar year 2011 payment rates through December 31, 2012. We
cannot predict whether the U.S. Congress will intervene to prevent this reduction to payments in the future. Barring delay or repeal of the SGR by Congress, Medicare payments to physicians are scheduled to be cut by more than 30% effective
January 1, 2013.

Other

Under PPS, the payment rates are adjusted for the area differences in wage levels by a factor (“wage index”)
reflecting the relative wage level in the geographic area compared to the national average wage level. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2007, CMS adjusted 100% of the wage index factor for occupational mix. The redistributive impact of wage index
changes, while slightly negative in the aggregate, is not anticipated to have a material financial impact for 2012. However, the Health Reform Law requires HHS to provide Congress with recommendations on how to comprehensively reform the Medicare
wage index system.

Medicare reimburses hospitals for a portion of bad debts resulting from deductible and
coinsurance amounts that are uncollectible from Medicare beneficiaries. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Jobs Creation Act of 2012 (the “Jobs Creation Act”) reduces the percentage of bad debt amounts that Medicare reimburses from 70% to 65%
beginning in federal fiscal year 2013. These reductions are intended to offset, in part, the impact of the most recent legislative delay of the SGR reductions in physician compensation under the PFS. The U.S. Congress has not permanently addressed
the SGR reductions, and any further delays or revisions to the SGR may be offset by additional reductions in Medicare payments to other types of providers.

As required by the MMA, CMS is implementing contractor reform whereby CMS has competitively bid the Medicare fiscal intermediary and Medicare carrier functions to 15 Medicare Administrative Contractors
(“MACs”), which are geographically assigned and service both Part A and Part B providers within a given jurisdiction. Although CMS has awarded initial contracts to all 15 MAC jurisdictions, full transition to the MAC
jurisdictions has been delayed due to CMS resoliciting some bids and implementing other corrective actions in response to filed protests. While chain providers had the option of having all hospitals use one home office MAC, HCA chose to use the MACs
assigned to the geographic areas in which our hospitals are located. The individual MAC jurisdictions are in varying phases of transition. During the transition periods and for a potentially unforeseen period thereafter, all of these changes could
impact claims processing functions and the resulting cash flow; however, we are unable to predict the impact at this time.

Under the Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”) program, CMS contracts with RACs on a contingency basis to conduct post-payment reviews to detect and correct improper payments in the fee-for-service
Medicare program. CMS has implemented the RAC program on a permanent, nationwide basis as required by statute.







Managed Medicare

Medicaid

Medicaid programs are funded jointly by the federal government and the states and are administered by states under
approved plans. Most state Medicaid program payments are made under a PPS or are based on negotiated payment levels with individual hospitals. Medicaid reimbursement is often less than a hospital’s cost of services. The Health Reform Law
requires states to expand Medicaid coverage to all individuals under age 65 with incomes up to 133% of the federal poverty level (“FPL”) by 2014. However, the Health Reform Law also requires states to apply a “5% income
disregard” to the Medicaid eligibility standard, so that Medicaid eligibility will effectively be extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. In addition, effective July 1, 2011, the Health Reform Law prohibits the use of federal
funds under the Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical assistance provided to treat HACs. However, CMS has delayed enforcement of this prohibition until July 1, 2012. In a final rule issued June 1, 2011, CMS authorizes states to add
additional provider-preventable conditions to the list of HACs for which Medicaid reimbursement will not be allowed.

Since most states must operate with balanced budgets and since the Medicaid program is often the state’s largest program, states can be expected to adopt or consider adopting legislation designed to
reduce their Medicaid expenditures. The current economic downturn has increased the budgetary pressures on most states, and these budgetary pressures have resulted and likely will continue to result in decreased spending, or decreased spending
growth, for Medicaid programs in many states. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (“ARRA”) allocated approximately $87.0 billion to temporarily increase the share of program costs paid by the federal government to fund
each state’s Medicaid program. Although initially scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, Congress allocated additional funds to extend this increased federal funding to states through June 2011. Although these increased funds provided a
benefit to state Medicaid programs by temporarily helping to avoid more extensive program and reimbursement cuts, the expiration of the increased federal funding could result in significant reductions to state Medicaid programs.

Certain states in which we operate have adopted broad-based provider taxes to fund the non-federal share of Medicaid
programs. Many states have also adopted, or are considering, legislation designed to reduce coverage, enroll Medicaid recipients in managed care programs and/or impose additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand the states’ Medicaid
systems. Effective March 23, 2010, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for adults until January 1, 2014 and for children until
October 1, 2019. However, states with budget deficits may seek a waiver from this requirement to address eligibility standards that apply to adults making more than 133% of the FPL.







Through DRA 2005, Congress has expanded the federal government’s
involvement in fighting fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program by creating the Medicaid Integrity Program. Among other things, DRA 2005 requires CMS to employ private contractors, referred to as Medicaid Integrity Contractors
(“MICs”), to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. MICs are assigned to five geographic regions and have commenced audits in states assigned to those regions. The Health Reform Law increases federal
funding for the MIC program for federal fiscal year 2011 and later years. In addition to MICs, several other contractors and state Medicaid agencies have increased their review activities. The Health Reform Law expands the RAC program’s scope
to include Medicaid claims.

Managed Medicaid

Managed Medicaid programs enable states to contract with one or more entities for patient enrollment, care management and
claims adjudication. The states usually do not relinquish program responsibilities for financing, eligibility criteria and core benefit plan design. We generally contract directly with one of the designated entities, usually a managed care
organization. The provisions of these programs are state-specific.

Enrollment in managed Medicaid plans has
increased in recent years, as state governments seek to control the cost of Medicaid programs. However, general economic conditions in the states in which we operate may require reductions in premium payments to these plans and may reduce enrollment
in these plans.

Accountable Care Organizations and Bundled Payment Initiatives

The Health Reform Law created the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation with responsibility for establishing
demonstration projects and other initiatives in order to identify, develop, test and encourage the adoption of new methods of delivering and paying for healthcare that create savings under the Medicare and Medicaid programs while improving quality
of care. For example, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation has announced a voluntary bundled payment initiative that will link payments to participating providers for services provided during an episode of care. In addition, the Health
Reform Law requires HHS to establish a five-year, voluntary national bundled payment pilot program for Medicare services beginning no later than January 1, 2013. Under the program, providers would agree to receive one payment for services
provided to Medicare patients for certain medical conditions or episodes of care. In addition, the Health Reform Law provides for a five-year bundled payment pilot program for Medicaid services. HHS may select up to eight states to participate, and
these state programs may target particular categories of beneficiaries, selected diagnoses or geographic regions of the state. The selected state programs will provide one payment for both hospital and physician services provided to Medicaid
patients for certain episodes of inpatient care.









Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments

In addition to making payments for services provided directly to beneficiaries, Medicare makes additional payments to
hospitals that treat a disproportionately large number of low-income patients (Medicaid and Medicare patients eligible to receive Supplemental Security Income). Disproportionate share hospital (“DSH”) payments are determined annually based
on certain statistical information required by HHS and are calculated as a percentage addition to MS-DRG payments.

Under the Health Reform Law, beginning in federal fiscal year 2014, Medicare DSH payments will be reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the
amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH will be effectively pooled, and this pool will be reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age. Each DSH
hospital will then be paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its level of uncompensated care. It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Medicare DSH reductions. The CBO estimates $22 billion in
reductions to Medicare DSH payments between 2010 and 2019, while for the same time period, CMS estimates reimbursement reductions totaling $50 billion.

Hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based
on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. States have broad discretion to define which hospitals qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law will
reduce funding for the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal years 2014 through 2020 by the following amounts: 2014 ($500 million); 2015 ($600 million); 2016 ($600 million); 2017 ($1.8 billion); 2018 ($5 billion);
2019 ($5.6 billion); and 2020 ($4 billion). In addition, the Jobs Creation Act provides for an additional Medicaid DSH reduction of $4.1 billion in federal fiscal year 2021. How such cuts are allocated among the states and how the states
allocate these cuts among providers, have yet to be determined.

TRICARE

TRICARE is the Department of Defense’s health care program for members of the armed forces. For inpatient services,
TRICARE reimburses hospitals based on a DRG system modeled on the Medicare inpatient PPS. The Department of Defense has also implemented a PPS for hospital outpatient services furnished to TRICARE beneficiaries similar to that utilized for services
furnished to Medicare beneficiaries. Because the Medicare outpatient PPS APC rates have historically been below TRICARE rates, the adoption of this payment methodology for TRICARE beneficiaries has reduced our reimbursement; however, TRICARE
outpatient services do not represent a significant portion of our patient volumes.

Annual Cost Reports

All hospitals participating in the Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or
under a PPS, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenues, costs and expenses associated with the services
provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients.

Annual cost reports required
under the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to routine audits, which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to us under these reimbursement programs. These audits often require several years to reach the
final determination of amounts due to or from us under these programs. Providers also have rights of appeal, and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of cost reports.







Managed Care and Other Discounted Plans

Most of our hospitals offer discounts from established charges to certain large group purchasers of health care services,
including managed care plans and private insurance companies. Admissions reimbursed by commercial managed care and other insurers were 31%, 32%, and 34% of our total admissions for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
Managed care contracts are typically negotiated for terms between one and three years. While we generally received contracted annual average increases that were expected to yield 5% to 6% from managed care payers during 2011, there can be no
assurance that we will continue to receive increases in the future. It is not clear what impact, if any, the increased obligations on managed care payers and other health plans imposed by the Health Reform Law will have on our ability to negotiate
reimbursement increases.

Uninsured and Self-Pay Patients

Electronic Health Record Incentives

ARRA provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments beginning in federal fiscal year 2011 for eligible hospitals and calendar year 2011 for eligible professionals that adopt and meaningfully use
certified electronic health record (“EHR”) technology. A total of at least $20 billion in incentives is being made available through the Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive programs to eligible hospitals and eligible professionals in the
adoption of EHRs.

Under the Medicare incentive program, eligible hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use
will receive incentive payments for up to four fiscal years. The Medicare incentive payment amount is the product of three factors: (1) an initial amount comprised of a base amount of $2,000,000, plus $200 for each acute care inpatient
discharge, beginning with a hospital’s 1,150th discharge of the applicable year and ending with a hospital’s 23,000th discharge of the applicable year; (2) the “Medicare share,” which is the sum of Medicare Part A and Part C
acute care inpatient-bed-days divided by the product of the total acute care inpatient-bed-days and a charity care factor; and (3) a transition factor applicable to the payment year. In order to maximize their incentive payments, acute care
hospitals must participate in the incentive program by federal fiscal year 2013. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, acute care hospitals that fail to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology will receive reduced market basket
updates under inpatient PPS.







Eligible professionals who demonstrate meaningful use are entitled to
incentive payments for up to five payment years in an amount equal to 75% of their estimated Medicare allowed charges for covered professional services furnished during the relevant calendar year, subject to an annual limit. Eligible professionals
must participate in the incentive payment program by calendar year 2012 in order to maximize their incentive payments and must participate by calendar year 2014 in order to receive any incentive payments. Beginning in calendar year 2015, eligible
professionals who do not demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology will face Medicare payment reductions.

The Medicaid EHR incentive program is voluntary for states to implement. For participating states, the Medicaid EHR incentive program will provide incentive payments for acute care hospitals and eligible
professionals that meet certain volume percentages of Medicaid patients, as well as children’s hospitals. Providers may only participate in a single state’s Medicaid EHR incentive program. Eligible professionals can only participate in
either the Medicaid incentive program or the Medicare incentive program and can change this election only one time. Eligible hospitals may participate in both the Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs.

To qualify for incentive payments under the Medicaid program, providers must either adopt, implement, upgrade or
demonstrate meaningful use of, certified EHR technology during their first participation year or successfully demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology in subsequent participation years. Payments may be received for up to six
participation years. For hospitals, the aggregate Medicaid EHR incentive amount is the product of two factors: (1) the overall EHR amount which is comprised of a base amount of $2,000,000 plus a discharge-related amount, multiplied by the
Medicare share (which is set at one by statute) multiplied by a transition factor, and (2) the “Medicaid share,” which is the estimated Medicaid inpatient-bed days plus estimated Medicaid managed care inpatient bed-days, divided by
the product of the estimated total inpatient bed-days and a charity care factor. Under the Medicaid incentive program, eligible professionals may receive payments based on their EHR costs, up to total amount of $63,750, or for pediatricians,
$42,500. There is no penalty for hospitals or professionals under Medicaid for failing to meet EHR meaningful use requirements.

Hospital
Utilization

We believe the most important factors relating to the overall utilization of a hospital are
the quality and market position of the hospital and the number and quality of physicians and other health care professionals providing patient care within the facility. Generally, we believe the ability of a hospital to be a market leader is
determined by its breadth of services, level of technology, quality and condition of the facilities, emphasis on quality of care and convenience for patients and physicians. Other factors that impact utilization include the growth in local
population, local economic conditions and market penetration of managed care programs.







The following table sets forth certain operating statistics for our health
care facilities. Health care facility operations are subject to certain seasonal fluctuations, including decreases in patient utilization during holiday periods and increases in the cold weather months. The data set forth in this table includes only
those facilities that are consolidated for financial reporting purposes.

Competition

Generally, other hospitals in the local communities served by most of our hospitals provide services similar to those offered by our hospitals. Additionally, in recent years the number of freestanding
ASCs and diagnostic centers (including facilities owned by physicians) in the geographic areas in which we operate has increased significantly. As a result, most of our hospitals operate in a highly competitive environment. In some cases, competing
hospitals are more established than our hospitals. Some competing hospitals are owned by tax-supported government agencies and many others are owned by not-for-profit entities that may be supported by endowments, charitable contributions and/or tax
revenues and are exempt from sales, property and income taxes. Such exemptions and support are not available to our hospitals and may provide the tax supported or not-for-profit entities an advantage in funding capital expenditures. In certain
localities there are large teaching hospitals that provide highly specialized facilities, equipment and services which may not be available at most of our hospitals. We also face competition from specialty hospitals, some of which are
physician-owned, and from both our own and unaffiliated freestanding ASCs for market share in certain high margin services.

Psychiatric hospitals frequently attract patients from areas outside their immediate locale and, therefore, our psychiatric hospitals compete with both local and regional hospitals, including the
psychiatric units of general, acute care hospitals.

Our strategies are designed to ensure our hospitals are
competitive. We believe our hospitals compete within local communities on the basis of many factors, including the quality of care, ability to attract and retain quality physicians, skilled clinical personnel and other health care professionals,
location, breadth of services, technology offered, quality and condition of the facilities and prices charged. The Health Reform Law requires hospitals to publish annually a list of their standard charges for items and services. We have increased
our focus on operating outpatient services with improved accessibility and more convenient service for patients, and increased predictability and efficiency for physicians.

Two of the most significant factors to the competitive position of a hospital are the number and quality of physicians
affiliated with or employed by the hospital. Although physicians may at any time terminate their relationship with a hospital we operate, our hospitals seek to retain physicians with varied specialties on the hospitals’ medical staffs and to
attract other qualified physicians. We believe physicians refer patients to a hospital on the basis of the quality and scope of services it renders to patients and physicians, the quality of physicians on the medical staff, the location of the
hospital and the quality of the hospital’s facilities, equipment and employees. Accordingly, we strive to maintain and provide quality facilities, equipment, employees and services for physicians and patients.







importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from community to community, depending on the market strength of such organizations.

State certificate of need (“CON”) laws, which place limitations on a hospital’s ability to expand hospital
services and facilities, make capital expenditures and otherwise make changes in operations, may also have the effect of restricting competition. We currently operate health care facilities in a number of states with CON laws. Before issuing a CON,
these states consider the need for additional or expanded health care facilities or services. In those states which have no CON laws or which set relatively high levels of expenditures before they become reviewable by state authorities, competition
in the form of new services, facilities and capital spending is more prevalent. See Item 1, “Business — Regulation and Other Factors.”

We and the health care industry as a whole face the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while dealing with rising costs and strong competition for patients. Changes in medical
technology, existing and future legislation, regulations and interpretations and managed care contracting for provider services by private and government payers remain ongoing challenges.

Admissions, average lengths of stay and reimbursement amounts continue to be negatively affected by payer-required
pre-admission authorization, utilization review and payer pressure to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. The Health Reform Law potentially expands the use of prepayment review by Medicare
contractors by eliminating statutory restrictions on their use. Increased competition, admission constraints and payer pressures are expected to continue. To meet these challenges, we intend to expand and update our facilities or acquire or
construct new facilities where appropriate, to enhance the provision of a comprehensive array of outpatient services, offer market competitive pricing to private payer groups, upgrade facilities and equipment and offer new or expanded programs and
services.

Regulation and Other Factors

Licensure, Certification and Accreditation

Certificates of Need

In some states where we operate hospitals and other health care facilities, the construction or expansion of health care facilities, the acquisition of existing facilities, the transfer or change of
ownership and the addition of







new beds or services may be subject to review by and prior approval of, or notifications to, state regulatory agencies under a CON program. Such laws generally require the reviewing state agency
to determine the public need for additional or expanded health care facilities and services. Failure to provide required notifications or obtain necessary state approvals can result in the inability to expand facilities, complete an acquisition or
change ownership or other penalties.

State Rate Review

Some states have adopted legislation mandating rate or budget review for hospitals or have adopted taxes on hospital
revenues, assessments or licensure fees to fund indigent health care within the state. In the aggregate, indigent tax provisions have not materially, adversely affected our results of operations. Although we do not currently operate facilities in
states that mandate rate or budget reviews, we cannot predict whether we will operate in such states in the future, or whether the states in which we currently operate may adopt legislation mandating such reviews.

Federal Health Care Program Regulations

Participation in any federal health care program, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, is heavily regulated by statute and regulation. If a hospital fails to substantially comply with the
numerous conditions of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs or performs certain prohibited acts, the hospital’s participation in the federal health care programs may be terminated, or civil and/or criminal penalties may be
imposed.

Anti-kickback Statute

A section of the Social Security Act known as the “Anti-kickback Statute” prohibits providers and others from
directly or indirectly soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration with the intent of generating referrals or orders for services or items covered by a federal health care program. Courts have interpreted this statute broadly and held
that there is a violation of the Anti-kickback Statute if just one purpose of the remuneration is to generate referrals, even if there are other lawful purposes. Furthermore, the Health Reform Law provides that knowledge of the law or the intent to
violate the law is not required. Violations of the Anti-kickback Statute may be punished by a criminal fine of up to $25,000 for each violation or imprisonment, civil money penalties of up to $50,000 per violation and damages of up to three times
the total amount of the remuneration and/or exclusion from participation in federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. The Health Reform Law provides that submission of a claim for services or items generated in violation of the
Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim and may be subject to additional penalties under the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”).







excess of their fair market value, and (k) rental of space in physician offices, at other than fair market value terms, by persons or entities to which physicians refer. The OIG has
encouraged persons having information about hospitals who offer the above types of incentives to physicians to report such information to the OIG.

The OIG also issues Special Advisory Bulletins as a means of providing guidance to health care providers. These bulletins, along with the Special Fraud Alerts, have focused on certain arrangements that
could be subject to heightened scrutiny by government enforcement authorities, including: (a) contractual joint venture arrangements and other joint venture arrangements between those in a position to refer business, such as physicians, and
those providing items or services for which Medicare or Medicaid pays, and (b) certain “gainsharing” arrangements, i.e., the practice of giving physicians a share of any reduction in a hospital’s costs for patient care
attributable in part to the physician’s efforts.

In addition to issuing Special Fraud Alerts and Special
Advisory Bulletins, the OIG issues compliance program guidance for certain types of health care providers. The OIG guidance identifies a number of risk areas under federal fraud and abuse statutes and regulations. These areas of risk include
compensation arrangements with physicians, recruitment arrangements with physicians and joint venture relationships with physicians.

As authorized by Congress, the OIG has published safe harbor regulations that outline categories of activities deemed protected from prosecution under the Anti-kickback Statute. Currently, there are
statutory exceptions and safe harbors for various activities, including the following: certain investment interests, space rental, equipment rental, practitioner recruitment, personnel services and management contracts, sale of practice, referral
services, warranties, discounts, employees, group purchasing organizations, waiver of beneficiary coinsurance and deductible amounts, managed care arrangements, obstetrical malpractice insurance subsidies, investments in group practices,
freestanding surgery centers, ambulance replenishing, and referral agreements for specialty services.

The
fact that conduct or a business arrangement does not fall within a safe harbor, or it is identified in a Special Fraud Alert, Special Advisory Bulletin or other guidance or as a risk area in the Supplemental Compliance Guidelines for Hospitals, does
not necessarily render the conduct or business arrangement illegal under the Anti-kickback Statute. However, such conduct and business arrangements may lead to increased scrutiny by government enforcement authorities.

We have a variety of financial relationships with physicians and others who either refer or influence the referral of
patients to our hospitals and other health care facilities, including employment contracts, leases, medical director agreements and professional service agreements. We also have similar relationships with physicians and facilities to which patients
are referred from our facilities. In addition, we provide financial incentives, including minimum revenue guarantees, to recruit physicians into the communities served by our hospitals. While we endeavor to comply with the applicable safe harbors,
certain of our current arrangements, including joint ventures and financial relationships with physicians and other referral sources and persons and entities to which we refer patients, do not qualify for safe harbor protection.

Although we believe our arrangements with physicians and other referral sources have been structured to comply with
current law and available interpretations, there can be no assurance regulatory authorities enforcing these laws will determine these financial arrangements comply with the Anti-kickback Statute or other applicable laws. An adverse determination
could subject us to liabilities under the Social Security Act and other laws, including criminal penalties, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid or other federal health care programs.

Stark Law

The Social Security Act also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law.” The Stark Law prohibits physicians from referring Medicare and Medicaid patients to entities with which they
or any of their







Through a series of rulemakings, CMS has issued final regulations
implementing the Stark Law. Additional changes to these regulations, which became effective October 1, 2009, further restrict the types of arrangements facilities and physicians may enter, including additional restrictions on certain leases,
percentage compensation arrangements, and agreements under which a hospital purchases services “under arrangements.” While these regulations were intended to clarify the requirements of the exceptions to the Stark Law, it is unclear how
the government will interpret many of these exceptions for enforcement purposes. Further, we do not always have the benefit of significant regulatory or judicial interpretation of the Stark Law and its implementing regulations. We attempt to
structure our relationships to meet an exception to the Stark Law, but the regulations implementing the exceptions are detailed and complex, and we cannot assure that every relationship complies fully with the Stark Law.

Similar State Laws

Many states in which we operate also have laws similar to the Anti-kickback Statute that prohibit payments to physicians for patient referrals and laws similar to the Stark Law that prohibit certain
self-referrals. The scope of these state laws is broad, since they can often apply regardless of the source of payment for care, and little precedent exists for their interpretation or enforcement. These statutes typically provide for criminal and
civil penalties, as well as loss of facility licensure.

Other Fraud and Abuse Provisions

HIPAA broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws by adding several criminal provisions for health care fraud
offenses that apply to all health benefit programs. The Social Security Act also imposes criminal and civil penalties for making false claims and statements to Medicare and Medicaid. False claims include, but are not limited to, billing for services
not rendered or for misrepresenting actual services rendered in order to obtain higher reimbursement, billing for unnecessary goods and services and cost report fraud. Federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and
Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed health care fraud, even if the officer or managing employee had no knowledge of the fraud. Criminal and civil penalties may be imposed for
a number of other prohibited activities, including failure to return known overpayments, certain gainsharing arrangements, billing Medicare amounts that are substantially in excess of a provider’s usual charges, offering remuneration to
influence a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary’s selection of a health care provider, contracting with an individual or entity known to be excluded from a federal health care program, making or accepting a payment to induce a physician to reduce
or limit services, and soliciting or receiving any remuneration in return for referring an







individual for an item or service payable by a federal health care program. Like the Anti-kickback Statute, these provisions are very broad. Under the Health Reform Law, civil penalties may be
imposed for the failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of identifying the overpayment or by the date a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. To avoid liability, providers must, among other things, carefully
and accurately code claims for reimbursement, promptly return overpayments and accurately prepare cost reports.

Some of these provisions, including the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law, require a lower burden of proof than other
fraud and abuse laws, including the Anti-kickback Statute. Civil monetary penalties that may be imposed under the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law range from $10,000 to $50,000 per act, and in some cases may result in penalties of up to three
times the remuneration offered, paid, solicited or received. In addition, a violator may be subject to exclusion from federal and state health care programs. Federal and state governments increasingly use the federal Civil Monetary Penalty Law,
especially where they believe they cannot meet the higher burden of proof requirements under the Anti-kickback Statute. Further, individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of
at least $100 of Medicare funds under the Medicare Integrity Program.

The Federal False Claims Act and Similar State Laws

qui tam

qui tam

In some cases, whistleblowers and the federal government have taken the position, and some courts have held, that
providers who allegedly have violated other statutes, such as the Anti-kickback Statute and the Stark Law, have thereby submitted false claims under the FCA. The Health Reform Law clarifies this issue with respect to the Anti-kickback Statute by
providing that submission of claims for services or items generated in violation of the Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim under the FCA. Every entity that receives at least $5 million annually in Medicaid payments
must have written policies for all employees, contractors or agents, providing detailed information about false claims, false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws, including the FCA, and similar state laws. In
addition, federal law provides an incentive to states to enact false claims laws comparable to the FCA. A number of states in which we operate have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions under which a
private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court. We have adopted and distributed policies pertaining to the FCA and relevant state laws.







HIPAA Administrative Simplification and Privacy and Security Requirements

The Administrative Simplification Provisions of HIPAA require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards
for certain health care claims and payment transactions submitted or received electronically. These provisions are intended to encourage electronic commerce in the health care industry. HHS has issued regulations implementing the HIPAA
Administrative Simplification Provisions and compliance with these regulations is mandatory for our facilities. The Health Reform Law requires HHS to adopt standards for additional electronic transactions and to establish operating rules to promote
uniformity in the implementation of each standardized electronic transaction. In addition, HIPAA requires that each provider use a National Provider Identifier. CMS has also published a final rule requiring the use of updated standard code sets for
certain diagnoses and procedures known as ICD-10 code sets. Implementing the ICD-10 code sets will require significant administrative changes. By regulation, use of the ICD-10 code sets is required beginning October 1, 2013, but CMS has announced
that it intends to extend this deadline.

The privacy and security regulations promulgated pursuant to HIPAA
extensively regulate the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information and require covered entities, including health plans and most health care providers, to implement administrative, physical and technical safeguards to
protect the security of such information. ARRA broadened the scope of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. In addition, ARRA extends the application of certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations to business associates
(entities that handle identifiable health information on behalf of covered entities) and subjects business associates to civil and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations. On July 14, 2010, HHS issued a proposed rule that would
implement many of these ARRA provisions. If finalized, these changes would likely require amendments to existing agreements with business associates and would subject business associates and their subcontractors to direct liability under the HIPAA
privacy and security regulations. We currently enforce a HIPAA compliance plan, which we believe complies with HIPAA privacy and security requirements and under which a HIPAA compliance group monitors our compliance. The privacy regulations and
security regulations have and will continue to impose significant costs on our facilities in order to comply with these standards.

As required by ARRA, HHS published an interim final rule on August 24, 2009, that requires covered entities to report breaches of unsecured protected health information to affected individuals
without unreasonable delay but not to exceed 60 days of discovery of the breach by a covered entity or its agents. Notification must also be made to HHS and, in certain situations involving large breaches, to the media. HHS is required to
publish on its website a list of all covered entities that report a breach involving more than 500 individuals. Various state laws and regulations may also require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving
individually identifiable information.

Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in
civil and criminal penalties, and ARRA has strengthened the enforcement provisions of HIPAA, which may result in increased enforcement activity. As required by ARRA, HHS has announced a pilot program to perform audits of up to 150 covered entities
by the end of 2012. ARRA broadens the applicability of the criminal penalty provisions to employees of covered entities and requires HHS to impose penalties for violations resulting from willful neglect. ARRA also significantly increases the amount
of the civil penalties, with penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for a maximum civil penalty of $1,500,000 in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. In addition, ARRA authorizes state attorneys general to bring civil actions
seeking either injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations that threaten the privacy of state residents.

There are numerous other laws and legislative and regulatory initiatives at the federal and state levels addressing privacy and security concerns. Our facilities remain subject to any federal or state
privacy-related laws that are more restrictive than the privacy regulations issued under HIPAA. These laws vary and could impose additional penalties.







EMTALA

All of our hospitals in the United States are subject to EMTALA. This federal law requires any hospital participating in
the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every individual who presents to the hospital’s emergency room for treatment and, if the individual is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either
stabilize the condition or make an appropriate transfer of the individual to a facility able to handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions exists regardless of an individual’s ability to pay for
treatment. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer an individual or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the individual’s ability to
pay. Penalties for violations of EMTALA include civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare program. In addition, an injured individual, the individual’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss
as a direct result of a hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against the hospital.

The
government broadly interprets EMTALA to cover situations in which individuals do not actually present to a hospital’s emergency room, but present for emergency examination or treatment to the hospital’s campus, generally, or to a
hospital-based clinic that treats emergency medical conditions or are transported in a hospital-owned ambulance, subject to certain exceptions. At least one court has interpreted the law also to apply to a hospital that has been notified of a
patient’s pending arrival in a non-hospital owned ambulance. EMTALA does not generally apply to individuals admitted for inpatient services. The government has expressed its intent to investigate and enforce EMTALA violations actively in the
future. We believe our hospitals operate in substantial compliance with EMTALA.

Corporate Practice of Medicine/Fee
Splitting

Some of the states in which we operate have laws prohibiting corporations and other entities
from employing physicians, practicing medicine for a profit and making certain direct and indirect payments or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to, or the
recommendation of, particular providers for medical products and services. Possible sanctions for violation of these restrictions include loss of license and civil and criminal penalties. In addition, agreements between the corporation and the
physician may be considered void and unenforceable. These statutes vary from state to state, are often vague and have seldom been interpreted by the courts or regulatory agencies.

Health Care Industry Investigations

Significant media and public attention has focused in recent years on the hospital industry. This media and public attention, changes in government personnel or other factors may lead to increased
scrutiny of the health care industry. Except as may be disclosed in our SEC filings, we are not aware of any material investigations of the Company under federal or state health care laws or regulations. It is possible that governmental entities
could initiate investigations or litigation in the future at facilities we operate and that such matters could result in significant penalties, as well as adverse publicity. It is also possible that our executives and managers could be included in
governmental investigations or litigation or named as defendants in private litigation.

Our substantial
Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental billings result in heightened scrutiny of our operations. We continue to monitor all aspects of our business and have developed a comprehensive ethics and compliance program that is designed to meet or
exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. Because the law in this area is complex and constantly evolving, governmental investigations or litigation may result in interpretations that are inconsistent with our or industry
practices.

In public statements surrounding current investigations, governmental authorities have taken
positions on a number of issues, including some for which little official interpretation previously has been available, that appear to be inconsistent with practices that have been common within the industry and that previously have not been
challenged in this manner. In some instances, government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law may now be conducted as criminal investigations.







Both federal and state government agencies have increased their focus on and
coordination of civil and criminal enforcement efforts in the health care area. The OIG and the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) have, from time to time, established national enforcement initiatives, targeting all hospital providers that
focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse. The Health Reform Law includes additional federal funding of $350 million over the next 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse, including
$105 million for federal fiscal year 2011 and $65 million in federal fiscal year 2012. In addition, governmental agencies and their agents, such as MACs, fiscal intermediaries and carriers, may conduct audits of our health care operations.
Private payers may conduct similar post-payment audits, and we also perform internal audits and monitoring.

In addition to national enforcement initiatives, federal and state investigations have addressed a wide variety of
routine health care operations such as: cost reporting and billing practices, including for Medicare outliers; financial arrangements with referral sources; physician recruitment activities; physician joint ventures; and hospital charges and
collection practices for self-pay patients. We engage in many of these routine health care operations and other activities that could be the subject of governmental investigations or inquiries. For example, we have significant Medicare and Medicaid
billings, numerous financial arrangements with physicians who are referral sources to our hospitals, and joint venture arrangements involving physician investors. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and other facilities may receive,
government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by, federal and state agencies. Any additional investigations of the Company, our executives or managers could result in significant liabilities or penalties to us, as well as adverse
publicity.

Health Care Reform

As enacted, the Health Reform Law will change how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program
spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments, and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. In addition, the law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie
Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. Numerous lawsuits have challenged the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law. Some federal courts have upheld
the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law or dismissed cases on procedural grounds. Others have held unconstitutional the requirement that individuals maintain health insurance or pay a penalty and have either found the Health Reform Law void
in its entirety or left the remainder of the law intact. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law in 2012. Based on the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court’s review, the Health Reform Law, or
individual components of it, may be upheld, invalidated or modified. In addition, repeal of the Health Reform Law has become a theme in political campaigns during this election year.

Expanded Coverage

Based on CBO and CMS estimates made prior to enactment of the Health Reform Law, by 2019, the Health Reform Law will expand coverage to 32 to 34 million additional individuals (resulting in coverage
of an estimated 94% of the legal U.S. population). This increased coverage will occur through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms.

Medicaid Expansion

The primary public program coverage expansion will occur through changes in Medicaid, and to a lesser extent, expansion of the Children’s Health Insurance Program (“CHIP”). The most
significant changes will expand the categories of individuals eligible for Medicaid coverage and permit individuals with relatively higher incomes to qualify. The federal government reimburses the majority of a state’s Medicaid expenses, and it
conditions its payment on the state meeting certain requirements. The federal government currently requires that states provide coverage for only limited categories of low-income adults under 65 years old (e.g., women who are pregnant, and the
blind or disabled). In addition, the income level required for individuals and families to qualify for Medicaid varies widely from state to state.







The Health Reform Law materially changes the requirements for Medicaid
eligibility. Commencing January 1, 2014, all state Medicaid programs are required to provide, and the federal government will subsidize, Medicaid coverage to virtually all adults under 65 years old with incomes at or under 133% of the
federal poverty level (“FPL”). This expansion will create a minimum Medicaid eligibility threshold that is uniform across states. Further, the Health Reform Law also requires states to apply a “5% income disregard” to the
Medicaid eligibility standard, so that Medicaid eligibility will effectively be extended to those with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. According to the CBO’s March 2011 projection, the new eligibility requirements will expand Medicaid and CHIP
coverage by an estimated 17 million persons nationwide. A disproportionately large percentage of the new Medicaid coverage is likely to be in states that currently have relatively low income eligibility requirements.

As Medicaid is a joint federal and state program, the federal government provides states with “matching funds”
in a defined percentage, known as the federal medical assistance percentage (“FMAP”). Beginning in 2014, states will receive an enhanced FMAP for the individuals enrolled in Medicaid pursuant to the Health Reform Law. The FMAP percentage
is as follows: 100% for calendar years 2014 through 2016; 95% for 2017; 94% in 2018; 93% in 2019; and 90% in 2020 and thereafter.

The Health Reform Law also provides that the federal government will subsidize states that create non-Medicaid plans for residents whose incomes are greater than 133% of the FPL but do not exceed 200% of
the FPL. Approved state plans will be eligible to receive federal funding. The amount of that funding per individual will be equal to 95% of subsidies that would have been provided for that individual had he or she enrolled in a health plan offered
through one of the Exchanges, as discussed below.

Historically, states often have attempted to reduce
Medicaid spending by limiting benefits and tightening Medicaid eligibility requirements. However, the Health Reform Law requires states to at least maintain Medicaid eligibility standards established prior to the enactment of the law for adults
until January 1, 2014 and for children until October 1, 2019. States with budget deficits may seek a waiver from this requirement, but only to address eligibility standards that apply to adults making more than 133% of the FPL.

Private Sector Expansion

The expansion of health coverage through the private sector as a result of the Health Reform Law will occur through new requirements applicable to health insurers, employers and individuals. Health
insurers must keep their annual nonmedical costs lower than 15% of premium revenue for the group market and lower than 20% in the small group and individual markets or rebate to enrollees the amount spent in excess of the percentage. In addition,
health insurers are not permitted to deny coverage to children based upon a pre-existing condition and must allow dependent care coverage for children up to 26 years old. Commencing January 1, 2014, health insurers will be prohibited from
imposing annual coverage limits, dropping coverage, excluding persons based upon pre-existing conditions or denying coverage for any individual who is willing to pay the premiums for such coverage.

Larger employers will be subject to new requirements and incentives to provide health insurance benefits to their full
time employees. Effective January 1, 2014, employers with 50 or more employees that do not offer health insurance will be held subject to a penalty if an employee obtains government-subsidized coverage through an Exchange. The employer
penalties will range from $2,000 to $3,000 per employee, subject to certain thresholds and conditions.

As
enacted, the Health Reform Law uses various means to induce individuals who do not have health insurance to obtain coverage. By January 1, 2014, individuals will be required to maintain health insurance for a minimum defined set of benefits or
pay a tax penalty. The penalty in most cases is $95 in 2014, $325 in 2015, $695 in 2016, and indexed to a cost of living adjustment in subsequent years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”), in consultation with HHS, is responsible for
enforcing the tax penalty, although the Health Reform Law







limits the availability of certain IRS enforcement mechanisms. In addition, for individuals and families below 400% of the FPL, the cost of obtaining health insurance through the Exchanges will
be subsidized by the federal government. Those with lower incomes will be eligible to receive greater subsidies. It is anticipated that those at the lowest income levels will have the majority of their premiums subsidized by the federal government,
in some cases in excess of 95% of the premium amount.

Public Program Spending

The Health Reform Law provides for Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care program spending reductions between
2010 and 2019. In March 2010, CMS estimated Medicare fee-for-service reductions from 2010 to 2019 would be $233 billion and the Medicare and Medicaid DSH reductions would be an additional $64 billion. In February 2011, the CBO estimated that from
2012 to 2021, the Health Reform Law reductions would include $379 billion in Medicare fee-for-service market basket and productivity reimbursement reductions, the majority of which will come from hospitals. The CBO estimate included an additional
$57 billion in reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH funding.

Payments for Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgery Centers

Inpatient Market Basket and Productivity Adjustment.    Under the
Medicare program, hospitals receive reimbursement under a PPS for general, acute care hospital inpatient services. CMS establishes fixed PPS payment amounts per inpatient discharge based on the patient’s assigned MS-DRG. These MS-DRG rates are
updated each federal fiscal year, which begins October 1, using a market basket index that takes into account inflation experienced by hospitals and other entities outside the health care industry in purchasing goods and services.

The Health Reform Law provides for three types of annual reductions in the market basket. The first is a general
reduction of a specified percentage each federal fiscal year starting in 2010 and extending through 2019. These reductions are as follows: federal fiscal year 2010, 0.25% for discharges occurring on or after April 1, 2010; 2011 (0.25%); 2012
(0.1%); 2013 (0.1%); 2014 (0.3%); 2015 (0.2%); 2016 (0.2%); 2017 (0.75%); 2018 (0.75%); and 2019 (0.75%).

The
second type of reduction to the market basket is a “productivity adjustment” that was implemented by HHS beginning in federal fiscal year 2012. The amount of that reduction is the projected nationwide productivity







gains over the preceding 10 years. To determine the projection, HHS uses the BLS 10-year moving average of changes in specified economy-wide productivity (the BLS data is typically a few
years old). The Health Reform Law does not contain guidelines for HHS to use in projecting the productivity figure. For federal fiscal year 2012, CMS has announced a negative 1.0% productivity adjustment to the market basket. CMS estimates that the
combined market basket and productivity adjustments will reduce Medicare payments under the inpatient PPS by $112.6 billion from 2010 to 2019.

The third type of reduction is in connection with the value-based purchasing program discussed in more detail below. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2013, CMS will reduce the inpatient PPS payment amount
for all discharges by the following: 1% for 2013; 1.25% for 2014; 1.5% for 2015; 1.75% for 2016; and 2% for 2017 and subsequent years. For each federal fiscal year, the total amount collected from these reductions will be pooled and used to fund
payments to hospitals that satisfy certain quality metrics. While some or all of these reductions may be recovered if a hospital satisfies these quality metrics, the recovery amounts may be delayed.

If the aggregate of the three market basket reductions described above is more than the annual market basket adjustments
made to account for inflation, there will be a reduction in the MS-DRG rates paid to hospitals. For example, for the federal fiscal year 2011 hospital inpatient PPS, the market basket increase to account for inflation was 2.6% and the aggregate
reduction due to the Health Reform Law and the documentation and coding adjustment was 3.15%. Thus, the rates paid to a hospital for inpatient services in federal fiscal year 2011 were 0.55% less than rates paid for the same services in the prior
year.

Quality-Based Payment Adjustments and Reductions for Inpatient
Services

.

Second, beginning in federal fiscal year 2013, inpatient payments will be reduced if a hospital experiences “excessive readmissions” within the 30-day period from the date of discharge for heart
attack, heart failure, pneumonia or other conditions that may be designated by CMS. Hospitals with what CMS defines as “excessive readmissions” for these conditions will receive reduced payments for all inpatient discharges, not just
discharges relating to the conditions subject to the excessive readmission standard. Each hospital’s performance will be publicly reported by CMS. On August 1, 2011, CMS issued a final rule implementing portions of this program but indicated
that it will issue in future rulemakings additional policies with respect to excessive readmissions, including the specific payment adjustment methodology.

Third, reimbursement will be reduced based on a facility’s HAC rates. An HAC is a condition that is acquired by a patient while admitted as an inpatient in a hospital, such as a surgical site
infection. Beginning in federal fiscal year 2015, the 25% of hospitals with the worst national risk-adjusted HAC rates in the previous







year will receive a 1% reduction in their total inpatient operating Medicare payments. In addition, effective July 1, 2011, the Health Reform Law prohibits the use of federal funds under the
Medicaid program to reimburse providers for medical services provided to treat HACs. However, CMS has delayed enforcement of this prohibition until July 1, 2012. In a final rule issued June 1, 2011, CMS authorizes states to add additional
provider-preventable conditions to the list of HACs for which Medicaid reimbursement will not be allowed.

Outpatient Market Basket and Productivity Adjustment.Hospital outpatient
services paid under PPS are classified into APCs. The APC payment rates are updated each calendar year based on the market basket. The first two market basket changes outlined above — the general reduction and the productivity
adjustment — apply to outpatient services as well as inpatient services, although these are applied on a calendar year basis. The percentage changes specified in the Health Reform Law summarized above as the general reduction for
inpatients — e.g., 0.2% in 2015 — are the same for outpatients.

Medicare and
Medicaid DSH Payments.The Medicare DSH program provides for additional payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of low-income patients. Under the Health Reform Law, beginning in federal fiscal
year 2014, Medicare DSH payments will be reduced to 25% of the amount they otherwise would have been absent the law. The remaining 75% of the amount that would otherwise be paid under Medicare DSH will be effectively pooled, and this pool will be
reduced further each year by a formula that reflects reductions in the national level of uninsured who are under 65 years of age. In other words, the greater the level of coverage for the uninsured nationally, the more the Medicare DSH payment
pool will be reduced. Each hospital will then be paid, out of the reduced DSH payment pool, an amount allocated based upon its level of uncompensated care.

It is difficult to predict the full impact of the Medicare DSH reductions, and CBO and CMS estimates differ by $38 billion. The Health Reform Law does not mandate what data source HHS must use to
determine the reduction, if any, in the uninsured population nationally. In addition, the Health Reform Law does not contain a definition of “uncompensated care.” As a result, it is unclear how a hospital’s share of the Medicare DSH
payment pool will be calculated. CMS could use the definition of “uncompensated care” used in connection with hospital cost reports. However, in July 2009, CMS proposed material revisions to the definition of “uncompensated care”
used for cost report purposes. Those revisions would exclude certain significant costs that had historically been covered, such as unreimbursed costs of Medicaid services. CMS has not issued a final rule, and the Health Reform Law does not require
HHS to use this definition, even if finalized, for DSH purposes. How CMS ultimately defines “uncompensated care” for purposes of these DSH funding provisions could have a material effect on a hospital’s Medicare DSH reimbursements.

In addition to Medicare DSH funding, hospitals that provide care to a disproportionately high number of
low-income patients may receive Medicaid DSH payments. The federal government distributes federal Medicaid DSH funds to each state based on a statutory formula. The states then distribute the DSH funding among qualifying hospitals. Although federal
Medicaid law defines some level of hospitals that must receive Medicaid DSH funding, states have broad discretion to define additional hospitals that also may qualify for Medicaid DSH payments and the amount of such payments. The Health Reform Law
will reduce funding for the Medicaid DSH hospital program in federal fiscal years 2014 through 2020 by the following amounts: 2014 ($500 million); 2015 ($600 million); 2016 ($600 million); 2017 ($1.8 billion); 2018
($5 billion); 2019 ($5.6 billion); and 2020 ($4 billion). In addition, the Jobs Creation Act provides for an additional Medicaid DSH reduction of $4.1 billion in federal fiscal year 2021. How such cuts are allocated among the states,
and how the states allocate these cuts among providers, have yet to be determined.

ACOs.The Health Reform Law requires HHS to establish the MSSP, which
promotes accountability and coordination of care through the creation of ACOs. Beginning no later than January 1, 2012, the program will allow certain providers and suppliers (including hospitals, physicians and other designated professionals)
to voluntarily form ACOs and work together along with other ACO participants to invest in infrastructure and redesign delivery processes to achieve high quality and efficient delivery of services. The program is intended to produce savings as a
result of improved quality and operational efficiency. ACOs that achieve quality performance standards established by HHS will be eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the







Medicare program. HHS has significant discretion to determine key elements of the program. In 2011, CMS, the OIG and certain other federal agencies released a series of rules and guidance further
defining and implementing the ACO program. These rules and guidance provide for two different ACO tracks, the first of which allows ACOs to share only in the savings under the MSSP. The second track requires ACOs to share in any savings or losses
under the MSSP but offers ACOs a greater share of any savings realized under the MSSP. As authorized by the Health Reform Law, the rules and guidance also provide for certain waivers from fraud and abuse laws for ACOs. In addition, beginning January
1, 2012, CMS has authorized 32 organizations to participate in the “Pioneer” ACO program, which is similar to, but separate from, the ACOs created under the MSSP regulations.

Bundled Payment Pilot Programs

.

Ambulatory Surgery Centers.The Health Reform Law reduces reimbursement for
ASCs through a productivity adjustment to the market basket similar to the productivity adjustment for inpatient and outpatient hospital services, beginning in federal fiscal year 2011. On November 1, 2011, CMS issued a final rule establishing a
quality reporting program for ASCs by which ASCs that fail to report on five quality measures beginning on October 1, 2012, will receive a 2% reduction in reimbursement for calendar year 2014.

Medicare Managed Care (Medicare Advantage or “MA”).Under the MA
program, the federal government contracts with private health plans to provide inpatient and outpatient benefits to beneficiaries who enroll in such plans. For 2012, approximately 12.8 million Medicare beneficiaries have elected to enroll in MA
plans. Effective in 2014, the Health Reform Law requires MA plans to keep annual administrative costs lower than 15% of annual premium revenue. The Health Reform Law reduces, over a three year period starting in 2012, premium payments to the MA
plans such that CMS’ managed care per capita premium payments are, on average, equal to traditional Medicare. In addition, the Health Reform Law implements fee payment adjustments based on service benchmarks and quality ratings. As a result of
these changes, payments to MA plans are estimated to be reduced by $138 to $145 billion between 2010 and 2019. These reductions to MA plan premium payments may cause some plans to raise premiums or limit benefits, which in turn might cause some
Medicare beneficiaries to terminate their MA coverage and enroll in traditional Medicare.

Specialty Hospital Limitations

Over the last decade, we have faced significant competition from hospitals that have physician ownership.
The Health Reform Law prohibits newly created physician-owned hospitals from billing for Medicare patients referred by their physician owners. As a result, the law effectively prevents the formation of new physician-owned hospitals after
December 31, 2010. While the law grandfathers existing physician-owned hospitals, it does not allow these hospitals to increase the percentage of physician ownership and significantly restricts their ability to expand services.







Program Integrity and Fraud and Abuse

The Health Reform Law makes several significant changes to health care fraud and abuse laws, provides additional
enforcement tools to the government, increases cooperation between agencies by establishing mechanisms for the sharing of information and enhances criminal and administrative penalties for non-compliance. For example, the Health Reform Law:
(1) provides $350 million in increased federal funding over the next 10 years to fight health care fraud, waste and abuse; (2) expands the scope of the RAC program to include MA plans and Medicaid; (3) authorizes HHS, in
consultation with the OIG, to suspend Medicare and Medicaid payments to a provider of services or a supplier “pending an investigation of a credible allegation of fraud;” (4) provides Medicare contractors with additional flexibility
to conduct random prepayment reviews; and (5) tightens up the rules for returning overpayments made by governmental health programs and expands FCA liability to include failure to timely repay identified overpayments.

Impact of Health Reform Law on the Company

The expansion of health insurance coverage under the Health Reform Law may result in a material increase in the number of
patients using our facilities who have either private or public program coverage. In addition, a disproportionately large percentage of the new Medicaid coverage is likely to be in states that currently have relatively low income eligibility
requirements. Two such states are Texas and Florida, where about one-half of the Company’s licensed beds are located. We also have a significant presence in other relatively low income eligibility states, including Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana,
Missouri, Oklahoma and Virginia. Further, the Health Reform Law provides for a value-based purchasing program, the establishment of ACOs and bundled payment pilot programs, which will create possible sources of additional revenue.

However, it is difficult to predict the size of the potential revenue gains to the Company as a result of these elements
of the Health Reform Law, because of uncertainty surrounding a number of material factors, including the following:



•how many previously uninsured individuals will obtain coverage as a result of the Health Reform Law (while the CBO estimates 32 million by 2016
and 34 million by 2021, CMS estimates almost 34 million by 2019; both agencies made a number of assumptions to derive that figure, including how many individuals will ignore substantial subsidies and decide to pay the penalty rather than obtain
health insurance and what percentage of people in the future will meet the new Medicaid income eligibility requirements);



•what percentage of the newly insured patients will be covered under the Medicaid program and what percentage will be covered by private health
insurers;



•the extent to which states will enroll new Medicaid participants in managed care programs;



•the pace at which insurance coverage expands, including the pace of different types of coverage expansion;



•the change, if any, in the volume of inpatient and outpatient hospital services that are sought by and provided to previously uninsured individuals;



•the rate paid to hospitals by private payers for newly covered individuals, including those covered through the newly created Exchanges and those
who might be covered under the Medicaid program under contracts with the state;



•the rate paid by state governments under the Medicaid program for newly covered individuals;



•the effect of the value-based purchasing program on our hospitals’ revenues and the effects of other quality programs;



•the percentage of individuals in the Exchanges who select the high deductible plans, since health insurers offering those kinds of products have
traditionally sought to pay lower rates to hospitals;







•whether the net effect of the Health Reform Law, including the prohibition on excluding individuals based on pre-existing conditions, the
requirement to keep medical costs at or above a specified minimum percentage of premium revenue, other health insurance reforms and the annual fee applied to all health insurers, will be to put pressure on the bottom line of health insurers, which
in turn might cause them to seek to reduce payments to hospitals with respect to both newly insured individuals and their existing business; and



•the possibility that implementation of the provisions expanding health insurance coverage or the entire Health Reform Law will be delayed due to
court challenges or revised or eliminated as a result of court challenges and efforts to repeal or amend the law. Numerous lawsuits have challenged the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law. Some federal courts have upheld the constitutionality
of the Health Reform Law or dismissed cases on procedural grounds. Others have held unconstitutional the requirement that individuals maintain health insurance or pay a penalty and have either found the Health Reform Law void in its entirety or left
the remainder of the law intact. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide the constitutionality of the Health Reform Law in 2012. In addition, repeal of the Health Reform Law has become a theme in political campaigns during this election year.

On the other hand, the Health Reform Law provides for significant reductions in the growth
of Medicare spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH payments and the establishment of programs where reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. Since 44.5% of our revenues in 2011 were from Medicare and Medicaid, reductions to these
programs may significantly impact the Company and could offset any positive effects of the Health Reform Law. It is difficult to predict the size of the revenue reductions to Medicare and Medicaid spending, because of uncertainty regarding a number
of material factors, including the following:



•the amount of overall revenues the Company will generate from Medicare and Medicaid business when the reductions are implemented;



•whether reductions required by the Health Reform Law will be changed by statute or by judicial decision prior to becoming effective;



•the size of the Health Reform Law’s annual productivity adjustment to the market basket;



•the amount of the Medicare DSH reductions that will be made, commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;



•the allocation to our hospitals of the Medicaid DSH reductions, commencing in federal fiscal year 2014;



•what the losses in revenues will be, if any, from the Health Reform Law’s quality initiatives;



•how successful ACOswill be at coordinating care and reducing costs or whether they will decrease reimbursement;



•the scope and nature of potential changes to Medicare reimbursement methods, such as an emphasis on bundling payments or coordination of care
programs;



•whether the Company’s revenues from upper payment limit (“UPL”) programs, or other Medicaid supplemental programs developed through a
federally approved waiver program (“Waiver Program”), will be adversely affected because there may be reductions in available state and local government funding for the programs; and



•reductions to Medicare payments CMS may impose for “excessive readmissions.”

Because of the many variables involved, we are unable to predict the net effect on the Company of the expected increases
in insured individuals using our facilities, reductions in Medicare spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid DSH funding, and numerous other provisions in the Health Reform Law that may affect the Company. Further, it is unclear how efforts to
repeal or revise the Health Reform Law and federal lawsuits challenging its constitutionality will be resolved or what the impact would be of any resulting changes to the law.







General Economic and Demographic Factors

The health care industry is impacted by the overall United States economy. The federal deficit, the growing magnitude of
Medicare expenditures and the aging of the United States population will continue to place pressure on federal health care programs.

Compliance Program

We maintain a comprehensive ethics and
compliance program that is designed to meet or exceed applicable federal guidelines and industry standards. The program is intended to monitor and raise awareness of various regulatory issues among employees and to emphasize the importance of
complying with governmental laws and regulations. As part of the ethics and compliance program, we provide annual ethics and compliance training to our employees and encourage all employees to report any violations to their supervisor, an ethics and
compliance officer or a toll-free telephone ethics line. The Health Reform Law requires providers to implement core elements of compliance program criteria to be established by HHS, on a timeline to be established by HHS, as a condition of
enrollment in the Medicare or Medicaid programs, and we may have to modify our compliance programs to comply with these new criteria.

Antitrust Laws

The federal government and most states have
enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors
and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the health care industry is
currently a priority of the Federal Trade Commission. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to various federal, state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment. We do not believe that we will be required to expend any material
amounts in order to comply with these laws and regulations.

Insurance

As is typical in the health care industry, we are subject to claims and legal actions by patients in the ordinary course
of business. Subject to a $5 million per occurrence self-insured retention, our facilities are insured by our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence. The insurance subsidiary has







obtained reinsurance for professional liability risks generally above a retention level of $15 million per occurrence. We also maintain professional liability insurance with unrelated
commercial carriers for losses in excess of amounts insured by our insurance subsidiary.

We purchase, from
unrelated insurance companies, coverage for directors and officers liability and property loss in amounts we believe are adequate. The directors and officers liability coverage includes a $25 million corporate deductible for the period prior to
November 2006, a $1 million corporate deductible for the period subsequent to November 2006 until our initial public offering in March 2011 and a $5 million corporate deductible subsequent to our initial public offering in March 2011. In
addition, we will continue to purchase coverage for our directors and officers on an ongoing basis. The property coverage includes varying deductibles depending on the cause of the property damage. These deductibles range from $500,000 per claim up
to 5% of the affected property values for certain flood and wind and earthquake related incidents.

Employees and Medical Staffs

At December 31, 2011, we had approximately 199,000 employees, including approximately
49,000 part-time employees. References herein to “employees” refer to employees of our affiliates. We are subject to various state and federal laws that regulate wages, hours, benefits and other terms and conditions relating to
employment. At December 31, 2011, employees at 38 of our hospitals are represented by various labor unions. While no elections are expected in 2012, it is possible additional hospitals may unionize in the future. We consider our employee
relations to be good and have not experienced work stoppages that have materially, adversely affected our business or results of operations. Our hospitals, like most hospitals, have experienced rising labor costs. In some markets, nurse and medical
support personnel availability has become a significant operating issue to health care providers. To address this challenge, we have implemented several initiatives to improve retention, recruiting, compensation programs and productivity.

Our hospitals are staffed by licensed physicians, including both employed physicians and physicians who are
not employees of our hospitals. Some physicians provide services in our hospitals under contracts, which generally describe a term of service, provide and establish the duties and obligations of such physicians, require the maintenance of certain
performance criteria and fix compensation for such services. Any licensed physician may apply to be accepted to the medical staff of any of our hospitals, but the hospital’s medical staff and the appropriate governing board of the hospital, in
accordance with established credentialing criteria, must approve acceptance to the staff. Members of the medical staffs of our hospitals often also serve on the medical staffs of other hospitals and may terminate their affiliation with one of our
hospitals at any time.

We may be required to continue to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain
nurses and other medical support personnel or to hire more expensive temporary or contract personnel. As a result, our labor costs could increase. We also depend on the available labor pool of semi-skilled and unskilled employees in each of the
markets in which we operate. Certain proposed changes in federal labor laws and the National Labor Relations Board’s (the “NLRB”) modification of its election procedures could increase the likelihood of employee unionization attempts.
To the extent a significant portion of our employee base unionizes, our costs could increase materially. In addition, the states in which we operate could adopt mandatory nurse-staffing ratios or could reduce mandatory nurse-staffing ratios already
in place. State-mandated nurse-staffing ratios could significantly affect labor costs, and have an adverse impact on revenues if we are required to limit patient admissions in order to meet the required ratios.
