Industry

General Background

KLA-Tencor’s core focus is the semiconductor industry. The semiconductor fabrication process begins with a bare silicon wafer—a round disk that is typically 150 millimeters, 200 millimeters or 300 millimeters in diameter, about as thick as a credit card and gray in color. The process of manufacturing wafers is in itself highly sophisticated, involving the creation of large ingots of silicon by pulling them out of a vat of molten silicon. The ingots are then sliced into wafers. Prime silicon wafers are then polished to a mirror finish. Other, more specialized wafers, such as epitaxial silicon (“epi”), silicon-on-insulator (“SOI”), gallium nitride (“GaN”) and silicon carbide (“SiC”), are also common in the semiconductor industry.









The manufacturing cycle of an IC is grouped into three phases: design, fabrication and testing. IC design involves the architectural layout of the circuit, as well as design verification and reticle generation. The fabrication of a chip is accomplished by depositing a series of film layers that act as conductors, semiconductors or insulators on bare wafers. The deposition of these film layers is interspersed with numerous other process steps that create circuit patterns, remove portions of the film layers, and perform other functions such as heat treatment, measurement and inspection. Most advanced chip designs require hundreds of individual steps, many of which are performed multiple times. Most chips consist of two main structures: the lower structure, typically consisting of transistors or capacitors which perform the “smart” functions of the chip; and the upper “interconnect” structure, typically consisting of circuitry which connects the components in the lower structure. When all of the layers on the wafer have been fabricated, each chip on the wafer is tested for functionality. The wafer is then cut into individual chips, and those chips that passed functional testing are packaged. Final testing is performed on all packaged chips.

Current Trends

The growth of consumer demand for mobile devices, including smartphones, tablets and wearable devices, is currently driving growth in the electronics industry and, as a result, growth in the semiconductor industry as well. Contained within each of these latest consumer devices are advanced semiconductors that are helping to enable the features consumers want in device performance, such as smaller product form factors, lower power requirements, bigger and brighter screens and speed, at a lower cost. Alongside this market growth, the industry continues to experience a high rate of change in technology, with the emergence of new techniques and architectures in production today, such as three-dimensional (“3D”) transistors, advanced patterning lithography, advanced wafer-level packaging and semiconductors with critical dimensions at 28 nanometer and below. KLA-Tencor’s inspection and measurement technologies play a key role in enabling our customers’ advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes to support these trends.

Companies that anticipate future market demands by developing and refining new technologies and manufacturing processes are better positioned to lead in the semiconductor market. Accelerating the yield ramp and maximizing production yields of high-performance devices are key goals of modern semiconductor manufacturing. Ramping to high-volume production ahead of competitors can dramatically increase the revenue an IC manufacturer realizes for a given product. During past industry cycles, semiconductor manufacturers generally contended with a few key new technologies or market trends, such as a specific design rule shrink. In today’s market, driven by consumer demand for low-cost electronic goods, the leading semiconductor manufacturers are investing in simultaneous production integration of multiple new process technologies, some requiring new substrate and film materials, new geometries, advanced lithography and advanced packaging techniques.

While many of these technologies have been adopted at the development and pilot production stages of chip manufacturing, significant challenges and risks associated with each technology have affected the adoption of these technologies into full-volume production. For example, as design rules decrease, yields become more sensitive to the size and density of defects and device performance characteristics (namely speed, capacity or power management) become more sensitive to parameters, such as line width and film thickness variation. New process materials, such as high-k dielectrics, SOI wafers and immersion lithography-capable photoresists, require extensive characterization before they can be used in the manufacturing process. Moving several of these advanced technologies into production at once only adds to the risks that chipmakers face.

The continuing evolution of semiconductor devices to smaller geometries and more complex multi-level circuitry has significantly increased the performance and cost requirements of the capital equipment used to manufacture these devices. Construction of an advanced wafer fabrication facility today can cost over $5 billion, substantially more than previous-generation facilities. In addition, chipmakers are demanding increased productivity and higher returns from their manufacturing equipment and are also seeking ways to extend the performance of their existing equipment.

By developing new process control and yield management tools that help chipmakers accelerate the adoption of these new technologies into volume production, we enable our customers to better leverage these increasingly expensive facilities and significantly improve their return on investment (“ROI”). Once customers’ production lines are operating at high volume, our tools help ensure that yields are stable and process excursions are identified for quick resolution. In addition, the move to each new generation’s smaller design rules, coupled with new materials and device innovation, has increased in-process variability, which requires an increase in inspection and metrology sampling.









KLA-Tencor systems not only analyze defectivity and metrology issues at critical points in the wafer, reticle and IC manufacturing processes, but also provide information to our customers so that they can identify and address the underlying process problems. The ability to locate the source of defects and resolve the underlying process issues enables our customers to improve control over their manufacturing processes. This helps them increase their yield of high-performance parts and deliver their products to market faster—thus maximizing their profits. With our broad portfolio of application-focused technologies and our dedicated yield technology expertise, we are in position to be a key supplier of comprehensive yield management solutions for customers’ next-generation products, helping our customers respond to the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes, the transition to new production materials, new device and circuit architecture, more demanding lithography processes, and new back-end packaging techniques.

We also provide refurbished KLA-Tencor tools as part of our K-T CertifiedTMprogram for customers manufacturing larger design-rule devices, as well as comprehensive service and support for our products.

Chip Manufacturing

KLA-Tencor’s comprehensive portfolio of defect inspection and metrology products, and related service, software and other offerings, helps chip manufacturers manage yield throughout the entire semiconductor fabrication process—from research and development to final volume production. These products and offerings are designed to provide comprehensive solutions to help our customers to accelerate their development and production ramp cycles, to achieve higher and more stable semiconductor die yields, and to improve their overall profitability.

Front-End Defect Inspection

KLA-Tencor’s front-end defect inspection tools cover a broad range of yield applications within the IC manufacturing environment, including: research and development; incoming wafer qualification; reticle qualification; and tool, process and line monitoring. Patterned and unpatterned wafer inspectors find particles, pattern defects and electrical issues on the front surface, back surface and edge of the wafer, allowing engineers to detect and monitor critical yield excursions. Fabs rely on our high sensitivity reticle inspection systems to identify defects in reticles at an early stage and to prevent reticle defects from printing on production wafers. The defect data generated by our inspectors is compiled and reduced to relevant root-cause and yield-analysis information with our suite of data management tools. By implementing our front-end defect inspection and analysis systems, chipmakers are able to take quick corrective action, resulting in faster yield improvement and better time to market.

In June 2015, we introduced the 8920 system, which provides high productivity inspection for a diverse range of applications, including advanced IC front-end lithography and chemical mechanical planarization (“CMP”) processes, automotive device fabrication and advanced legacy fab process control. In July 2014, we launched several front-end defect inspection products that help accelerate yield for next-generation design node devices: 2920 Series, Puma™ 9850 and Surfscan®SP5. The 2920 Series broadband plasma patterned wafer inspection systems are used to discover and monitor defects related to design or process issues, supporting advanced IC development and ramp. The Puma™ 9850 laser scanning patterned wafer inspection system utilizes a range of operating modes to support yield-relevant defect capture for lithography and etch applications and cost-effective excursion monitoring for film and CMP process modules. The Surfscan®SP5 unpatterned wafer inspection system utilizes deep ultra-violet (“DUV”) optical technologies and high throughput to assess incoming wafer quality, evaluate and qualify processes during R&D and monitor processes during production.

Defect Review

KLA-Tencor’s defect review systems capture high resolution images of the defects detected by inspection tools. These images enable defect classification, helping chipmakers to identify and resolve yield issues. KLA-Tencor’s suite of defect inspectors, defect review and classification tools and data management systems form a broad solution for finding, identifying and tracking yield-critical defects and process issues. In July 2014, we introduced the eDRTM-7110, an electron-beam wafer defect review and classification system that utilizes improved automatic defect classification capability to quickly identify detected defects and produce an accurate representation of the detected defect population.

Advanced Packaging Process Control

KLA-Tencor offers standalone and cluster inspection and metrology systems for various applications in the field of advanced semiconductor packaging (i.e., at the middle and back-end of the semiconductor manufacturing process). Our CIRCL-AP™ all-surface inspection, metrology and review system supports advanced wafer-level packaging processes, such as 2.5D/3D IC integration using through silicon vias (“TSVs”), wafer-level chip scale packaging (“WLCSP”) and fan-out wafer-level packaging (“FOWLP”). Used for packaging applications associated with LEDs, MEMS, image sensors and flip-chip packaging, our WI-22x0 Series products focus on front side wafer inspection and provide feedback on wafer surface quality, quality of the wafer dicing, or quality of wafer bumps, pads and pillars. Our component inspector products inspect various semiconductor components that are handled in a tray, such as microprocessors or memory chips. Component inspection capability includes 3D coplanarity inspection, measurement of the evenness of the contacts, component height and two-dimensional (“2D”) surface inspection.

In April 2015, we introduced two systems that support advanced packaging applications: CIRCL-AP™ and the ICOS®T830. The CIRCL-APTMincludes the 8 Series front side defect inspection and metrology module, the CV350i edge inspection and metrology module and the Micro300 2D and 3D metrology module. It provides cost-efficient process control for a range of advanced wafer-level packaging processes. The ICOS®T830 provides automated, optical inspection of IC packages, leveraging high sensitivity and 2D and 3D measurements to determine final package quality for a wide range of package types and sizes.

Metrology

KLA-Tencor’s array of metrology solutions addresses IC and substrate manufacturing, as well as scientific research and other applications. Precise metrology and control of pattern dimensions, film thicknesses, layer-to-layer alignment, pattern placement, surface topography and electro-optical properties are important in many industries as critical dimensions narrow, film thicknesses shrink to countable numbers of atomic layers and devices become more complex.









In August 2014, we introduced our 5D™ patterning control solution which addresses five elements of patterning process control--the three geometrical dimensions of device structures, time-to-results and overall equipment efficiency. Our 5D™ patterning control solution supports advanced patterning technologies through the characterization, optimization and monitoring of fab-wide processes. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, we launched several metrology products that are key components in our 5D™ patterning control solution and help accelerate the ramp of innovative patterning techniques for advanced design node devices:

Overlay Metrology

In February 2015, we introduced the ArcherTM500LCM, a high performance overlay metrology system which provides accurate overlay error data that can be used for scanner corrections or for identification of inline excursions, helping engineers determine when to re-work wafers or adjust processes to meet patterning requirements. Offering both imaging and laser-based scatterometry measurement technologies, the ArcherTM500LCM provides flexible overlay control for all process layers in leading-edge development and high volume production.

Film Thickness and Stress Metrology

In February 2015, we introduced the SpectraFilm™ LD10 system, which utilizes a laser-driven plasma light source to produce reliable, high-precision film measurements for a broad range of film layers, including the thin, multilayer film stacks used in forming complex device structures such as FinFETs. An infrared-based subsystem on the SpectraFilmTMLD10 enables characterization of thick films and film stacks, such as those found in 3D NAND flash devices.

Patterned Wafer Geometry Metrology

In August 2014, we introduced the WaferSightTMPWG system, which measures patterned wafer geometry after a wide range of IC processes, helping identify and monitor variations that can affect patterning. The WaferSightTMPWG enables faster process ramp, overlay control, lithography focus window control and in-line process monitoring for processes such as thin films, etch, CMP and rapid thermal processing (“RTP”).

Reticle Registration Metrology

In August 2014, we introduced the LMS IPRO6 system, which is used by mask shops for comprehensive characterization of reticle pattern placement error, which is a direct contributor to wafer-level pattern overlay error. The LMS IPRO6 utilizes model-based metrology to accurately measure reticle registration for on-device pattern features and standard registration marks, producing higher sampling for better determination of mask quality.

Metrology Data Analysis

In August 2014, we introduced K-T Analyzer®9.0, which offers advanced, run-time data analysis for a wide range of metrology system types, including overlay, reticle registration, wafer geometry, films, critical dimension and device profile metrology systems.

The products that we launched during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 further strengthened our broad range of offerings that support the metrology market. The ArcherTMSeries of overlay metrology tools enable characterization of overlay error on lithography process layers for advanced patterning technologies. The SpectraShapeTMfamily of optical CD and shape metrology systems fully characterize and monitor the critical dimensions and 3D shapes of geometrically complex features incorporated by some IC manufacturers in their latest generation devices. Finally, the SpectraFilmTMand AlerisTMfamilies of film metrology tools provide reliable and precise measurement of film thickness, refractive index, stress and composition for a broad range of film layers. In addition, we offer a number of other products for the metrology market, as reflected in the product table at the conclusion of this “Products” section.

In-Situ Process Monitoring

KLA-Tencor’s SensArray®SensorWafers are a portfolio of advanced wireless and wired temperature monitoring wafers that capture the effect of the process environment on production wafers. These SensorWafers provide unique insight into thermal uniformity and profile temperature under real production conditions. SensArray products are used in many semiconductor and flat panel display fabrication processes, including lithography, etch and deposition.









Lithography Software

KLA-Tencor’s PROLITHTMproduct line provides researchers at advanced IC manufacturers, lithography hardware suppliers, track companies and material providers with virtual lithography software to explore critical-feature designs, manufacturability and process-limited yield of proposed lithographic technologies without the time and expense of printing hundreds of test wafers using experimental materials and prototype process equipment. OurProDATA™ process window analysis software tool speeds critical decision making within the IC fab by enabling fast, easy and accurate analysis of experimental data, including CD, roughness, sidewall angle, top loss and pattern collapse.

In January 2015, we introduced PROLITHTMX5.1, which provides simulation capability for anamorphic imaging for high numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (“EUV”) lithography, and supports all lithography technologies, including 193nm immersion lithography, spacer-based Self-Aligned Double Patterning ("SADP") and thick resist lithography for 3D interconnects and MEMS manufacturing. In May 2015, we released the latest version of our process window analysis software tool, ProDATA™ V2.0, which provides engineers with a systematic, robust approach to understanding and optimizing lithography processes across the IC fab.

Wafer Manufacturing

KLA-Tencor’s portfolio of products focused on the demands of wafer manufacturers includes inspection, metrology and data management systems. Specialized inspection tools assess surface quality and detect, count and bin defects during the wafer manufacturing process and as a critical part of outgoing inspection. Wafer geometry tools ensure that the wafer is extremely flat and uniform in thickness, with precisely controlled surface topography. Specifications for wafer defectivity, geometry and surface quality are tightening as the dimensions of transistors become so small that the geometry of the substrate can substantially affect transistor performance.

Our wafer inspection portfolio is anchored by the Surfscan®SP3 Series defect inspection systems designed to enable development and production monitoring of polished wafers, epi wafers and engineered substrates. The SURFmonitorTMmodule characterizes wafer surface quality and captures the low-contrast defects. The WaferSightTMplatform offers bare wafer geometry and nanotopography metrology capabilities. Other products that we offer for the wafer manufacturing market are highlighted in the product table at the conclusion of this “Products” section.

Reticle Manufacturing

Error-free reticles, or masks, are necessary to achieving high semiconductor device yields, since reticle defects can be replicated in every die on production wafers. KLA-Tencor offers high sensitivity reticle inspection and metrology systems for mask shops, designed to help them manufacture reticles that are free of pattern defects that could print on the wafers and meet pattern placement and critical dimension uniformity specifications. In August 2014, we introduced the LMS IPRO6 reticle metrology system which enables improved characterization of mask quality through accurate measurement of reticle pattern placement error for on-device pattern features in addition to standard registration marks.

Our reticle inspection portfolio includes the TeronTM600 Series for development and manufacturing of advanced optical and EUV masks, the TeraScanTM500XR system for mask shop production of reticles for the 32nm node and above and our X5.2TMand TeronTMSL650 products for reticle quality control capability for IC fabs. These products include the capability for mapping critical dimension uniformity across the reticle. In addition, we offer the LMS IPRO line of reticle metrology systems for measuring pattern placement error. If the pattern on the reticle is displaced from its intended location, overlay error can result on the wafer, which can lead to electrical continuity issues affecting yield, performance or reliability of the IC device.

LED and Compound Semiconductor Manufacturing

LEDs are becoming more commonly used in solid-state lighting, television and notebook backlighting, and automotive applications. As LED device makers target aggressive cost and performance targets, they place significant emphasis on improved process control and yield during the manufacturing process.

KLA-Tencor offers a portfolio of three systems to help LED manufacturers reduce production costs and increase product output: Candela®8620, Klarity®LED and WI-2280. The Candela 8620 substrate and epi wafer inspection system provides automated inspection and quality control of LED substrates, detecting defects that can impact device performance, yield and field reliability. Klarity LED is an automated defect data management and analysis system for LED yield enhancement. The WI-2280 system is a patterned wafer inspection tool that is designed specifically for defect inspection and 2D metrology for LED applications.









Our primary products for compound semiconductor manufacturing include Candela CS20 and the P-Series Stylus Profiler, used for the inspection of substrates, epi-layers and process films. In addition, the Candela CS920 is used by power device manufacturers for defect inspection and classification on SiC substrate and epi wafers.

Data Storage Media/Head Manufacturing

Advancements in data storage are being driven by a wave of innovative consumer electronics with small form factors and immense storage capacities, as well as an increasing need for high-volume storage options to back up modern methods of remote computing and networking (such as cloud computing). Our process control and yield management solutions are designed to enable customers to rapidly understand and resolve complex manufacturing problems, which can help improve time to market and product yields. In the front-end and back-end of thin-film head wafer manufacturing, we offer the same process control equipment that we serve to the semiconductor industry. In addition, we offer an extensive range of test equipment and surface profilers with particular strength in photolithography. In substrate and media manufacturing, we offer metrology and defect inspection solutions with KLA-Tencor’s optical surface analyzers.

MEMS Manufacturing

The increasing demand for MEMS technology is coming from diverse industries such as automotive, space and consumer electronics. MEMS have the potential to revolutionize nearly every product category by bringing together silicon-based microelectronics with micromachining technology, making possible the realization of complete systems-on-a-chip. KLA-Tencor offers tools and techniques for this emerging market, such as defect inspection and review, optical inspection and surface profiling, which were first developed for the integrated circuit industry.

General Purpose/Lab Applications

A range of industries, including general scientific and materials research and optoelectronics, require measurements of surface topography to either control their processes or research new material characteristics. Typical measurement parameters that our tools address include flatness, roughness, curvature, peak-to-valley, asperity, waviness, texture, volume, sphericity, slope, density, stress, bearing ratio and distance (mainly in the micron to nanometer range). In September 2014, we introduced the Alpha-Step®D-500 stylus profiler designed for 2D measurements of surface topography and the Alpha-Step D-600 stylus profiler designed for high resolution 2D and 3D surface topography measurements. The two systems support a broad range of R&D and production applications.

Customers

To support our growing global customer base, we maintain a significant presence throughout Asia, the United States and Europe, staffed with local sales and applications engineers, customer and field service engineers and yield management consultants. We count among our largest customers the leading semiconductor manufacturers in each of these regions.

For the fiscal years endedJune 30, 2015,2014and2013, the following customers each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues:Year ended June 30,201520142013Intel CorporationIntel CorporationIntel CorporationSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company LimitedTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited

Our business depends upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers, which in turn is driven by the current and anticipated market demand for ICs and products utilizing ICs. We do not consider our business to be seasonal in nature, but it is cyclical with respect to the capital equipment procurement practices of semiconductor manufacturers, and it is impacted by the investment patterns of such manufacturers in different global markets. Downturns in the semiconductor industry or slowdowns in the worldwide economy as well as customer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Sales, Service and Marketing

Our sales, service and marketing efforts are aimed at building long-term relationships with our customers. We focus on providing a single and comprehensive resource for the full breadth of process control and yield management products and services. Our customers benefit from the simplified planning and coordination, as well as the increased equipment compatibility, which are realized as a result of dealing with a single supplier for multiple products and services. Our revenues are derived primarily from product sales, mostly through our direct sales force.

We believe that the size and location of our field sales, service and applications engineering, and marketing organizations represent a competitive advantage in our served markets. We have direct sales forces in Asia, the United States and Europe. We maintain an export compliance program that is designed to meet the requirements of the United States Departments of Commerce and State.

As ofJune 30, 2015, we employed approximately 2,390 full-time sales and related personnel, service engineers and applications engineers. In addition to sales and service offices in the United States, we conduct sales, marketing and services out of wholly-owned subsidiaries or branches in other countries, including Belgium, China, Germany, Israel, Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan. International revenues accounted for approximately71%,76%and70%of our total revenues in the fiscal years endedJune 30, 2015,2014and2013, respectively. Additional information regarding our revenues from foreign operations for our last three fiscal years can be found in Note 17, “Segment Reporting and Geographic Information” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

We believe that sales outside the United States will continue to be a significant percentage of our total revenues. Our future performance will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to compete successfully in Asia, one of the largest markets for our equipment. Our ability to compete in this area is dependent upon the continuation of favorable trading relationships between countries in the region and the United States, and our continuing ability to maintain satisfactory relationships with leading semiconductor companies in the region.









International sales and operations may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls, restrictions on export technology, political instability, trade restrictions, changes in tariffs and the difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations. In addition, international sales may be adversely affected by the economic conditions in each country and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and such fluctuations may negatively impact our ability to compete on price with local providers or the value of revenues we generate from our international business. Although we attempt to manage some of the currency risk inherent in non-U.S. dollar product sales through hedging activities, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be adequate. These factors, as well as any of the other risk factors related to our international business and operations that are described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” could have a material adverse effect on our future business and financial results.

Backlog

Our shipment backlog for systems and associated warranty totaled $984 million and $977 million as ofJune 30, 2015and2014, respectively, and primarily consists of sales orders where written customer requests have been received and the delivery is anticipated within the next 12 months. Orders for service contracts and unreleased products are excluded from shipment backlog. All orders are subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, often with limited or no penalties. We make adjustments for shipment backlog obtained from acquired companies, sales order cancellations, customer delivery date changes and currency adjustments. Shipment backlog is not subject to normal accounting controls for information that is either reported in or derived from our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the concept of shipment backlog is not defined in the accounting literature, making comparisons between periods and with other companies difficult and potentially misleading.

Our revenue backlog, which includes the gross value of sales orders where physical deliveries have been completed, but for which revenue has not been recognized pursuant to our policy for revenue recognition, totaled $221 million and $269 million as ofJune 30, 2015and2014, respectively. Orders for service contracts are excluded from revenue backlog.

Because customers can potentially change delivery schedules or delay or cancel orders, and because some orders are received and shipped within the same quarter, our shipment backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of business volumes or actual sales for any succeeding periods. The cyclicality of the semiconductor industry combined with the lead times from our suppliers sometimes result in timing disparities between, on the one hand, our ability to manufacture, deliver and install products and, on the other, the requirements of our customers. In our efforts to balance the requirements of our customers with the availability of resources, management of our operating model and other factors, we often must exercise discretion and judgment as to the timing and prioritization of manufacturing, deliveries and installations of products, which may impact the timing of revenue recognition with respect to such products.

Research and Development

The market for yield management and process monitoring systems is characterized by rapid technological development and product innovation. These technical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. We believe that continued and timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products are necessary to maintain our competitive position. Accordingly, we devote a significant portion of our human and financial resources to research and development programs and seek to maintain close relationships with customers to remain responsive to their needs. In addition, we may enter into certain strategic development and engineering programs whereby certain government agencies or other third parties fund a portion of our research and development costs. As ofJune 30, 2015, we employed approximately 1,480 full-time research and development personnel.

Our key research and development activities during the fiscal year endedJune 30, 2015involved the development of process control and yield management equipment aimed at addressing the challenges posed by shrinking device sizes, the transition to new production materials, new device and circuit architecture, more demanding lithography processes and new back-end packaging techniques. For information regarding our research and development expenses during the last three fiscal years, including costs offset by our strategic development and engineering programs, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.









The strength of our competitive positions in many of our existing markets is largely due to our leading technology, which is the result of our continuing significant investments in product research and development. Even during down cycles in the semiconductor industry, we have remained committed to significant engineering efforts toward both product improvement and new product development in order to enhance our competitive position. New product introductions, however, may contribute to fluctuations in operating results, since customers may defer ordering existing products, and, if new products have reliability or quality problems, those problems may result in reduced orders, higher manufacturing costs, delays in acceptance of and payment for new products, and additional service and warranty expenses. There can be no assurance that we will successfully develop and manufacture new products, or that new products introduced by us will be accepted in the marketplace. If we do not successfully introduce new products, our results of operations will be adversely affected.

Manufacturing, Raw Materials and Supplies

We perform system design, assembly and testing in-house and utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of components and major subassemblies. Our in-house manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that are acquired through third-party vendors and integrating those subassemblies into our finished products. Our principal manufacturing activities take place in the United States (Milpitas, California), Singapore, Israel, Germany and China. As ofJune 30, 2015, we employed approximately 970 full-time manufacturing personnel.

Some critical parts, components and subassemblies (collectively, “parts”) that we use are designed by us and manufactured by suppliers in accordance with our specifications, while other parts are standard commercial products. We use numerous vendors to supply parts and raw materials for the manufacture and support of our products. Although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that these parts and raw materials are available from multiple suppliers, this is not always possible, and certain parts and raw materials included in our systems may be obtained only from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Through our business interruption planning, we endeavor to minimize the risk of production interruption by, among other things, monitoring the financial condition of suppliers of key parts and raw materials, identifying (but not necessarily qualifying) possible alternative suppliers of such parts and materials, and ensuring adequate inventories of key parts and raw materials are available to maintain manufacturing schedules.

Although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers, in some cases the partial or complete loss of certain of these sources, or disruptions within our suppliers’ often-complex supply chains, could disrupt scheduled deliveries to customers, damage customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Competition

The worldwide market for process control and yield management systems is highly competitive. In each of our product markets, we face competition from established and potential competitors, such as Applied Materials, Inc., ASML Holding N.V., Hermes Microvision, Inc., Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation and Nanometrics, Inc., some of which may have greater financial, research, engineering, manufacturing and marketing resources than we have. We may also face future competition from new market entrants from other overseas and domestic sources. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their current products and processes and to introduce new products and processes with improved price and performance characteristics. We believe that, to remain competitive, we will require significant financial resources to offer a broad range of products, to maintain customer service and support centers worldwide, and to invest in product and process research and development.

We believe that, while price and delivery are important competitive factors, the customers’ overriding requirement is for systems that easily and effectively incorporate automated and highly accurate inspection and metrology capabilities into their existing manufacturing processes to enhance productivity. Significant competitive factors in the market for process control and yield management systems include system performance, ease of use, reliability, interoperability with the existing installed base and technical service and support, as well as overall cost of ownership.

Management believes that we are well positioned in the market with respect to both our products and services. However, any loss of competitive position could negatively impact our prices, customer orders, revenues, gross margins and market share, any of which would negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.









Acquisitions and Alliances

We continuously evaluate strategic acquisitions and alliances to expand our technologies, product offerings and distribution capabilities. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including management issues and costs in connection with integration of the operations, technologies and products of the acquired companies, and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies. The inability to manage these risks effectively could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights

We protect our proprietary technology through reliance on a variety of intellectual property laws, including patent, copyright and trade secret. We have filed and obtained a number of patents in the United States and abroad and intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our technology through intellectual property laws. In addition, from time to time we acquire license rights under United States and foreign patents and other proprietary rights of third parties, and we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality and other agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures.

Although we consider patents and other intellectual property significant to our business, due to the rapid pace of innovation within the process control and yield management systems industry, we believe that our protection through patent and other intellectual property rights is less important than factors such as our technological expertise, continuing development of new systems, market penetration, installed base and the ability to provide comprehensive support and service to customers worldwide.

No assurance can be given that patents will be issued on any of our applications, that license assignments will be made as anticipated, or that our patents, licenses or other proprietary rights will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. No assurance can be given that any patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with a competitive advantage. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to protect our technology or that competitors will not be able to independently develop similar or functionally competitive technology.

Environmental Matters

We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local governmental laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, including without limitation the management of hazardous materials that we use in our business operations. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations or competitive position.

However, any failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may subject us to a range of consequences, including fines, suspension of certain of our business activities, limitations on our ability to sell our products, obligations to remediate environmental contamination, and criminal and civil liabilities or other sanctions. In addition, changes in environmental laws and regulations could require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment, alter our manufacturing processes or use substitute materials. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to future liabilities.

Employees

As ofJune 30, 2015, we employed approximately 5,880 full-time employees. Except for our employees in Belgium (where a trade union delegation has been recognized) and our employees in the German operations of our MIE business unit (who are represented by employee works council), none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced work stoppages and believe that our employee relations are good.

Competition is intense in the recruiting of personnel in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industry. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified management, marketing and technical employees.

As discussed in our Note 15, “Restructuring Charges,” we announced in April 2015 a plan to reduce our global workforce to streamline our organization and business processes in response to changing customer requirements in our industry. The goals of this reduction are to enable continued innovation, direct our resources toward our best opportunities and lower our ongoing expense run rate. Refer to the above footnote for additional details.
