Management Overview

General Description of our Business

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and
information they need to efficiently research, plan, book and experience travel. We have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents and travel service providers. We make
available, on a stand-alone and package basis, travel products and services provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other travel product and service companies. We also
offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor®Media Network and on our transaction-based websites.

Our portfolio of brands, which is described below, includes: Expedia.com®, hotels.com®, Hotwire.comTM, TripAdvisor Media Network, Expedia Affiliate Network (formerly “Worldwide Travel Exchange” and
“Interactive Affiliate Network”), Classic Vacations®, Expedia Local ExpertTM, Expedia®CruiseShipCenters®, EgenciaTM, eLongTM, Inc. (“eLong”) and VenereTMNet SpA (“Venere”). In addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. We refer to
Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia,” the “Company,” “us,” “we” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Summary of the Spin-Off from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”) announced its plan to separate into two independent public companies. We refer to this transaction as the “Spin-Off.” A new
company, Expedia, Inc., was incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related businesses. On August 9, 2005, the Spin-Off was completed and Expedia, Inc. shares began trading on The
Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “EXPE.”







Equity Ownership and Voting Control

As of December 31, 2009, there were approximately 263,929,232 shares of Expedia common stock, 25,599,998 shares of Expedia
Class B common stock and 751 shares of Expedia preferred stock outstanding. Also as of December 31, 2009, Liberty Media Corporation (“Liberty”), through a wholly-owned subsidiary, beneficially owned approximately 27% of
Expedia’s outstanding common stock and 100% of Expedia’s outstanding Class B common stock. As of such date, Barry Diller, Chairman and Senior Executive of Expedia (through his own holdings and holdings of Liberty, over which
Mr. Diller generally has voting control pursuant to an irrevocable proxy granted by Liberty under the Stockholders Agreement described below) controlled approximately 59% of the outstanding total voting power of Expedia.

Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, dated as of August 9, 2005, as amended, between Liberty and Mr. Diller, Mr. Diller is
effectively able to control the outcome of nearly all matters submitted to a vote or for the consent of Expedia’s stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the Expedia common stockholders of 25% of the members of Expedia’s
Board of Directors and certain matters as to which a separate class vote of the holders of Expedia common stock or Expedia preferred stock is required under Delaware law). In addition, pursuant to the Governance Agreement, dated as of August 9,
2005, among Expedia, Liberty and Mr. Diller, each of Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent to certain significant corporate actions in the event that Expedia or any of its subsidiaries incurs any new obligations for
borrowed money within the definition of “total debt” set forth in the Governance Agreement for as long as Expedia’s ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined therein, equals or exceeds eight to one.

Portfolio of Brands

Expedia leverages its brand portfolio to target the broadest possible range of travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers. Our brands provide a wide selection of travel products and services, from
simple, discounted travel to more complex, luxury travel. Our travel offerings primarily consist of airline flights, hotel stays, car rentals, destination services, cruises and package travel, which encompasses multiple travel products. We also
offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction-based websites.

Expedia.com.Our Expedia-branded websites make a large variety of travel products and services available
directly to travelers through our U.S.-based website, www.expedia.com, as well as through localized versions of the Expedia website in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Expedia-branded websites target many different types of travelers, from families booking a summer vacation to individual travelers arranging a quick weekend getaway.
Travelers can search for, compare information about (including pricing, availability and traveler reviews) and book travel products and services on Expedia-branded websites, including airline tickets, lodging, car rentals, cruises and many
destination services — such as airport transfers, local attractions and tours — from a large number of suppliers, on both a stand-alone and package basis.

Hotels.com.Our hotels.com website provides a broad selection of hotel properties to travelers, who can plan,
shop for and book lodging accommodations, from traditional hotels to vacation rentals. Hotels.com seeks to provide travelers with premium content and service through our U.S.-based website, www.hotels.com, as well as through nearly 80 localized
versions in the Americas, Europe, Asia Pacific and South Africa. With hotels.com, we differentiate our offering by positioning the brand as the hotel expert, with premium content about lodging properties.

Hotwire.Our discount travel website, www.hotwire.com, makes available airline tickets, hotel rooms, rental
cars, cruises and vacation packages. Hotwire.com’s approach matches flexible, price-sensitive travelers with suppliers who have excess seats, rooms and cars they wish to fill without affecting the public’s perception of their brands.
Hotwire.com travelers may enjoy significant discounts by electing to book travel services “opaquely,” without knowing certain itinerary details such as brand, time of departure and exact hotel location,







while suppliers create value from excess availability without diluting their core brand-loyal traveler base. Recent product innovation allows air travelers to discover available discounts by
altering details of their air travel plans such as date of departure or destination airport. Hotwire.com works with many domestic and international airlines, including U.S. full-service major network airlines, top hotels in hundreds of cities
and resort destinations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean and major car rental companies in the United States. In 2008, Hotwire acquired a controlling interest in CarRentals.com, an online car rental marketing and retail
firm offering a diverse selection of car rentals direct to consumers.

Venere.Our Venere-branded
websites make approximately 30,000 hotel properties available to European consumers, through the website www.venere.com, and provide hoteliers with geographically diverse sources of demand. Venere has direct agency-based relationships with hotels
around the world. In addition, Venere hotel supply has been made available through certain of our Expedia-branded and hotels.com-branded websites.

The TripAdvisor Media Network.TripAdvisor, our comprehensive online travel search engine and directory, aggregates traveler opinions and unbiased articles about cities,
hotels, restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through www.tripadvisor.com and localized versions of the site in Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Turkey
and the United Kingdom. TripAdvisor also operates in China under the brand daodao.com. In addition to travel-related information, TripAdvisor’s destination-specific search results provide links to the websites of TripAdvisor’s travel
partners (travel providers and marketers) through which travelers can make related travel arrangements. TripAdvisor has also acquired and now operates a number of travel media content properties within the TripAdvisor Media Network, including
airfarewatchdog.comTM, bookingbuddy.comTM, cruisecritic.comTM, flipkey.comTM, holidaywatchdog.comTM, independenttraveler.comTM, kuxun.cn, onetime.comTM, seatguru.com®, smartertravel.comTM, travel-library.comTM, travelpod.comTM, and
virtualtourist.comTM, expanding the Network’s reach,
product breadth and appeal to domestic and international advertisers.

Expedia Affiliate
Network.Our private label and co-brand programs make travel products and services available to travelers through third-party company-branded websites. The products and services made available through
www.expediaaffiliate.com and www.wwte.com are substantially similar to those made available on Expedia-branded and hotels.com-branded websites, respectively. We generally compensate participants in the WWTE®and IANTMprivate label programs on a revenue-share basis. We also leverage our WWTE and IAN platforms to make Expedia and
hotels.com-branded sites available in various international points of sale.

Classic
Vacations.Classic Vacations offers individually tailored vacations primarily through a national network of third-party retail travel agents. We deliver a full line of premium vacation packages — air, hotels, car
rentals, activities and private transportation — to create customized luxury vacations in Hawaii, the Caribbean, Mexico, Costa Rica, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tahiti. Travel agents and travelers can preview our product
offering through our websites, www.classicforagents.com and www.classicvacations.com.

Expedia Local
Expert.Our network of travel desks located at hotels and resorts in Hawaii, Las Vegas, Mexico, Orlando and San Francisco enables travelers to enjoy local tours, attractions and dining, as well as purchase airport
transfers and other travel-related services. Our network expanded through our acquisition of Activity World and Activity Hut, destination service providers in Hawaii in 2004 and 2006, respectively, and our 2005 acquisition of Premier Getaways in
Florida.

Expedia CruiseShipCenters.    Majority-owned by Expedia, CruiseShipCenters is one of North
America’s leading sellers of cruise vacations. CruiseShipCenters has over 107 retail locations, a team of 2,000 professionally-trained cruise consultants and a searchable online database of more than 10,000 cruise vacations.

Egencia.Our full-service travel management company offers travel products and services available to
corporations and corporate travelers through points of sale in 15 countries across North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. In December 2009, Egencia expanded its footprint to nine new countries through strategic partnerships in EMEA and Asia.
Egencia provides, among other things, centralized booking tools for employees of our corporate customers, unique supply targeted at business travelers, and consolidated reporting for global, large and “SME” (Small & Medium size
Enterprise) business segments. Egencia charges its corporate clients







account management fees, as well as transactional fees for making or changing bookings. In addition, Egencia provides on-site agents to some corporate clients to more fully support the account.
Egencia has also begun offering consulting and meeting management services.

eLong.Our
majority-owned online hotel and air travel service company, based in Beijing, China, specializes in travel products and services in China. eLong uses web-based distribution technologies and a 24-hour nationwide call center to provide consumers with
the ability to make hotel reservations at more than 10,000 hotels in over 450 cities across China and more than 100 countries worldwide. eLong also offers air ticketing and other travel related information and services. Travelers can access
eLong travel products and services through its websites, including www.elong.com and www.elong.net. eLong, Inc. is a listed company, which trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol “LONG.”

Business Strategy

We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for leisure, unmanaged business or managed business travelers. We are committed to providing travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers the
world over with the best set of resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging Expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio, technology and content innovation, global reach and breadth of product offering. In addition, we
intelligently utilize our growing base of knowledge about destinations, activities, suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.We seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers, suppliers and
advertisers through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target several different demographics, from the value-conscious traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a high-touch, customized vacation package through our
Classic Vacations brand.

We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive
product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content about lodging properties, such
as 360 degree tours and hotel reviews. In the United States, hotels.com generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations, and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the
telephone.

Through Egencia, we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in North
America, Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Further, the TripAdvisor Media Network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and user-generated content.

We believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models, enabling them
to offer their products and services to the industry’s broadest range of travelers using our various agency, merchant and advertising business models. We intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio, geographic footprint
and business models for the benefit of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers.

Technology and Content
Innovation.Expedia has an established tradition of technology innovation, from Expedia.com’s inception as a division of Microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as Expedia’s introduction of
its “Expedia Easy Manage” program, offering smaller properties in secondary and tertiary markets in Europe and Asia Pacific through an agency model hotel program, Media Solutions introduction of rich media display ads called StorePoint
Expandables, TripAdvisor’s launch of its Family Vacation Critic, which offers reviews of kid-friendly and parent-tested hotels, resorts, attractions and destinations to help parents select the best family vacation, and FlipKey’s launch of
self-service listings for vacation property owners to merchandise their offerings.

We intend to continue innovating on behalf
of our travelers, suppliers and advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience, supplier integration and presentation, platform improvements, search engine marketing and search engine optimization.







Global Reach.Our Expedia, hotels.com and TripAdvisor Media
Network brands operate both in North America and internationally. We also offer Chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in eLong and through our TripAdvisor brands daodao.com and kuxun.cn, and we offer
hotels to European-based travelers through our wholly-owned subsidiary Venere, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, approximately 34% of our worldwide gross bookings and 37% of worldwide revenue were international.

Egencia, our corporate travel business, operates in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and the Asia Pacific region using direct
points of sale as well as strategic partnerships. We believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and
improve their employees’ travel experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of Egencia.

In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of Expedia.com
in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings, as well as
proprietary and user-generated content for travelers.

Our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we
introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers. As an example, our traveler review feature — whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of
reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites. In addition, our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and non-travel advertisers.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale. We anticipate launching points of sale in additional
countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce. Future launches may occur under any of our brands, or through acquisition of third-party brands, as in the case of eLong, Venere, Kuxun and Egencia.

Breadth of Product Offering.We offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our
travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time. Travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer, including via our 24/7 1-800 telesales service, which is
an integral part of the Company’s appeal to travelers.

Over 60% of our revenue comes from transactions involving the
booking of hotel reservations, with less than 15% of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets. We facilitate travel products and services either as stand-alone products or as part of package transactions. We have emphasized
growing our merchant hotel and package businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction; however, we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our Venere brand as well as our Expedia and hotels.com brands. We also seek
to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental, destination services, cruise and other product offerings. We have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and
media revenue from both the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as increased advertising revenue from our worldwide websites, such as Expedia.com and hotels.com, which have historically been focused on transaction revenue. In 2009,
advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 11% of worldwide revenue.

Merchant and Agency Business Models

We make travel products and services available both on a stand-alone and package basis, primarily through two business
models: the merchant model and the agency model. Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking of hotel rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and for such bookings, we are the merchant of record.
Under the agency model, we act as an agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by our travelers to the relevant airline, hotel, car rental company or cruise line.







As merchant of record, we generally have certain latitude to establish prices charged to
travelers (as compared to agency transactions). Also, we generally negotiate supply allocation and pricing with our suppliers, which enables us to achieve a higher level of net revenue per transaction as compared to that provided through the agency
model.

Through our Expedia-branded websites, travelers can dynamically assemble multiple component travel packages in a single
transaction at a lower price as compared to booking each component separately. Packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on these websites include a merchant hotel component and an air or car component. Travelers select packages
based on the total package price, without being provided component pricing. The use of the merchant travel components in packages enables us to make certain travel products available at prices lower than those charged on an individual component
basis by travel suppliers without impacting their established pricing and position models. We are also expanding our use of third-party provided pre-assembled package offerings, particularly through our international points of sale, further
broadening our scope of products and services to travelers.

Our agency business is comprised of the sale of airline tickets,
hotel, cruise and car rental reservations. Airline ticket transactions currently make up the majority of this business. In the third quarter of 2008, we acquired Venere, an agency-based online hotel business in Europe and since then have launched
Expedia Easy Manage, which is our agency hotel offer for small hotels and hotels in secondary or tertiary cities. Although net revenue per transaction is lower compared to the merchant model, due to the high volume of airline tickets sold our agency
gross bookings accounted for 58% of total gross bookings for the year ended December 31, 2009.

Relationships with
Travel Suppliers, Distribution and Fulfillment Partners

Overview.We make travel
products and services available from a variety of large and small commercial and charter airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, cruise lines and destination service providers. We seek to build and maintain long-term, strategic
relationships with travel suppliers and global distribution system (“GDS”) partners. An important component of the success of our business depends on our ability to maintain our existing, as well as build new, relationships with travel
suppliers and GDS partners.

Travel Suppliers.We strive to deliver value to our travel suppliers
through a wide range of innovative, targeted merchandising and promotional strategies designed to increase their revenue, while simultaneously reducing their marketing transaction and customer service costs. Our Partner Services Group consists
mainly of strategic account managers and local market managers who work directly with travel suppliers to increase the marketing of their travel products and brands through our points of sale, including participation in our seasonal and event-driven
promotions.

In addition, we have developed proprietary, supplier-oriented technology that streamlines the interaction between
some of our websites and hotel central reservation systems, making it easier and more cost-effective for hotels to manage reservations made through our brands. Through this “direct connect” technology, hotels can upload information about
available products and services and rates directly from their central reservation systems into our websites, as well as automatically confirm hotel reservations made by our travelers. In the absence of direct connect technology, both of these
processes are generally completed manually via a proprietary extranet. Our travelers can now book reservations with over 64,000 merchant hotel properties worldwide, of which approximately 56% are now fully direct-connected.

Distribution Partners.GDSs, also referred to as computer reservation services, provide a centralized,
comprehensive repository of travel suppliers “content” — such as availability and pricing of seats on various airline point-to-point flights, or “segments.” The GDSs act as intermediaries between the travel suppliers
and travel agencies, allowing agents to reserve and book flights, rooms or other travel products.

We use Sabre and Amadeus as
our primary GDS segment providers. Prior to 2007, we primarily used Worldspan. We added the additional GDSs in order to ensure the widest possible supply of air content for our travelers.







Fulfillment Partners.We outsource a portion of our airline
ticket fulfillment functions to third-party suppliers. Such functions include the issuance of airline tickets and related customer services.

Marketing and Promotions

Our marketing programs are intended to
build and maintain the value of our various brands, drive traffic and conversion through our various brands and businesses, optimize ongoing traveler acquisition costs and strategically position our brands in relation to one another. Our long-term
success and profitability depends on our continued ability to maintain and increase the overall number of traveler transactions in a cost-effective manner.

Our marketing channels primarily include online advertising including search engine marketing and optimization, offline advertising, direct and/or personalized traveler communications on our websites as
well as through direct e-mail communication with our travelers. Our marketing programs and initiatives include promotional offers such as coupons as well as seasonal or periodic special offers from our travel suppliers based on our supplier
relationships. In addition, we offer several traveler loyalty programs to our worldwide travelers, including the ThankYou Rewards on Expedia.com, welcomerewards on hotels.com and Nectar in the United Kingdom.

We also make use of affiliate marketing. The Expedia.com and hotels.com-branded websites receive bookings from consumers who have
clicked-through to the respective websites through links posted on affiliate partner websites. We have agreements with thousands of third-party affiliate partners, including a number of leading travel companies, pursuant to which we pay a commission
for bookings originated from their websites. Affiliate partners can make travel products and services available through an Expedia-branded website, a co-branded website or their own private label website. We also provide our affiliates with
technology and access to a wide range of products and services.

Operations and Technology

We provide 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week traveler support by telephone or via e-mail. For purposes of operational flexibility, we provide
this support infrastructure with a combination of outsourced and in-house call centers, which are located in various locations throughout the world, including extensive outsourced operations in the Philippines and El Salvador. We have made
significant investments in our call center technologies in 2008 and 2009 and have plans to continue these investments going forward.

Our systems infrastructure and web and database servers are housed in various locations, mainly in the United States, which have communication links as well as 24-hour monitoring and engineering support. The web hosting facilities have
their own generators and multiple back-up systems. Significant amounts of our owned computer hardware for operating the websites are located at these facilities. For some critical systems, we have both production and disaster-recovery facilities.

We have developed innovative technology to power our global travel marketplace. For example, our Best Fare Search technology
essentially deconstructs segment feeds in the United States from GDS partners for air flight searches and recommends the best way to re-assemble multi-leg itineraries so that they are less expensive and more flexible for the traveler. We are looking
to expand this technology internationally. We are also investing in improving our fare discovery technologies and user interfaces to provide more comprehensive and easier discovery of competitive rates for our travelers.

We continue to invest in our operations and technology infrastructure, and we anticipate additional traveler-facing benefits in 2010.

Competition

Our brands compete in rapidly evolving and intensely competitive markets. We believe the relatively low percentage of total travel sales transacted online, particularly in international markets, indicates
that these







markets represent especially large opportunities for Expedia and those of its competitors that wish to expand their brands and businesses abroad.

Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers
including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, search engines and travel meta-search engines. We face these competitors in local,
regional, national and/or international markets. In some cases, competitors are offering favorable terms and improved interfaces to suppliers and travelers which make competition increasingly difficult.

We believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands is a critical component of our effort to compete. We differentiate our brands from our
competitors primarily based on quality and breadth of travel products, channel features and usability, price or promotional offers, traveler service and quality of travel planning content and advice. The emphasis on one or more of these factors
varies, depending on the brand or business and the related target demographic.

Our brands face increasing competition from
travel supplier direct websites. In some cases, supplier direct channels offer advantages to travelers, such as long standing loyalty programs, no transaction fees and better pricing. Our websites feature travel products and services from numerous
travel suppliers (as opposed to a single supplier), and allow travelers to combine products and services from multiple providers in one transaction. We face competition from airlines, hotels, rental car companies, cruise operators and other travel
service providers, whether working individually or collectively, some of which are suppliers to our websites. Our business is generally sensitive to changes in the competitive landscape, including the emergence of new competitors or business models,
and supplier consolidation.

Intellectual Property Rights

We regard our intellectual property rights, including our patents, service marks, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property, as critical to our success. For
example, we rely heavily upon the software code, informational databases and other components that make up our travel planning service.

We rely on a combination of laws, business practices and contractual obligations with employees, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our trade secrets. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third-party to
copy or otherwise obtain and use our trade secrets or our intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require the uncertainty of legal action to correct. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not
independently and lawfully develop substantially similar properties.

We maintain our trademark portfolio by filing trademark
applications with the appropriate international trademark offices, maintaining our current registrations, securing contractual trademark rights when appropriate, and relying on common law trademark rights when appropriate. We also register domain
names as we deem appropriate. We protect our trademarks and domain names with an enforcement program and use of trademark licenses. While we seek to protect our trademarks and domain names, effective trademark and domain name protection may not be
available or may not be sought by us for every trademark and domain name used in every country, and contractual disputes may affect the use of trademarks and domain names governed by private contract. In addition, our infringement monitoring
resources may not locate every trademark or domain name infringement that exists. Similarly, not every variation of a domain name may be available, or may be registered by us, even if available. The failure to protect our intellectual property in a
meaningful manner, or challenges to our intellectual property rights, could materially adversely affect our business, result in erosion of our brand names and/or limit our ability to control marketing on or through the internet using our various
domain names.

We have considered, and will continue to consider, the appropriateness of filing for patents to protect future
inventions, as circumstances may warrant. However, many patents protect only specific inventions and there can be no assurance that others may not create new products or methods that achieve similar results without infringing upon patents owned by
us.







From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course
of our business, including claims of alleged infringement by us of the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third-parties. In addition, litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual
property rights, protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any such litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and
technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business.

Regulation

We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the travel industry and the provision of travel services, including registration in
various states as “sellers of travel” and compliance with certain disclosure requirements and participation in state restitution funds. In addition, our businesses are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation and
must comply with various rules and regulations governing the provision of air transportation, including those relating to advertising and accessibility.

As we continue to expand the reach of our brands into the European, Asia-Pacific and other international markets, we are increasingly subject to laws and regulations applicable to travel agents in those
markets, including, in some countries, laws regulating the provision of travel packages and industry specific value-added tax regimes. For example, the European Economic Community Council Directive on Package Travel Package Holidays and Package
Tours imposes various obligations upon marketers of travel packages, such as disclosure obligations to consumers and liability to consumers for improper performance of the package, including supplier failure.

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

We generate our revenue through a diverse customer base, and there is no reliance on a single customer or small group of customers; no customer represented 10% or more of our total revenue in the periods
presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we have three reportable segments:
Leisure, the TripAdvisor Media Network and Egencia. The change from two reportable segments, North America and Europe, was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands. The segment and geographic information required
herein is contained in Note 16 — Segment Information, in the notes to our consolidated financial statements

Additional
Information

Company Website and Public Filings.We maintain a corporate website at
www.expediainc.com. Except as explicitly noted, the information on our website, as well as the websites of our various brands and businesses, is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or in any other filings with, or
in any information furnished or submitted to, the SEC.

We make available, free of charge through our website, our Annual
Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Sections 13(a) or Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, as soon as reasonably practicable after they have been electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

Code
of Ethics.We post our code of business conduct and ethics, which applies to all employees, including all executive officers, senior financial officers and directors, on our corporate website at www.expediainc.com. Our
code of business conduct and ethics complies with Item 406 of SEC Regulation S-K and the rules of NASDAQ. We intend to disclose any changes to the code that affect the provisions required by Item 406 of Regulation S-K, and any
waivers of the code of ethics for our executive officers, senior financial officers or directors, on our corporate website.







Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately 7,960 full-time and part-time employees, including approximately 1,770 employees of eLong. We believe we have good relationships with our
employees, including relationships with employees represented by works councils or other similar organizations.

Part I. Item 1A.Risk Factors

You should carefully consider each of the following risks and uncertainties associated with our company and the ownership of our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
may also impair our business and/or financial performance.

We operate in an increasingly competitive global environment.

The market for the services we offer is increasingly and intensely competitive. We compete with both established and
emerging online and traditional sellers of travel-related services, including online travel agencies, travel suppliers, large online portal and search companies, traditional travel agencies, metasearch companies and operators of travel industry
reservation databases. Some of our competitors, particularly travel suppliers such as airlines and hotels, may offer products and services on more favorable terms, including lower prices, no fees or unique access to proprietary loyalty programs,
such as points and miles. Many of these competitors, such as airlines, hotel and rental car companies, have been steadily focusing on increasing online demand on their own websites in lieu of third-party distributors such as the various Expedia
sites. For instance, some low cost airlines, which are having increasing success in the marketplace, distribute their online supply exclusively through their own websites. Suppliers who sell on their own websites, in some instances, offer advantages
such as increased or exclusive product availability and their own bonus miles or loyalty points, which could make their offerings more attractive to consumers than ours.

In addition, we face increasing competition from other online travel agencies, such as priceline.com, Travelocity and Orbitz, which in some cases may have more favorable offerings for both travelers and
suppliers, including pricing, connectivity and supply breadth. In particular, we have faced and are facing intense competition in Europe from Booking.com, a subsidiary of Priceline. We also compete with other travel agencies for both travelers and
the acquisition and retention of supply. Increasing competition from current and emerging competitors, the introduction of new technologies and the expansion of existing technologies, such as metasearch and other search engine technologies, may
force us to make changes to our business models, which could affect our financial performance and liquidity. Increased competition has resulted in and may continue to result in reduced margins, as well as loss of travelers, transactions and brand
recognition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current, emerging and future competitors or provide differentiated products and services to our traveler base.

Global economic conditions have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

Travel expenditures are sensitive to personal and business discretionary spending levels and tend to decline or grow more slowly during
economic downturns, including downturns in any of our major markets. In late 2008 and 2009, there was a rapid deterioration of domestic and global economic conditions, and the outlook for 2010 is uncertain. This slowing of the domestic and global
economies has increased unemployment and reduced the financial capacity of both corporate and leisure travelers, thereby slowed spending on the services we provide, particularly in the first half of 2009. We cannot predict the magnitude, length or
recurrence of the recessionary economic patterns. However, the continuation, or worsening, of domestic and global economic conditions could continue to adversely affect our business and financial performance.

Declines or disruptions in the travel industry could adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance are affected by the health of the worldwide travel industry, including by decreases in hotel occupancy
rates, hotel average daily rates, decreases in airline capacity or







Our business
depends on our relationships with travel suppliers and travel supplier intermediaries.

We rely on the value of our brands, and the costs of maintaining and enhancing our brand awareness are increasing.

We believe continued investment in our brands, including Expedia, hotels.com, Hotwire, Classic Vacations, Egencia, eLong, Venere, the
TripAdvisor Media Network and Expedia Local Expert, is critical to retaining and expanding our traveler, supplier and advertiser bases. We have and expect to continue having to spend more to maintain our brands’ value due to a variety of
factors. These include increased spending from our competitors, the increasing costs of supporting multiple brands, expansion into geographies and products where our brands are less well known, inflation in media pricing including search engine
keywords and the continued emergence and relative traffic share growth of search engines and metasearch engines as destination sites for travelers. We have spent considerable financial and human resources to date on the establishment and maintenance
of our brands, and we will continue to invest in, and devote resources to, advertising and marketing, as well as other brand building efforts to preserve and enhance consumer awareness of our brands. We may not be able to successfully







maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands, and, even if we are successful in our branding efforts, such efforts may not be cost-effective, or as cost-effective as they have been
historically. If we are unable to maintain or enhance consumer awareness of our brands and generate demand in a cost-effective manner, it would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

Our business could be negatively affected by changes in search engine algorithms and dynamics, or search engine disintermediation.

We increasingly utilize internet search engines such as Google, principally through the purchase of travel-related keywords,
to generate traffic to our websites. Search engines, including Google, frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user’s search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to
our websites can be negatively affected. In addition, a significant amount of traffic is directed to our websites through our participation in pay-per-click and display advertising campaigns on internet media properties and search engines whose
pricing and operating dynamics can experience rapid change, both technically and competitively. If a major search engine changes its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects the search engine ranking, paid or unpaid, of our websites or that of
our third-party distribution partners, or if competitive dynamics further impact market pricing in a negative manner, our business and financial performance would be adversely affected. In addition, to the extent Google, Bing and other leading
search engines attempt to more directly appeal to travel consumers by maintaining transactions within their own websites or referring those leads to suppliers directly, that could have a meaningfully adverse impact on our business and financial
performance.

We rely on information technology to operate our businesses and maintain our competitiveness, and any failure
to adapt to technological developments or industry trends could harm our business.

We depend on the use of sophisticated
information technologies and systems, including technology and systems used for reservations, communications, procurement and administration. As our operations grow in both size and scope, we must continuously improve and upgrade our systems and
infrastructure to offer an increasing number of travelers enhanced products, services, features and functionality, while maintaining the reliability and integrity of our systems and infrastructure. Our future success also depends on our ability to
adapt our services and infrastructure to meet rapidly evolving consumer trends and demands while continuing to improve the performance, features and reliability of our service in response to competitive service and product offerings. New
developments in areas, such as cloud computing, could also make it easier for competition to enter our markets due to lower up-front technology costs.

In addition, we may not be able to maintain our existing systems or replace or introduce new technologies and systems as quickly as we would like or in a cost-effective manner. We have been engaged in a
multi-year effort, which we expect to continue for several years, to migrate portions of our site functionality to new technology platforms to enable us to introduce innovation more rapidly, achieve better search engine optimization and improve our
site merchandising capabilities, among other anticipated benefits. These migrations have been more time consuming and expensive than originally anticipated, and the resources devoted to those efforts have adversely affected our ability to develop
new site innovations. Continued delays or difficulties in implementing new or enhanced systems may keep us from achieving the desired results in a timely manner, to the extent anticipated, or at all. In addition, during the migration process the
sites may experience reduced functionality and decreases in conversion rates. Also, we may be unable to devote financial resources to new technologies and systems in the future. If any of these events occur, our business and financial performance
could suffer.

We rely on third-parties for many systems and services.

We rely on third-party service providers for certain customer care, fulfillment, processing, systems development, technology and other
services. If these third-parties experience difficulty meeting our requirements or standards, it could damage our reputation or make it difficult for us to operate some aspects of our business. In addition, if such third-party service providers were
to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, face financial distress or other business disruption, we could suffer increased costs and delays in our ability to provide similar services until an equivalent service provider could be found or we
could develop replacement technology or operations. In addition, we rely increasingly on outsourced providers of traveler care and information







technology services. If we are unsuccessful in choosing high quality partners or we ineffectively manage these partners, it could have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance.

We rely on the performance of highly skilled personnel and, if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire,
retain and motivate qualified personnel, our business would be harmed.

Our performance is largely dependent on the talents
and efforts of highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. In particular, the contributions of Barry
Diller, our Chairman and Senior Executive, and Dara Khosrowshahi, our Chief Executive Officer, are critical to the overall management of the company. Our future success will depend on the performance of our senior management and key employees.
Expedia cannot ensure that it will be able to retain the services of Mr. Diller, Mr. Khosrowshahi or any other member of our senior management or key employees, the loss of whom could seriously harm our business. Competition for
well-qualified employees in certain aspects of our business, including software engineers, developers and other technology professionals, also remains intense.

Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees
or retaining or motivating existing employees, our business would be adversely affected. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies.

We are continuing the process of restructuring portions of our global workforce to simplify and streamline our organization, improve our cost structure and strengthen our overall businesses. These changes
could affect employee morale and productivity and be disruptive to our business and financial performance.

Our stock price
is highly volatile.

The market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could continue to be subject to wide
fluctuations in response to factors such as the following, some of which are beyond our control:



•Quarterly variations in our operating results;



•Operating results that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;



•Changes in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;



•Rating agency credit rating actions;



•Reaction to our earnings releases and conference calls, or presentations by executives at investor and industry conferences;



•Changes in our capital structure;



•Changes in market valuations of other internet or online service companies;



•Announcements of dividends or changes in the amount or frequency of our dividends;



•Announcements of technological innovations or new services by us or our competitors;



•Announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;



•Loss of a major travel supplier, such as an airline or hotel chain;



•Changes in the status of our intellectual property rights;



•Lack of success in the expansion of our business model geographically;



•Announcements by third parties of significant claims or proceedings against us or adverse developments in pending proceedings;



•Additions or departures of key personnel;







•Rumors or public speculation about any of the above factors; and



•Market and volume fluctuations in the stock markets in general.

Volatility in our stock price could also make us less attractive to certain investors, and/or invite speculative trading in our common stock
or debt instruments.

Our international operations involve additional risks and our exposure to these risks will increase as
we expand our international operations.

We operate in a number of jurisdictions outside of the United States and intend to
continue to expand our international presence. To achieve widespread acceptance in the countries and markets we enter, we must continue to tailor our services and business model to the unique circumstances of such countries and markets, including
travel supplier relationships and traveler preferences. Learning the customs and cultures of various countries, particularly with respect to travel patterns and practices, can be difficult, costly and divert management and personnel resources. Our
failure to adapt our practices and models effectively to the traveler and supplier preferences of each country into which we expand could slow our international growth.

We expect to continue to face additional risks in international operations. These risks include:



•Political instability;



•Threatened or actual acts of terrorism;



•Regulatory requirements, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, data privacy requirements, labor laws and anti-competition regulations;



•Our ability to comply with additional U.S. laws applicable to U.S. companies operating internationally as well as local laws and regulations;



•Diminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights;



•Increased risk and limits on our ability to enforce intellectual property rights;



•Possible preferences by local populations for local providers;



•Restrictions on the withdrawal of non-U.S. investment and earnings;



•Currency exchange restrictions;



•Restrictions on our ability to repatriate cash as well as restrictions on our ability to invest in our operations in certain countries;



•Exchange rate fluctuations;



•Financial risk arising from transactions in multiple currencies, including our failure to adequately manage those risks;



•Slower adoption of the internet as an advertising, broadcast and commerce medium in those markets as compared to the United States; and



•Difficulties in managing staffing and operations due to distance, time zones, language and cultural differences.

Changing laws, rules and regulations and legal uncertainties may adversely affect our business or financial performance.

Our business and financial performance could be adversely affected by unfavorable changes in or interpretations of existing, or the
promulgation of new laws, rules and regulations applicable to us and our businesses, including those relating to the internet and online commerce, consumer protection and privacy. Such unfavorable changes could decrease demand for products and
services, increase costs and/or subject us to additional liabilities. For example, there is, and will likely continue to be, an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet and online commerce, which may relate to liability
for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet, user privacy, taxation and the quality of products and services.







Furthermore, the growth and development of online commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on online businesses generally.

Adverse application of tax laws, rules or regulations could have an adverse effect on our business and financial
performance.

The application of various domestic and international sales, use, occupancy, value-added and other tax laws,
rules and regulations to our historical and new products and services is subject to interpretation by the applicable taxing authorities. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of
the internet and e-commerce. If the tax laws, rules and regulations were amended, if new adverse laws, rules or regulations were adopted, or if current laws are interpreted adversely to our interests, particularly with respect to occupancy or
value-added taxes, the results could increase our tax payments (prospectively or retrospectively) and/or subject us to penalties and decrease the demand for our products and services if we pass on such costs to the consumer. As a result, these
changes could have an adverse affect on our businesses or financial performance.

Tax authorities have brought lawsuits and
have levied assessments asserting that we are required to collect and remit occupancy taxes. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be required in certain jurisdictions to pay tax assessments, which may be substantial, prior to
contesting the validity of such assessments. This requirement is commonly referred to as “pay-to-play.” Payment of these amounts is not an admission that the taxpayer believes it is subject to such taxes. We continue to work with relevant
tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under existing, new and emerging laws and regulations. There have been, and will continue to be, substantial ongoing costs, which may include “pay-to-play” payments, associated
with complying with, and defending our position regarding, the various indirect tax requirements in the numerous markets in which we conduct or will conduct business.

We are involved in various legal proceedings and may experience unfavorable outcomes, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

We are involved in various legal proceedings, including, but not limited to, the legal proceedings described in discussed in Part I,
Item 3, Legal Proceedings, that involve claims for substantial amounts of money or for other relief or that might necessitate changes to our business or operations. The defense of these actions is and may continue to be both time consuming and
expensive. If these legal proceedings were to result in an unfavorable outcome, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance.

Provisions in certain credit card processing agreements could adversely affect our liquidity and financial positions.

We have agreements with companies that process customer credit card transactions for the facilitation of customer bookings of travel services from our travel suppliers. These agreements allow these
processing companies, under certain conditions, to hold an amount of our cash (referred to as a “holdback”) or require us to post a letter of credit equal to a portion of bookings that have been processed by that company. These processing
companies may be entitled to a holdback upon the occurrence of specified events, including material adverse changes in our financial condition, or for certain companies, at their discretion. An imposition of a holdback by one or more of our
processing companies could materially reduce our liquidity.

In addition, we may be held liable for accepting fraudulent credit
cards on our websites for transactions where we are merchant of record as well as other payment disputes with our customers. Additionally, we are held liable for accepting fraudulent credit cards in certain retail transactions when we do not act as
merchant of record. Accordingly, we calculate and record an allowance for the resulting credit card charge backs. If we are unable to combat the use of fraudulent credit cards on our websites, our results of operations and financial positions could
be materially adversely affected.







Our effective tax rate is impacted by a number of factors that could have a material
impact on our financial results and could increase the volatility of those results.

Due to the global nature of our
business, we are subject to income taxes in the United States and many different countries. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions
and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits could be materially different from our
historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made. In addition, there
have been proposals to amend U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. companies are taxed on foreign earnings. We are earning an increasing portion of our income in foreign countries. Although we cannot predict whether or in what
form this proposed legislation will pass, if enacted, it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.

System interruption and the lack of redundancy in our information systems may harm our businesses.

We rely on
computer systems to facilitate and process transactions. We have experienced and may in the future experience system interruptions that make some or all of these systems unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing
services to third parties. Any interruptions, outages or delays in our systems, or deterioration in their performance, could impair our ability to process transactions and decrease our quality of service that we can offer to our travelers. These
interruptions could include security intrusions and attacks on our systems for fraud or service interruption (called “denial of service” or “bot” attacks). If we were to experience frequent or persistent system failures, our
reputation and brands could be harmed.

In addition, we do not have backup systems or contingency plans for certain critical
aspects of our operations or business processes, many other systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery or business continuity planning may not be sufficient. Fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, break-ins, earthquakes,
acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer viruses, physical break-ins, electronic intrusion attempts from both external and internal sources and similar events or disruptions may damage or impact or interrupt computer or communications systems
or business processes at any time. Although we have put measures in place to protect certain portions of our facilities and assets, any of these events could cause system interruption, delays and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from
providing services to our travelers and/or third parties for a significant period of time. Remediation may be costly and we may not have adequate insurance to cover such costs. Moreover, the costs of enhancing infrastructure to attain improved
stability and redundancy may be time consuming and expensive and may require resources and expertise that are difficult to obtain.

Intense competition for advertising revenue may adversely affect our ability to achieve or maintain market share and operate profitably.







Mr. Diller currently controls Expedia. If Mr. Diller ceases to control the
company, Liberty Media Corporation may effectively control the company.

Subject to the terms of a Stockholders Agreement
between Mr. Diller and Liberty Media Corporation, Mr. Diller holds an irrevocable proxy to vote shares of Expedia stock held by Liberty. Accordingly, Mr. Diller effectively controls the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote or
for the consent of our stockholders (other than with respect to the election by the holders of common stock of 25% of the members of the Board of Directors and matters as to which Delaware law requires a separate class vote). Upon
Mr. Diller’s permanent departure from Expedia, the irrevocable proxy would terminate and depending on the capitalization of Expedia at such time, Liberty could effectively control the voting power of our capital stock. Mr. Diller,
through shares he owns beneficially as well as those subject to the irrevocable proxy, controlled approximately 59% of the combined voting power of the outstanding Expedia capital stock as of January 20, 2010.

In addition, under a Governance Agreement among Mr. Diller, Liberty Media Corporation and Expedia, Inc., as amended, each of
Mr. Diller and Liberty generally has the right to consent to limited matters in the event that we incur debt such that our ratio of total debt to EBITDA, as defined in the Governance Agreement, equals or exceeds 8:1 over a continuous 12-month
period. We cannot assure you that Mr. Diller and Liberty will consent to any such matter at a time when we are highly leveraged, in which case we would not be able to engage in such transactions or take such actions.

As a result of Mr. Diller’s ownership interests and voting power, and Liberty’s ownership interests and voting power upon
Mr. Diller’s permanent departure from us, Mr. Diller is currently, and in the future Liberty may be, in a position to control or influence significant corporate actions, including, corporate transactions such as mergers, business
combinations or dispositions of assets and determinations with respect to our significant business direction and policies. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover or other change of control
transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to us.

Actual or potential conflicts of interest may develop between Expedia
management and directors, on the one hand, and the management and directors of IAC, on the other.

Mr. Diller serves
as our Chairman of the Board of Directors and Senior Executive, while retaining his role as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of IAC, and Mr. Kaufman serves as Vice Chairman of both Expedia and IAC. The fact that Messrs. Diller and
Kaufman hold positions with both companies and own both IAC and Expedia stock could create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest for each of Messrs. Diller and Kaufman when facing decisions that may affect both IAC and Expedia.
Both Messrs. Diller and Kaufman may also face conflicts of interest with regard to the allocation of their time between IAC and Expedia.

Our certificate of incorporation provides that no officer or director of Expedia who is also an officer or director of IAC will be liable to Expedia or its stockholders for breach of any fiduciary duty by
reason of the fact that any such individual directs a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia, or does not communicate information regarding a corporate opportunity to Expedia because the officer or director has directed the corporate
opportunity to IAC. This corporate opportunity provision may have the effect of exacerbating the risk of conflicts of interest between IAC and Expedia because the provision effectively shields an overlapping director/executive officer from liability
for breach of fiduciary duty in the event that such director or officer chooses to direct a corporate opportunity to IAC instead of Expedia.

We may be unable to access capital when necessary or desirable.

The
availability of funds depends in significant measure on capital markets and liquidity factors over which we exert no control. Particularly in light of existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets, we can provide no assurance that
sufficient financing will be available on desirable or even any terms to fund investments, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or extraordinary actions or that our counterparties in any such financings would honor their contractual
commitments. In addition, any downgrade of our debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investor Service or similar ratings agencies, increases in general interest rate levels or further weakening in the credit markets could
increase our cost of capital. More recent experience suggests credit spreads can be significantly higher for companies with lower credit ratings, impacting returns for bondholders and increasing the cost of potential future debt issuances.







In addition, we have experienced, and may experience declines in seasonal liquidity and
capital provided by our merchant hotel business, which has historically provided a meaningful portion of our operating cash flow. The extent of such impact is dependent on several factors, including the rate of growth of our merchant hotel business,
payment terms with suppliers and relative growth of businesses which consume rather than generate working capital, such as our agency hotel, advertising and managed corporate travel businesses.

We have significant long-term indebtedness, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.

As of December 31, 2009, the face value of our long-term indebtedness totaled $895 million. Risks relating to our long-term
indebtedness include:



•Increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;



•Requiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flow to
fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes;



•Making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our businesses;



•Limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;



•Possible refinancing risk if certain of our senior note issues are put by holders in 2013;



•Placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt; and



•Limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or to borrow funds at rates or on other terms we find acceptable.

In addition, it is possible that we may need to incur additional indebtedness in the future in the ordinary course of business. The terms of
our credit facility and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes allow us to incur additional debt subject to certain limitations. If new debt is added to current debt levels, the risks described above could intensify.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our discretion in the operation of our business and also
require us to meet financial maintenance tests and other covenants. The failure to comply with such tests and covenants could have a material adverse effect on us.

The agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants, including those that restrict our ability to, among other things:



•Borrow money, and guarantee or provide other support for indebtedness of third parties including guarantees;



•Pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock;



•Make investments in entities that we do not control, including joint ventures;



•Enter into certain asset sale transactions, including partial or full spin-off transactions;



•Enter into secured financing arrangements;



•Enter into sale and leaseback transactions; and



•Enter into unrelated businesses.

These covenants may limit our ability to effectively operate our businesses or maximize stockholder value.

In addition, our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial tests, including an interest coverage test and a leverage ratio test.

Any failure to comply with the restrictions of our credit facility or any agreement governing our other indebtedness may result in an event
of default under those agreements. Such default may allow the creditors to







accelerate the related debt, which acceleration may trigger cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions in other debt. In addition, lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had
made to supply us with further funds (including periodic rollovers of existing borrowings).

We have foreign exchange risk.

We conduct a significant and growing portion of our business outside the United States. As a result, we face exposure to
movements in currency exchange rates, particularly those related to the British pound sterling, the euro, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar and Chinese renminbi.

These exposures include but are not limited to re-measurement gains and losses from changes in the value of foreign denominated assets and liabilities; translation gains and losses on foreign subsidiary
financial results that are translated into U.S. dollars upon consolidation; fluctuations in merchant hotel revenue due to relative currency movements from the time of booking to the time of stay; planning risk related to changes in exchange
rates between the time we prepare our annual and quarterly forecasts and when actual results occur; and the impact of relative exchange rate movements on cross-border travel, principally Europe to the United States and the United States to
Europe travel.

Depending on the size of the exposures and the relative movements of exchange rates, if we choose not to hedge
or fail to hedge effectively our exposure, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial statements and financial condition. As we have seen in some recent periods, in the event of severe volatility in exchange rates these exposures
can increase, and the impact on our results of operations can be more pronounced. In addition, the current environment, and the increasingly global nature of our business has made hedging these exposures both more complex and costly. We have
increased and plan to continue increasing the scope, complexity and duration of our foreign exchange risk management, including the use of forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposures. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging
activities including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater
volatility as a result of our hedging activities.

We are exposed to various counterparty risks.

We are exposed to the risk of failure to perform by various financial counterparties, including for our insurance coverages, investments,
bank deposits, letters of credit and foreign exchange risk management. As it relates to foreign exchange, we employ forward contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. As of December 31, 2009, we
were party to forward contracts with a notional value of $136 million and the fair value of which was approximately $250,000. The counterparties to these contracts were JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, RBS, Banc of America, U.S. Bank, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, HSBC and BNP Paribas. Upon the maturity of these or subsequent contracts, the counterparties are potentially obligated to pay us net settlement values. If any of these counterparties were to liquidate, declare bankruptcy or
otherwise cease operations, it may not be able to satisfy its obligations under these forward contracts. In addition, due to the weakening economy we also face increased credit risk and payment delays from our non-financial contract counterparties.

Our investments in China create risks and uncertainties relating to the laws in China.

We have two principal businesses operating in China: eLong, an online transactional travel business; and TripAdvisor China, which operates a
media site under the brand daodao.com and a metasearch site under the brand Kuxun. The success of these businesses and any future investments we make in China are subject to risks and uncertainties regarding the application, development and
interpretation of China’s laws and regulations. Significant uncertainties exist in the interpretation and enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations including requirements to permits and licenses, and such uncertainties could limit the
available legal protections relating to our investments. Moreover, we cannot predict the effect of future developments in China’s legal system, particularly with respect to the travel industry, the internet, media, foreign investment, taxation,
labor, and currency exchange and regulation, including the introduction of new laws, changes to existing laws or the interpretation or enforcement of current or future laws and regulations. In addition, the laws and regulations of







China restrict foreign investment in areas including the air-ticketing, travel agency, internet content provision, mobile communication and related businesses. Although we have established
effective control through a series of agreements between the companies in which our Chinese investments are held and their affiliated Chinese entities, future developments in the interpretation or enforcement of Chinese laws and regulations or a
dispute relating to these agreements could restrict our ability to operate or restructure these entities or to engage in strategic transactions. Finally, China does not have treaties with the United States or most other western countries
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts. As a result, court judgments obtained in jurisdictions with which China does not have treaties on reciprocal recognition of judgment may be difficult or impossible to
enforce in China.

Our processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result
of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements, differing views of personal privacy rights, or data security breaches.

In the processing of our traveler transactions, we receive and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and we rely on information collected online for purposes of advertising to visitors to our websites. This information
is increasingly subject to legislation, regulations and industry policies in numerous jurisdictions around the world. These requirements and restrictions are not necessarily consistently applied. This government and industry action is typically
intended to protect the privacy and security of information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. We could be adversely affected if legislation, regulations or other requirements are expanded to require
changes in our current business practices or if governing jurisdictions or industry groups interpret or implement their requirements in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. As privacy and data
protection have become more sensitive issues for regulators and consumers, we may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the protections that should apply to travel and/or online data.

We cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent data breaches. In addition, certain of our acquired companies may not have the
same standards related to data collection, storage and transfer that Expedia has historically maintained. Failure to improve their standards or a substantial data breach in any of our businesses could significantly harm our business, damage our
reputation, expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability and/or cause customers and potential customers to lose confidence in our security, which would have a negative effect on the value of our brands.

These and other privacy and security developments that are difficult to anticipate could adversely affect our business and financial
performance.

Acquisitions could result in operating and financial difficulties.

Our future growth may depend, in part, on acquisitions. To the extent that we grow through acquisitions, we will face the operational and
financial risks that commonly accompany that strategy. We would also face operational risks, such as failing to assimilate the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses, disrupting their ongoing businesses, increased complexity of our
business, impairing management resources and their relationships with employees and travelers as a result of changes in their ownership and management. Further, the evaluation and negotiation of potential acquisitions, as well as the integration of
an acquired business, may divert management time and other resources. Some acquisitions may not be successful and their performance may result in the impairment of their carrying value.

Certain financial and operational risks related to acquisitions that may have a material impact on our business are:



•Use of cash resources and incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities in funding acquisitions may limit other potential uses of our cash, including
stock repurchases, dividend payments and retirement of outstanding indebtedness;



•Amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets and other adverse accounting consequences;



•Costs incurred in identifying and performing due diligence on potential acquisition targets that may or may not be successful;







•Difficulties and expenses in assimilating the operations, products, technology, privacy protection systems, information systems or personnel of the
acquired company;



•Impairment of relationships with employees, suppliers and affiliates of our business and the acquired business;



•The assumption of known and unknown debt and liabilities of the acquired company;



•Failure to generate adequate returns on our acquisitions and investments;



•Entrance into markets in which we have no direct prior experience; and



•Impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets arising from our acquisitions.

We cannot be sure that our intellectual property is protected from copying or use by others, including potential competitors.

Our websites rely on content and technology intellectual property, much of which we regard as proprietary. We protect our
proprietary technology by relying on trademarks, copyrights, trade secret laws, patents and confidentiality agreements. In connection with our license agreements with third parties, we seek to control access to and distribution of our technology,
documentation and other proprietary information. Even with all of these precautions, it is possible for someone else to copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technology or content without our authorization or to develop similar technology
independently. Effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our services are made available through the internet, and policing unauthorized use of our proprietary information is
difficult and expensive. We cannot be sure that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our proprietary information. This misappropriation could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the future, we may need to go to
court to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. This litigation might result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management
attention.

We currently license from third parties some of the technologies incorporated into our websites. As we continue to
introduce new services that incorporate new technologies, we may be required to license additional technology. We cannot be sure that such technology licenses will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Part I. Item 3.Legal
Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, Expedia and its subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings
and claims involving property, personal injury, contract, alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property rights and other claims. The amounts that may be recovered in such matters may be subject to insurance coverage.

Rules of the SEC require the description of material pending legal proceedings, other than ordinary, routine litigation incident to the
registrant’s business, and advise that proceedings ordinarily need not be described if they primarily involve damages claims for amounts (exclusive of interest and costs) not individually exceeding 10% of the current assets of the registrant
and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. In the judgment of management, none of the pending litigation matters that the Company and its subsidiaries are defending, including those described below, involves or is likely to involve amounts of
that magnitude. The litigation matters described below involve issues or claims that may be of particular interest to our stockholders, regardless of whether any of these matters may be material to our financial position or results of operations
based upon the standard set forth in the SEC’s rules.

Securities Class Action Litigation against IAC

Beginning on September 20, 2004, twelve purported shareholder class actions were commenced in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York against IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”) and certain of its officers and directors, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. These cases arose out of IAC’s August 4, 2004 announcement of its
earnings for the second quarter of 2004 and generally alleged that the value of IAC’s stock was artificially inflated by pre-announcement statements about its financial results and forecasts that were false and misleading due to the
defendants’ alleged failure to disclose various problems faced by IAC’s travel businesses. On December 20, 2004, the district court consolidated the twelve lawsuits, appointed co-lead plaintiffs, and designated co-lead
plaintiffs’ counsel. SeeIn re IAC/InterActiveCorp Securities Litigation,No. 04-CV-7447 (S.D.N.Y.). Expedia is not a party to this litigation, however, under the terms of its Separation Agreement with IAC, Expedia has generally
agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities, if any, associated with any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the spin-off of Expedia from IAC (the “Spin-Off”) of the businesses or entities that comprise Expedia
following the Spin-Off.

On October 18, 2004, a related shareholder derivative action,Stuart Garber, Derivatively on
Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al., No. 04-603416, was commenced in the Supreme Court of the State of New York (New York County) against certain of IAC’s officers and directors. On November 15, 2004, another
related shareholder derivative action,Lisa Butler, Derivatively on Behalf of IAC/InterActiveCorp v. Barry Diller et al., No. 04-CV-9067, was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against
certain of IAC’s current and former directors. On January 24, 2005, the federal district court consolidated theButlercase with the securities class action for pre-trial purposes only. On April 11, 2005, the district court
issued a similar consolidation order in respect of theGarbercase.

On July 5, 2005, the plaintiffs in the related
shareholder suits filed a consolidated shareholder derivative complaint against IAC (as a nominal defendant) and sixteen current or former officers or directors of IAC or its former travel business. The complaint, which is based upon factual
allegations similar to those in the securities class action, purports to assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, abuse of control, gross mismanagement, waste of corporate assets, unjust enrichment, violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange
Act, and contribution and indemnification. The complaint sought an order voiding the election of IAC’s then Board of Directors, as well as damages in an unspecified amount, various forms of equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement of
remuneration received by the individual defendants from IAC.

On September 15, 2005, IAC and the other defendants filed
motions to dismiss both the securities class action and the shareholder derivative suits. On November 30, 2005, the plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motions. On January 6, 2006, the defendants filed reply papers in further support
of the motions. The court issued an opinion and order (i) granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint in the securities class action, with leave to replead, and (ii) granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss the
complaint in the shareholder derivative suits, with prejudice.







On April 23, 2007, the plaintiffs in the shareholder derivative suits filed a notice of
appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from the District Court’s order of dismissal. On June 14, 2007, on consent of the parties, the appeal was withdrawn from active consideration by the Court of Appeals,
subject to reinstatement by no later than March 31, 2008.

On May 15, 2007, the plaintiffs in the securities class
action filed a second amended complaint. The new pleading continues to allege that the defendants failed to disclose material information concerning problems at the Company’s then-travel businesses and to assert the same legal claims as its
predecessor. On August 15, 2007, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. A hearing on the motion has not been scheduled.

Expedia believes that the claims in the class action and derivative suits lack merit and will continue to vigorously defend against them.

hotels.com.On May 6, 2003, a purported class action was filed in Texas state court against hotels.com,
L.P. (“hotels.com”), Mary Canales, Individually and on Behalf of All Others Similarly Situated v. hotels.com, L.P., No. DC-03-162 (District Court, 229th Judicial District, Duval County). The complaint, as amended, alleges that hotels.com
breached its contract with its customers by charging customers “taxes” that exceed the amount required by or paid to the applicable taxing authorities and by charging customers “fees” that do not correspond to any specific
services provided. On April 29, 2005, the court issued an order granting the plaintiff’s motion for class certification. On February 1, 2006, the court of appeals reversed the holding certifying the class and remanded the case to the
trial court. On April 20, 2006, Canales filed a fourth amended petition and a new motion for class certification. On June 23, 2009, plaintiff filed an amended class action petition. Plaintiff filed an amended motion to certify a class on
September 18, 2009. Defendant filed a motion for summary judgment on September 18, 2009. Plaintiff filed a response and cross-moved for summary judgment on October 22, 2009. These motions remain pending.

Part II. Item 7.Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations

Overview

Expedia, Inc. is an online travel company, empowering business and leisure travelers with the tools and information they need to efficiently
research, plan, book and experience travel. We have created a global travel marketplace used by a broad range of leisure and corporate travelers, offline retail travel agents and travel service providers. We make available, on a stand-alone and
package basis, travel products and services provided by numerous airlines, lodging properties, car rental companies, destination service providers, cruise lines and other travel product and service companies. We also offer travel and non-travel
advertisers access to a potential source







of incremental traffic and transactions through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction-based websites. For additional information
about our portfolio of brands, see the disclosure set forth in Part I, Item 1, Business, under the caption “Management Overview.”

All percentages within this section are calculated on actual, unrounded numbers.

Trends

The travel industry, including offline agencies, online agencies and suppliers of travel
products and services, has been characterized by intense competition, as well as rapid and significant change. In addition, beginning in late 2008, global economic and financial market conditions worsened markedly, creating uncertainty for travelers
and suppliers. This macroeconomic downturn has pressured discretionary spending on travel and advertising, with initial weakness in the United States and the United Kingdom markets increasing and spreading to all geographies. Although recent
macroeconomic trends have been generally stable to slightly improving, unemployment remains at historically high levels and consumer spending remains pressured. As such, our near-term visibility remains limited.

In late April 2009, the World Health Organization acknowledged an outbreak of swine influenza (“H1N1”), which was categorized as a
pandemic in June 2009, with reported cases in Mexico and eight other countries. In response, travel advisories were issued by several countries against non-essential travel, primarily to Mexico. Expedia observed an increase in cancellation activity
from both customers traveling to higher risk destinations and customers in APAC regions, which have a heightened sensitivity to virus risk. However, the pandemic does not seem to have intensified, and any related cancellation activity has abated.

Airline Sector

The airline sector in particular has historically experienced significant turmoil. U.S. airlines responded to chronic overcapacity, financial losses and extreme volatility in oil prices by
aggressively reducing their cost structures and seating capacities. Reduced seating capacities are generally negative for Expedia as there is less air supply available on our websites, and in turn less opportunity to facilitate hotel rooms, car
rental and other services on behalf of air travelers. Most carriers aggressively reduced capacities in 2008 and 2009, and at this time, plans for re-visiting capacity expansion in 2010 appear to be relatively limited.

In 2008, many carriers raised their per seat yields by increasing fares, assessing fuel surcharges and increasing the use of a la carte
pricing for such items as baggage, food and beverage and preferred seating. To a large degree, the use of ancillary fees to supplement revenues have remained, and in some cases been expanded. However, as overall travel demand waned at the end of
2008 and into 2009, carriers began lowering ticket prices in order to attract more leisure travelers.

Expedia generally favors
a low fare environment, as low fares tend to encourage leisure travel, leave more of the travel budget for hotel spend and because our air revenues are tied principally to ticket volumes, not prices. Hence, the 2009 fare environment was a favorable
one for Expedia, as airfares on tickets sold by Expedia decreased 15% in 2009. More recently, however, given the stabilization in the macro economy and aggressive capacity reductions, carriers have been cutting fares less aggressively. In the fourth
quarter of 2009, fares were down just 4%, and our expectations are for fares to begin growing again in 2010.

In addition to
capacity and pricing actions, carriers have responded to industry conditions by aggressively reducing costs in every aspect of their operations, including distribution costs. Prior to 2008, airlines lowered (and in some cases, eliminated) travel
agent commissions and overrides, and increased direct distribution through their proprietary websites. Carriers also reduced payments to GDS intermediaries, which have historically passed on a portion of these payments to large travel agents,
including Expedia.

In 2009, Expedia.com and other major online travel agencies began offering air tickets to consumers without
an associated online booking fee, matching the airline supplier sites, which also do not charge online booking fees. Expedia has broadened this fee elimination to many of its international websites, as well as removed most







change/cancel fees in excess of those charged by travel suppliers. These fee actions, combined with the above reductions in distribution costs, have combined to reduce Expedia’s global
revenue per ticket by over 30% in the past three years.

As a result of the above industry dynamics and the strength of our
other product lines, in 2009 air revenue constituted just 12% of our global revenues. We may encounter additional pressure on air remuneration as certain supply agreements renew in 2010 and beyond, and as air carriers and GDSs re-negotiate their
long-term agreements in 2011.

In addition to the above challenges, larger carriers participating in the Expedia marketplace
have generally reduced their share of total air seat capacity, while leading low-cost carriers such as Southwest in the United States have increased their relative capacities, but have generally chosen not to participate in the Expedia marketplace.
This trend has negatively impacted our ability to obtain supply in our air business, and increased the relative attractiveness of other online and offline sales channels.

Hotel Sector

In 2008, the hotel sector witnessed supply growth and
slowing demand, resulting in declining occupancy rates. ADR growth, which had been robust in 2006 and 2007, slowed considerably throughout 2008, and by the end of the year had stopped growing entirely. Some key leisure travel markets for Expedia,
such as Las Vegas and Hawaii, have experienced dramatic year-on-year declines in ADRs. In 2009, we experienced a 15% decline in global ADRs due primarily to weak travel demand and continued supply expansion.

While lower occupancies have historically increased the availability of discounted hotel rooms, and a lower rate of ADR growth can positively
impact underlying room night growth, lower ADRs also decrease our revenue per room night as our remuneration varies proportionally with the room price. Revenue per room night in 2009 declined 17% primarily due to the downward movement in ADRs as
well as adverse movements in foreign exchange rates and lower fees.

In 2009, the industry declines in occupancies and ADRs
were more severe than those experienced after the 9/11 terror events. And although ADRs appear to have stabilized somewhat throughout 2009, they are still expected to be down in the low to mid single digits for at least the first half of 2010. These
trends, combined with softer demand in a weakening economy and lower air capacity into our core leisure travel destinations, create a challenging backdrop for our hotel business, which generates nearly two-thirds of our worldwide revenue and an even
greater percentage of our profitability.

Online Travel

Increased usage and familiarity with the internet have driven rapid growth in online penetration of travel expenditures. According to
PhoCusWright, an independent travel, tourism and hospitality research firm, in 2009 approximately 56% of U.S. leisure, unmanaged and corporate travel expenditures occurred online, compared with approximately 32% of European travel. Online
penetration in the Asia Pacific region is estimated to lag behind that of Europe. These penetration rates have increased over the past few years, and are expected to continue growing. This significant growth has attracted many competitors to online
travel. This competition has intensified in recent years, and the industry is expected to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future.

In addition to the growth of online travel agencies, airlines and lodging companies have aggressively pursued direct online distribution of their products and services, and supplier growth outpaced online
agency growth for several years. As a result, according to PhoCusWright, by 2009 travel supplier sites accounted for 61% of total online travel spend in the United States. More recently, due to booking fee reductions and eliminations, online agents
appear to be regaining share of overall online travel spend. Our visibility on whether these share gains continue once we pass the anniversary of the fee actions in late 2010 is limited.

Differentiation among the various website offerings has narrowed dramatically in the past several years, and the travel landscape has grown
extremely competitive, with the need for competitors to generally differentiate their offerings on features other than price. Competitive entrants such as “metasearch” companies have in some







cases been able to introduce differentiated features and content compared with the legacy online travel agency companies; although in most cases they are not providing actual travel booking
services. Some of these competitors have raised significant amounts of capital and have begun to aggressively market their service offerings. In early 2009, TripAdvisor.com launched a competitive metasearch travel offering featuring a Fee Estimator
enabling customers to see the price of their flight including various airline fees such as baggage charges.

The online travel
industry has also seen the development of alternative business models and variations in the timing of payment by travelers and to suppliers, which in some cases place pressure on historical business models. In particular, the agency hotel model has
seen rapid adoption in Europe, and Expedia has only recently introduced a competitive offering. While agency hotel is an important component of our European strategy, we expect it will take time to gain traction with incremental hotel suppliers, and
for Expedia to drive meaningful demand to those hotels.

Intense competition has also historically led to aggressive marketing
spend by the travel suppliers and intermediaries, and a meaningful reduction in our overall marketing efficiencies and operating margins. In 2009, we experienced a reversal of these trends due to several factors including the softer macro
environment, lower ad rates and a pullback in spend by some of our online competitors impacted by lower fee revenues, but there can be no assurance that reversal will continue in the future.

Strategy

We play a fundamental role in facilitating travel, whether for leisure, unmanaged business or managed business travelers. We are committed to providing travelers, travel suppliers and advertisers the world over with the best set of
resources to serve their travel needs by leveraging Expedia’s critical assets — our brand portfolio, technology and content innovation, global reach and breadth of product offering. In addition, we intelligently utilize our growing
base of knowledge about destinations, activities, suppliers and travelers and our central position in the travel value chain to more effectively merchandise our travel offerings.

A discussion of the critical assets that we leverage in achieving our business strategy follows:

Portfolio of Travel Brands.We seek to appeal to the broadest possible range of travelers, suppliers and
advertisers through our collection of industry-leading brands. We target several different demographics, from the value-conscious traveler through our Hotwire brand to luxury travelers seeking a high-touch, customized vacation package through our
Classic Vacations brand.

We believe our flagship Expedia brand appeals to the broadest range of travelers, with our extensive
product offering ranging from single item bookings of discounted product to dynamic bundling of higher-end travel packages. Our hotels.com site and its international versions target travelers with premium hotel content such as 360 degree tours and
hotel reviews. In the United States, hotels.com generally appeals to travelers with shorter booking windows who prefer to drive to their destinations, and who make a significant portion of their travel bookings over the telephone.

Through Egencia, we make travel products and services available on a managed basis to corporate travelers in North America, Europe and the
Asia Pacific region. Further, our TripAdvisor Media Network allows us to reach a broad range of travelers with travel opinions and user-generated content.

We believe our appeal to suppliers and advertisers is further enhanced by our geographic breadth and range of business models, allowing them to offer their products and services to the industry’s
broadest range of travelers using our various agency, merchant and advertising business models. We intend to continue supporting and investing in our brand portfolio, geographic footprint and business models for the benefit of our travelers,
suppliers and advertisers.

Technology and Content Innovation.Expedia has an established
tradition of technology innovation, from Expedia.com’s inception as a division of Microsoft to our introduction of more recent innovations such as Expedia’s introduction of its “Expedia Easy Manage” program, offering smaller
properties in secondary and







tertiary markets in Europe and Asia Pacific through an agency model hotel program, Media Solutions introduction of rich media display ads called StorePoint Expandables, TripAdvisor’s launch
of its Family Vacation Critic, which offers reviews of kid-friendly and parent-tested hotels, resorts, attractions and destinations to help parents select the best family vacation, and FlipKey’s launch of self-service listings for vacation
property owners to merchandise their offerings.

We intend to continue innovating on behalf of our travelers, suppliers and
advertisers with particular focus on improving the traveler experience, supplier integration and presentation, platform improvements, search engine marketing and search engine optimization.

Global Reach.Our Expedia, hotels.com and TripAdvisor Media Network brands operate both in North America
and internationally. We also offer Chinese travelers an array of products and services through our majority ownership in eLong and through our TripAdvisor brands daodao.com and kuxun.cn, and we offer hotels to European-based travelers through our
wholly-owned subsidiary Venere, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2008. In 2009, approximately 34% of our worldwide gross bookings and 37% of worldwide revenue were international.

Egencia, our corporate travel business, operates in North America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and the Asia Pacific region using direct
points of sale as well as strategic partnerships. We believe the corporate travel sector represents a significant opportunity for Expedia, and we believe we offer a compelling technology solution to businesses seeking to optimize travel costs and
improve their employees’ travel experiences. We intend to continue investing in and expanding the geographic footprint and technology infrastructure of Egencia.

In expanding our global reach, we leverage significant investments in technology, operations, brand building, supplier relationships and other initiatives that we have made since the launch of Expedia.com
in 1996. We intend to continue leveraging this investment when launching additional points of sale in new countries, introducing new website features, adding supplier products and services including new business model offerings, as well as
proprietary and user-generated content for travelers.

Our scale of operations enhances the value of technology innovations we
introduce on behalf of our travelers and suppliers. As an example, our traveler review feature — whereby our travelers have created millions of qualified reviews of hotel properties — is able to accumulate a larger base of
reviews due to the higher base of online traffic that frequents our various websites. In addition, our increasing scale enhances our websites’ appeal to travel and non-travel advertisers.

We intend to continue investing in and growing our international points of sale. We anticipate launching points of sale in additional
countries where we find large travel markets and rapid growth of online commerce. Future launches may occur under any of our brands, or through acquisition of third party brands, as in the case of eLong, Venere, Kuxun and Egencia.

Breadth of Product Offering.We offer a comprehensive array of innovative travel products and services to our
travelers. We plan to continue improving and growing these offerings, as well as expand them to our worldwide points of sale over time. Travelers can interact with us how and when they prefer, including via our 24/7 1-800 telesales service, which is
an integral part of the Company’s appeal to travelers.

Over 60% of our revenue comes from transactions involving the
booking of hotel reservations, with less than 15% of our worldwide revenue derived from the sale of airline tickets. We facilitate travel products and services either as stand-alone products or as part of package transactions. We have emphasized
growing our merchant hotel and packages businesses as these result in higher revenue per transaction; however, we are working to grow our global agency hotel business through our Venere brand as well as our Expedia and hotel.com brands. We also seek
to continue diversifying our revenue mix beyond core air and hotel products to car rental, destination services, cruise and other product offerings. We have been working toward and will continue to work toward increasing the mix of advertising and
media revenue from both the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as increasing advertising revenue from our worldwide websites such as Expedia.com and hotels.com, which have historically been focused on transaction revenue. In 2009,
advertising and media revenue accounted for approximately 11% of worldwide revenue.







Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and services. For example, traditional leisure travel
bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and holiday travel. The number of bookings typically decreases in the fourth quarter. Because revenue in the merchant business is
generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. The
macroeconomic downturn in the latter part of 2008 also affected our general revenue seasonality trends in the fourth quarter of 2008. In addition, the continued growth of our international operations or a change in our product mix may influence the
typical trend of our seasonality in the future.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates

Critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe are important in the preparation of our consolidated financial
statements because they require that we use judgment and estimates in applying those policies. We prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(“GAAP”). Preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as revenue and expenses during the periods reported. We base our estimates on historical experience, where applicable, and other assumption that we believe are reasonable
under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

There are
certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:



•It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we
were making the estimate; and/or



•Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of
operations.

For more information on each of these policies, see Note 2 — Significant
Accounting Policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements. We discuss information about the nature and rationale for our critical accounting estimates below.

Accounting for Certain Merchant Revenue

We accrue the cost of
certain merchant revenue based on the amount we expect to be billed by suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an
allowance, when we determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and contract terms. Actual revenue could be greater or less than the amounts estimated due to changes in hotel billing
practices or changes in traveler behavior.

Marketing Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services, which include inducement
offers. Inducement offers include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We allocate
the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers, and the
amounts we record as a reduction to revenue on current purchases could vary significantly based on the redemption estimates used.







Loyalty Program Accruals

We offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers, such as our hotels.com welcomerewards program.
Welcomerewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. As travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we record a liability for the
estimated future cost of redemptions. We determine the future redemption obligation based on judgment factors including: (i) the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed, and (ii) an estimated redemption rate based on the overall
accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products, which is determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques. The actual future cost and rate of redemptions could differ materially from our
estimates.

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite and Definite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill.We assess goodwill for impairment annually as of October 1, or more frequently, if events and
circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. The impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is
potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis, we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value
should such a circumstance arise.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of
the present value of future discounted cash flows and market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to
generate in the future. Our significant estimates in the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation
approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies
with comparable business factors such as size, growth, profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting
units because these are the most common valuation methodologies used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.

In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair
values of our reporting units in relation to the Company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or
the average stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to
repurchase the debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.

Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets.We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. This
method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related
brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital.

Definite-Lived Intangible
Assets.We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable.
Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the
asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of an







asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets
over the remaining economic life of the primary asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate
valuation methodologies, which would typically include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value.

The use of different estimates or assumptions in determining the fair value of our goodwill, indefinite-lived and definite-lived intangible
assets may result in different values for these assets, which could result in an impairment or, in period in which an impairment is recognized, could result in a materially different impairment charge. For additional information about our goodwill
and intangible asset impairments recorded in 2008, see Note 5 — Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

We record income taxes under the liability method.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the
differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect
when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future
taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be
realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates.
Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.

We record liabilities to address uncertain tax
positions we have taken in previously filed tax returns or that we expect to take in a future tax return. The determination for required liabilities is based upon an analysis of each individual tax position, taking into consideration whether it is
more likely than not that our tax position, based on technical merits, will be sustained upon examination. For those positions for which we conclude it is more likely than not it will be sustained, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that
is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority. The difference between the amount recognized and the total tax position is recorded as a liability. The ultimate resolution of these tax
positions may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

Other Long-Term Liabilities

Various Legal and Tax Contingencies.We record liabilities to address potential exposures related to business
and tax positions we have taken that have been or could be challenged by taxing authorities. In addition, we record liabilities associated with legal proceedings and lawsuits. These liabilities are recorded when the likelihood of payment is probable
and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The determination for required liabilities is based upon analysis of each individual tax issue, or legal proceeding, taking into consideration the likelihood of adverse judgments and the range of possible
loss. In addition, our analysis may be based on discussions with outside legal counsel. The ultimate resolution of these potential tax exposures and legal proceedings may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

Occupancy Tax.Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or
occupancy of hotel accommodations. Generally, hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax
recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do we pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer







payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that we are not required
to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we are required to
collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. Certain jurisdictions may require us to pay tax assessments, including occupancy tax assessments, prior to contesting any such
assessments.

We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes for prior
and current periods, consistent with applicable accounting principles and in light of all current facts and circumstances. A variety of factors could affect the amount of the liability (both past and future), which factors include, but are not
limited to, the number of, and amount of revenue represented by, jurisdictions that ultimately assert a claim and prevail in assessing such additional tax or negotiate a settlement and changes in relevant statutes.

We note that there are more than 7,000 taxing jurisdictions in the United States, and it is not feasible to analyze the statutes, regulations
and judicial and administrative rulings in every jurisdiction. Rather, we have obtained the advice of state and local tax experts with respect to tax laws of certain states and local jurisdictions that represent a large portion of our hotel revenue.
Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the internet and e-commerce. It is possible that some jurisdictions may introduce new legislation regarding the imposition of occupancy
taxes on businesses that arrange the booking of hotel accommodations. We continue to work with the relevant tax authorities and legislators to clarify our obligations under new and emerging laws and regulations. We will continue to monitor the issue
closely and provide additional disclosure, as well as adjust the level of reserves, as developments warrant. Additionally, certain of our businesses are involved in occupancy tax related litigation which is discussed in Part I, Item 3,
Legal Proceedings.

Stock-Based Compensation

In the first quarter of 2009, we awarded stock options as our primary form of employee stock-based compensation. We measure the value of
stock option awards on the date of grant at fair value using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the remaining term on a straight-line basis. The Black-Scholes model requires
various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility and expected option term. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that
recorded in the current period.

We record stock-based compensation expense net of estimated forfeitures. In determining the
estimated forfeiture rates for stock-based awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider many factors when
estimating expected forfeitures, including the type of award, the employee class and historical experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated
estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised.

New Accounting Pronouncements

For a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 —
Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Segments

Beginning in the first quarter of 2009, we have three reportable segments: Leisure, the TripAdvisor Media Network and Egencia. The change
from two reportable segments, North America and Europe, was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands. We determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating
decisions and evaluate operating performance.







Our Leisure segment provides a full range of travel and advertising services to our
worldwide customers through a variety of brands including: Expedia.com and hotels.com in the United States and localized Expedia and hotels.com websites throughout the world, Expedia Affiliate Network, Hotwire.com, Venere, eLong and Classic
Vacations.

Our TripAdvisor Media Network segment provides advertising services to travel suppliers on its websites, which
aggregate traveler opinions and unbiased travel articles about cities, hotels, restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through tripadvisor.com and its localized international versions as well as through its various travel media
content properties within the TripAdvisor Media Network.

Our Egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate
customers in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.

Reclassifications

During the first quarter of 2009, our development and information technology teams were effectively combined to better support our global
brands. As a result of our reorganization, in addition to costs to develop and maintain our website and internal use applications, technology and content expense now also includes the majority of information technology costs such as costs to support
and operate our network and back-office applications (including related data center costs), system monitoring and network security, and other technology leadership and support functions. The most significant reclassification of costs occurred
between general and administrative expense and technology and content expense as, historically, a significant portion of the information technology costs were within general and administrative expense. Technology costs to operate our live site and
call center applications in production remained in cost of revenue. For a detail of the amounts reclassified for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, see Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the consolidated
financial statements.

Operating Metrics

Our operating results are affected by certain metrics, such as gross bookings and revenue margin, which we believe are necessary for understanding and evaluating Expedia. Gross bookings represent the
total retail value of transactions booked for both agency and merchant transactions, recorded at the time of booking reflecting the total price due for travel by travelers, including taxes, fees and other charges, and are generally reduced for
cancellations and refunds. As travelers have increased their use of the internet to book travel arrangements, we have seen our gross bookings increase, reflecting the growth in the online travel industry and our business acquisitions. Revenue margin
is defined as revenue as a percentage of gross bookings.

(1)The TripAdvisor Media Network, which is comprised of media businesses that differ from our transaction-based websites and our Egencia business, does not have associated
gross bookings or revenue margin. However, third-party revenue from the TripAdvisor Media Network is included in revenue used to calculate total revenue margin.

The increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to an 18% growth in transactions, substantially offset
by lower prices for airline tickets and hotel room nights. The increase in worldwide gross bookings in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to increases in transaction volumes and travel product prices.

The decrease in revenue margin in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to the reduction in traveler fees, the impact of our loyalty
programs and a greater mix of lower margin hotels, partially offset by lower air ticket prices and a reduction in the mix of lower margin air product. The increase in revenue margin in 2008 as compared to 2007 was primarily due to an increased mix
of advertising and media revenue.

Results of Operations

Revenue



Year ended December 31,% Change2009200820072009 vs 20082008 vs 2007($ in millions)Revenue by SegmentLeisure$2,635$2,626$2,4490%7%TripAdvisor Media Network (Third-party revenue)2122011256%60%Egencia10811091(1)%20%Total revenue$2,955$2,937$2,6651%10%

In 2009, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases within our Leisure
segment in hotel, car and advertising and media revenue and an increase within our TripAdvisor Media Segment in advertising and media revenue. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in air revenue.

Worldwide hotel revenue increased 2% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 23% increase in room nights stayed, including rooms
delivered as a component of packages and room nights booked through Venere (which we acquired in September 2008), partially offset by a 17% decline in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night declined largely due to a 15% decrease in ADRs,
including a reduction in traveler fees. Excluding room nights stayed through Venere, room nights grew 20% for the year.

Worldwide air revenue decreased 13% in 2009 compared to 2008 due to a 24% decrease in revenue per air ticket, partially offset by a 15% increase in ticket volumes. Expedia.com eliminated consumer booking fees on online air tickets in March
2009, with certain other points of sale following at various dates into the third quarter of 2009, which primarily drove the decline in revenue per ticket. This elimination of fees on Expedia.com and other points of sale, combined with lower average
ticket prices, contributed to the increase in our air ticketing volumes.

Worldwide revenue other than hotel and air discussed
above, which includes advertising and media, car rental, destination services and agency cruise, increased by 5% in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to an increase in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue.

In 2008, the increase in revenue was primarily due to increases in worldwide hotel revenue and advertising and media revenue.

Worldwide hotel revenue increased 6% in 2008 compared to 2007. The increase was primarily due to a 13% increase in room nights stayed,
including rooms delivered as a component of vacation packages, partially offset







by a 6% decrease in revenue per room night. Revenue per room night decreased due to changes in foreign exchange rates and a 2% decrease in worldwide ADRs.

Worldwide air revenue increased 2% in 2008 compared to 2007 due to a 2% increase in revenue per air ticket. Tickets sold were flat for the
year as an 8% growth in the first half of the year was offset by an 8% decline in the second half of the year due to lower passenger volumes as a result of carrier capacity cuts and softer consumer demand.

Our remaining worldwide revenue other than hotel and air revenue discussed above increased by 29% in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to
increases in our advertising and media revenue and car rental revenue.

In addition to the above segment and product revenue
discussion, our revenue by business model is as follows:

Our merchant revenue for 2009 compared to 2008 was relatively flat as increases in car
revenue were offset by decreases in air revenue. The increase in merchant revenue for 2008 compared to 2007 was driven by an increase in hotel revenue primarily due to higher room nights stayed, partially offset by lower ADRs.

Agency revenue decreased for 2009 compared to 2008 due to a decrease in air revenue primarily resulting from our Expedia.com U.S. booking fee
removal and decreased agency package revenue, partially offset by higher hotel revenue related to Venere and higher car revenue. Agency revenue increased for 2008 compared to 2007 due to increases in air, hotel and car revenue.

Advertising and media revenue increased in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a 21% increase in advertising revenue at our Leisure
transaction-based websites as well as a 6% increase at TripAdvisor Media Network. Advertising and media revenue increased in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increased revenue at TripAdvisor Media Network.

Cost of revenue primarily consists of (1) customer operations, including our
customer support and telesales as well as fees to air ticket fulfillment vendors, (2) credit card processing, including merchant fees, charge backs and fraud, and (3) other costs, primarily including data center costs to support our
websites, certain promotions, destination supply, and stock-based compensation.

In 2009, the primary drivers of the decrease
in cost of revenue expense were a decrease in credit card processing costs as a result of our technology investments, lower promotions expense and air fulfillment efficiencies primarily resulting from bringing some of our air ticket fulfillment
operations in-house. We expect cost of revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010.







In 2008, the primary drivers of the increase in cost of revenue expense were an increase in
customer operation costs primarily due to an increase in transaction volumes during 2008 versus 2007, an increase of credit card processing fees due to the increase in merchant bookings and an increase in promotions expense.

Selling and Marketing



Year ended December 31,% Change2009200820072009 vs 20082008 vs 2007($ in millions)Direct costs$747$826$762(10)%8%Indirect costs2802792330%20%Total selling and marketing$1,027$1,105$995(7)%11%% of revenue34.8%37.6%37.3%

Selling and marketing expense primarily relates to direct costs, including traffic
generation costs from search engines and internet portals, television, radio and print spending, private label and affiliate program commissions, public relations and other costs. The remainder of the expense relates to indirect costs, including
personnel and related overhead in our Partner Services Group (“PSG”), the TripAdvisor Media Network, Egencia and Expedia Local Expert and stock-based compensation costs.

Selling and marketing expenses decreased $78 million in 2009 compared to 2008 due to lower offline brand spending for our global websites,
lower online spend as well as lower private label and affiliate expenses associated with the lower overall travel demand environment. Offline and online advertising spend decreased primarily as a result of a lower cost advertising environment, our
investments in search engine optimization and marketing, and costs for other customer value enhancements that stimulate demand but do not impact selling and marketing expense such as fee reductions and loyalty programs. These decreases were
partially offset by an increase in direct costs for Venere. We expect selling and marketing expense to increase as a percentage of revenue in 2010 in part due to approximately $20 million in relocation and other costs related to the opening of a
global headquarters for our lodging supply group.

In 2008, selling and marketing expense increased $110 million primarily due
to a $64 million increase in direct costs resulting from an increase in online marketing primarily driven by increase spend related to the expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network as well as increased expenses at our international points of sale,
offset slight by a decrease in other direct marketing. Indirect costs included in selling and marketing expense increased $46 million primarily due to increased headcount in the TripAdvisor Media Network, PSG, Egencia and European points of sale.

Technology and Content

Technology and content expense includes product development and content expense, as
well as information technology costs to support our infrastructure, back-office applications and overall monitoring and security of our networks, and is principally comprised of personnel and overhead, depreciation and amortization of technology
assets including hardware, and purchased and internally developed software, and other costs including licensing and maintenance expense and stock-based compensation.







The year-over-year increase of $32 million in technology and content expense in 2009 was
primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization of technology assets as well as increased incentive compensation expense. We expect technology and content expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010.

The year-over-year increase of $42 million in 2008 was primarily due to increased personnel-related expenses primarily in our higher growth
businesses, including the TripAdvisor Media Network, as well as an increase in the amortization of software development costs.

General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel-related costs,
including our executive leadership, finance, legal and human resource functions as well as fees for external professional services including legal, tax and accounting, and other costs including stock-based compensation.

In 2009, the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily due to an increase in legal fees, settlements and other
professional fees of $16 million, including costs related to the consumer class action lawsuit and occupancy tax matters, as well as higher personnel costs resulting from increased incentive compensation expense. We expect general and administrative
expense to decrease as a percentage of revenue in 2010.

In 2008, the increase in general and administrative expense was
primarily due to an increase in personnel and overhead costs of $16 million. Personnel and overhead costs increased due to increased headcount related to the continued expansion of our TripAdvisor Media Network and European points of sale, including
through acquisitions such as Venere, as well as higher incentive compensation at certain points of sale.

In 2009 and 2008, the decrease in amortization of intangible assets expense was
primarily due to the completion of amortization related to certain technology and supplier relationship intangible assets, partially offset by amortization related to new business acquisitions. In 2009, the completion of amortization related to
certain distribution agreements also contributed to the decrease. For additional information about our acquisitions, see Note 3 — Acquisitions and Other Investments in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

Occupancy Tax Assessments and Legal Reserves

During 2009, we recognized $48 million related to monies paid in advance of litigation in the San Francisco occupancy tax proceedings and an accrual of $19 million for the estimated settlement cost of the
Expedia consumer class action lawsuit. For additional information, see Note 14 — Commitments and Contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.







Restructuring Charges

During 2009, in conjunction with the reorganization of our business around our global brands, and the resulting centralization of locations
and brand management, marketing and administrative personnel as well as certain customer operations centers, we recognized $34 million in restructuring charges. These charges were primarily related to employee severance and related benefits.
Restructuring charges related to the brand reorganization were substantially completed by the end of 2009. For additional information, see Note 12 — Restructuring Charges in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.

Impairment of Goodwill, Intangible and Other Long-lived Assets

In 2008, we recorded impairments of approximately $3 billion of long-term assets, which consisted of $2.8 billion of goodwill,
$223 million of intangible assets and $11 million related to capitalized software. Impaired intangible assets consisted of certain of our indefinite-lived trade names. For additional information about our impairments, see Note 5
— Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net in the notes to consolidated financial statements.

We recorded no such impairments
in 2009.

Operating Income (Loss)

In 2009, the change to operating income was due to the prior year impairment of
long-term assets of approximately $3 billion. In addition, selling and marketing expense and cost of revenue decreased compared to the increase in revenue, partially offset by the San Francisco occupancy tax assessments, restructuring charges and
class action settlement legal reserve as well as growth in technology and content and general and administrative expenses at rates in excess of revenue growth.

In 2008, the recording of a significant operating loss and the resulting year-over-year decline was due to the impairment of long-term assets of approximately $3 billion.

Interest income decreased in 2009 and 2008 primarily due to lower average interest
rates.

Interest expense increased in 2009 and 2008 primarily resulting from interest on the $400 million senior unsecured
notes issued in June 2008. The increase in 2009 was partially offset by lower interest expense related to our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our long-term indebtedness totaled $895 million, $1.545 billion
and $1.085 billion.

euros to economically hedge the purchase price, we recognized a net loss of $21 million, included in foreign exchange rate losses, net.

In 2007, we recognized a $12 million gain related to federal excise tax refunds from the Internal Revenue Service.

Provision for Income Taxes



Year ended December 31,% Change2009200820072009 vs 20082008 vs 2007($ in millions)Provision for income taxes$154$6$203N/A(97)%Effective tax rate33.7%(0.2)%40.9%

In 2009, our effective tax rate was lower than the 35% federal statutory rate
primarily due to a fourth quarter deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary, partially offset by state income taxes. The change in the 2009 effective rate compared to the 2008 rate was primarily due to the impairment of goodwill in
2008, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes. Absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, our 2008 effective tax rate would have been 41.5%, and our 2009 effective rate was lower than this rate
primarily due to the deduction relating to the closure of a foreign subsidiary and, to a lesser extent, lower accruals related to uncertain tax positions. We expect our effective tax rate to benefit in 2010 and beyond based on changes in our
business structure combined with the relative growth in our international business.

In 2008, our effective tax rate differed
from the 35% statutory rate and the 2007 effective rate due to the impairment of goodwill, of which a substantial portion was not deductible for income tax purposes. Absent the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, our 2008 effective tax
rate would have been 41.5%, which was higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes and accruals related to uncertain tax positions and higher than our 2007 rate primarily due to higher accruals related to uncertain tax
positions.

In 2007, our effective tax rate was higher than the 35% statutory rate primarily due to state income taxes, taxes
related to our foreign operations and non-deductible losses related to our derivative liabilities.

Financial Position, Liquidity and
Capital Resources

Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations; our cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investment balances, which were $688 million and $758 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, including $148 million and $145 million of cash and short-term investment balances of majority-owned subsidiaries;
and our revolving credit facility.







As of December 31, 2009, we maintained a $1 billion revolving credit facility of which
$958million was available. This represents the total $1 billion facility less $42 million of outstanding stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”). During 2009, we amended our credit facility to replace our tangible net
worth covenant with a minimum interest coverage covenant, among other changes. As part of this amendment, our leverage ratio was tightened, pricing on our borrowings increased by 200 basis points and we paid approximately $6 million in
fees. Outstanding credit facility borrowings bore interest reflecting our financial leverage. Based on our December 31, 2009 financial statements, the interest rate would equate to a base rate plus 262.5 basis points. At our discretion, we
could choose a base rate equal to (1) the greater of the Prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points or LIBOR plus 100 basis points or (2) various durations of LIBOR.

In February 2010, we reached agreement on a new $750 million, three-year revolving credit facility, replacing our prior credit facility.
Pricing is based on the Company’s credit ratings, with drawn amounts bearing interest at LIBOR plus 300 basis points, and undrawn amounts bearing interest at 50 basis points. Financial covenants remain the same under the new facility. We
incurred approximately $8 million in fees, which will be amortized over the life of the credit facility. We currently have no borrowings outstanding under the facility.

Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by rating agencies. In October 2009, our long-term ratings from Moody’s and Standard and Poor’s were raised to Ba1 and BBB-, respectively. Both
agencies issued a stable ratings outlook at that time. Changes in our operating results, cash flows, or financial position could impact the ratings assigned by the various rating agencies. Should our credit ratings be adjusted downward, we may incur
higher costs to borrow, which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations.

On
February 10, 2010, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share of outstanding common stock, the first dividend in our history. Future declarations of dividends are
subject to final determination of our Board of Directors. Based on our current shares outstanding, we estimate this quarterly dividend payment will be approximately $20 million.

Under the merchant model, we receive cash from travelers at the time of booking and we record these amounts on our consolidated balance
sheets as deferred merchant bookings. We pay our airline suppliers related to these merchant model bookings generally within a few weeks after completing the transaction, but we are liable for the full value of such transactions until the flights
are completed. For most other merchant bookings, which is primarily our merchant hotel business, we pay after the travelers’ use and subsequent billing from the hotel suppliers. Therefore, generally we receive cash from the traveler prior to
paying our supplier, and this operating cycle represents a working capital source of cash to us. As long as the merchant hotel business grows, we expect that changes in working capital will positively impact operating cash flows. If this business
model declines relative to our other businesses, or if there are changes to the model or booking patterns which compress the time of receipts of cash from travelers to payments to suppliers, our working capital benefits could be reduced.

Seasonal fluctuations in our merchant hotel bookings affect the timing of our annual cash flows. During the first half of the year, hotel
bookings have traditionally exceeded stays, resulting in much higher cash flow related to working capital. During the second half of the year, this pattern reverses and cash flows are typically negative. While we expect the impact of seasonal
fluctuations to continue, merchant hotel growth rates or changes to the model or booking patterns as discussed above may affect working capital, which might counteract or intensify the anticipated seasonal fluctuations.

As of December 31, 2009, we had a deficit in our working capital of $610 million, compared to a deficit of $367 million as of
December 31, 2008 primarily due to the repayment of $650 million of borrowings under our credit facility and capital expenditures, partially offset by cash generated from operations during 2009.

We continue to invest in the development and expansion of our operations. Ongoing investments include but are not limited to improvements to
infrastructure, which include our servers, networking equipment and software, release improvements to our software code and search engine marketing and optimization efforts. Our future capital requirements may include capital needs for acquisitions,
share repurchases or expenditures in support of our business strategy. In the event we have acquisitions or share repurchases, this may reduce our cash balance and/or increase our debt.







Our cash flows are as follows:



Year ended December 31,$ Change2009200820072009 vs 20082008 vs 2007(In millions)Cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$676$521$712$155$(191)Investing activities(48)(860)(180)812(680)Financing activities(660)465(790)(1,125)1,255Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents9(78)2287(100)

In 2009, net cash provided by operating activities increased by $155 million
primarily due to increased benefits from working capital changes and growth in operating income after adjusting for the impacts of depreciation and amortization, partially offset by an increase in income tax and interest payments as well as
occupancy tax assessments. In 2008, net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $191 million primarily due to a decrease in changes in operating assets and liabilities, including an increase in tax payments and faster invoice and
payment processing for our hotel suppliers.

In connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments, certain
jurisdictions may assert that taxpayers are required to pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances, which is referred to as “pay-to-play.” These jurisdictions may also attempt
to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of similar tax ordinances. Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such
payments are made, we will continue to defend our position vigorously. During 2009, we paid $48 million related to tax assessments in San Francisco.

In 2009, cash used in investing activities represented a positive change of $812 million in cash flows primarily due to a $493 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, cash provided by
the net maturities of short-term investments of $47 million in 2009 compared to $93 million in purchases in 2008 and a decrease in capital expenditures of $68 million. In 2008, cash used in investing activities increased by $680 million
primarily due to a $479 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions, including $93 million as a contingent payment for the financial performance of a company we acquired during 2007, as well as the purchase of short-term investments of
$93 million by eLong and an increase in capital expenditures of $73 million.

Cash used in financing activities in
2009 primarily included the repayment of $650 million of borrowings under the credit facility. Cash provided by financing activities in 2008 primarily included $457 million of net borrowings of debt. Cash used in financing activities in 2007
primarily included cash paid to acquire shares in two tender offers where we acquired 55 million shares of our common stock for a total cost of $1.385 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offers. In addition, we paid
withholding taxes for stock option exercises of $121 million on behalf of our Chairman and Senior Executive in exchange for surrendering a portion of his vested shares which were concurrently cancelled. These were offset in part by
$585 million in net borrowings on the revolving credit facility, $55 million in proceeds from stock option exercises and $96 million in excess tax benefits on equity awards, of which approximately $92 million related to the
excess tax benefit associated with the stock options exercised by our Chairman and Senior Executive.

In June 2008, we
privately placed $400 million of 8.5% senior unsecured notes due in July 2016 (the “8.5% Notes”). The 8.5% Notes were issued at 98.572% of par resulting in a discount, which is being amortized over their life. Interest
is payable semi-annually in January and July of each year, beginning January 1, 2009. We used the proceeds, net of the discount and issuance costs, of $392 million to repay the then outstanding borrowings under our credit facility of
$330 million with the remaining cash was used for general corporate purposes.

The effect of foreign exchange on our cash
balances denominated in foreign currency in 2009 showed a net increase of $87 million primarily due to the relative appreciation in foreign currencies during 2009 compared to their depreciation in 2008.







The effect of foreign exchange on our cash balances denominated in foreign currency in 2008
showed a net decrease of $100 million primarily due to a sharp depreciation in foreign currencies during the second half of 2008 compared with appreciating foreign currencies throughout 2007, and included a $21 million loss related to euro
cash holdings during the third quarter of 2008 to economically hedge the purchase price of an acquisition.

We currently have
authorization, for which there is no fixed termination date, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to 20 million outstanding shares of our common stock; no such repurchases have been made under this authorization. The number of shares we
may make under this authorization is subject to certain of our debt covenants.

We also have a shelf registration statement
filed with the SEC under which Expedia, Inc. may offer from time to time debt securities, guarantees of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock or warrants. The shelf registration statement expires on October 15, 2010.

In our opinion, available cash, funds from operations and available borrowings will provide sufficient capital resources to meet our
foreseeable liquidity needs. Our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the credit market disruptions, which were more pronounced in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first half of 2009. There can be no assurance, however, that future
borrowings, including refinancings, if any, will be available on terms acceptable to us.

Contractual Obligations and
Commercial Commitments

(1)Our 8.5% Notes and 7.456% Notes include interest payments through maturity in 2016 and 2018, respectively, based on the stated fixed rates. In the above
table, we have reflected the 7.456% Notes based on the maturity date in 2018; however such Notes are repayable in whole or in part on August 15, 2013 at the option of the holders.



(2)The operating leases are for office space and related office equipment. We account for these leases on a monthly basis. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation
adjustments and renewal options. Operating lease obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2018.



(3)Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements with certain of our vendors and marketing partners. These minimum obligations are
less than our projected use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.



(4)Guarantees and LOCs are commitments that represent funding responsibilities that may require our performance in the event of third-party demands or contingent events.
We use our stand-by LOCs primarily to secure payment for hotel room transactions to particular hotel properties. The outstanding balance of our stand-by LOCs directly reduces the amount available to us from our revolving credit facility. The LOC
amounts in the above table represent the amount of commitment expiration per period. In addition, we provide a guarantee to the aviation authority of one country to protect against potential non-delivery of our packaged travel services sold within
that country. This country holds all travel agents and tour companies to the same standard.







(5)Excludes $190 million of unrecognized tax benefits for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of payment.

Other than the items described above, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31,
2009.

Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions

For a discussion of certain relationships and related party transactions, see Note 15 — Related Party Transactions in the
notes to consolidated financial statements.

Part II. Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market Risk Management

Market risk is the potential loss from adverse
changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market prices. Our exposure to market risk includes our long-term debt, our revolving credit facility, derivative instruments and cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, intercompany
receivables, merchant accounts payable and deferred merchant bookings denominated in foreign currencies. We manage our exposure to these risks through established policies and procedures. Our objective is to mitigate potential income statement, cash
flow and market exposures from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.

Interest Rate Risk

In June 2008, we issued $400 million senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 8.5%. In August 2006, we issued $500 million
senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 7.456%. As a result, if market interest rates decline, our required payments will exceed those based on market rates. The fair values of our 8.5% Notes and our 7.456% Notes were approximately
$431 million and $546 million as of December 31, 2009 as calculated based on quoted market prices at year end. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our
8.5% Notes by approximately $11 million and our 7.456% Notes by approximately $18 million.

In July 2005,
we entered into a $1 billion revolving credit facility. Interest on the facility was determined by market interest rates plus a spread based on our financial leverage. In February 2010, we entered into a new $750 million revolving credit
facility, which bears interest based on market rates plus a spread determined by our credit ratings. Because our interest rate is tied to a market rate, we will be susceptible to fluctuations in interest rates if, consistent with our practice to
date, we do not hedge the interest rate exposure arising from any borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our outstanding borrowing under the prior revolving credit facility were $0 and
$650 million. We currently have no borrowings outstanding under the new facility.

We did not experience any significant
impact from changes in interest rates for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 or 2007.

Foreign Exchange Risk

We conduct business in certain international markets, primarily in Australia, Canada, China and the European Union.
Because we operate in international markets, we have exposure to different economic climates, political arenas, tax systems and regulations that could affect foreign exchange rates. Our primary exposure to foreign currency risk relates to
transacting in foreign currency and recording the activity in U.S. dollars. Changes in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and these other currencies will result in transaction gains or losses, which we recognize in our consolidated
statements of operations.

To the extent practicable, we minimize our foreign currency exposures by maintaining natural hedges
between our current assets and current liabilities in similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally, during 2008, we began using foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue







exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash and accounts receivable for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. These
instruments are typically short-term and are recorded at fair value with gains and losses recorded in other, net. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a net forward asset of less than $1 million recorded in prepaid expenses and other
current assets and a net forward liability of $1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We may enter into additional foreign exchange derivative contracts or other economic hedges in the future. Our goal in managing our
foreign exchange risk is to reduce to the extent practicable our potential exposure to the changes that exchange rates might have on our earnings, cash flows and financial position. We make a number of estimates in conducting hedging activities
including in some cases the level of future bookings, cancellations, refunds, customer stay patterns and payments in foreign currencies. In the event those estimates differ significantly from actual results, we could experience greater volatility as
a result of our hedges.

Future net transaction gains and losses are inherently difficult to predict as they are reliant on how
the multiple currencies in which we transact fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar, the relative composition and denomination of current assets and liabilities each period, and our effectiveness at forecasting and managing, through balance
sheet netting or the use of derivative contracts, such exposures. As an example, if the foreign currencies in which we hold net asset balances were to all weaken 10% against the U.S. dollar and foreign currencies in which we hold net liability
balances were to all strengthen 10% against the U.S. dollar, we would recognize foreign exchange losses of approximately $1 million based on our foreign currency forward positions (excluding the impact of forward positions economically
hedging our merchant revenue exposures) and the net asset or liability balances of our foreign denominated cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, deferred merchant bookings and merchant accounts payable balances as of December 31,
2009. As the net composition of these balances fluctuate frequently, even daily, as do foreign exchange rates, the example loss could be compounded or reduced significantly within a given period.

During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded net foreign exchange rate losses of $30 million ($20 million excluding the contracts
economically hedging our forecasted merchant revenue), $47 million, and $22 million. As we increase our operations in international markets, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates increases. The economic impact to
us of foreign currency exchange rate movements is linked to variability in real growth, inflation, interest rates, governmental actions and other factors. These changes, if material, could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies.

for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
reporting based on the criteria for effective control over financial reporting described inInternal Control — Integrated Frameworkissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2009, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective. Management has reviewed its assessment with the Audit Committee. Ernst & Young, LLP, an
independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, as stated in their report which is included below.

Limitations on Controls.

Management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well
designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or
fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.







Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia,
Inc.

We have audited Expedia, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on
criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Expedia, Inc.’s management is responsible for maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our
responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We
conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, Expedia, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the 2009 consolidated financial statements of Expedia, Inc. and our report dated February 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

The Board of Directors and Stockholders

Expedia, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Expedia, Inc. as of December 31,
2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’ equity and comprehensive income (loss), and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the three years in the
period ended December 31, 2009. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable
basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,
the consolidated financial position of Expedia, Inc. at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the
Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board, (FASB) No. 160,Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of ARB No. 51, codified in ASC 810,Consolidations, effective January 1,
2009.

We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
Expedia, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
Commission and our report dated February 11, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.

Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

NOTE 1 — Organization and Basis of Presentation

Description of Business

Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide travel products
and services to leisure and corporate travelers in the United States and abroad as well as various media and advertising offerings to travel and non-travel advertisers. These travel products and services are offered through a diversified portfolio
of brands including: Expedia.com®, hotels.com®, Hotwire.comTM, the TripAdvisor®Media Network, Expedia Affiliate Network
(formerly “Worldwide Travel Exchange and Interactive Affiliate Network”), Classic Vacations, Expedia Local Expert, EgenciaTM, Expedia®CruiseShipCenters®, eLongTM, Inc. (“eLong”) and Venere Net SpA
(“Venere”). In addition, many of these brands have related international points of sale. We refer to Expedia, Inc. and its subsidiaries collectively as “Expedia,” the “Company,” “us,” “we” and
“our” in these consolidated financial statements.

Spin-Off from IAC/InterActiveCorp

On December 21, 2004, IAC/InterActiveCorp (“IAC”) announced its plan to separate into two independent public companies. We
refer to this transaction as the “Spin-Off.” A new company, Expedia, Inc., was incorporated under Delaware law in April 2005, to hold substantially all of IAC’s travel and travel-related businesses. On August 9, 2005, the
Spin-Off from IAC was completed and Expedia, Inc. shares began trading on The Nasdaq Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “EXPE.”

Basis of Presentation

The accompanying consolidated financial
statements include Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities we control, or in which we have a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary of expected cash profits or losses. We record our investments in entities that we do
not control, but over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, using the equity method. We have eliminated significant intercompany transactions and accounts.

We believe that the assumptions underlying our consolidated financial statements are reasonable. However, these consolidated financial
statements do not present our future financial position, the results of our future operations and cash flows.

Seasonality

We generally experience seasonal fluctuations in the demand for our travel products and
services. For example, traditional leisure travel bookings are generally the highest in the first three quarters as travelers plan and book their spring, summer and holiday travel. The number of bookings decreases in the fourth quarter. Because
revenue in the merchant business is generally recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, revenue typically lags bookings by several weeks or longer. As a result, revenue is typically the lowest in the first quarter and
highest in the third quarter.

NOTE 2 — Significant Accounting Policies

Consolidation

Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Expedia, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and entities for which we control a majority of the entity’s outstanding common stock. We record noncontrolling interest in our
consolidated financial statements to recognize the minority ownership interest in our consolidated



F-7




Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



subsidiaries. Noncontrolling interest in the earnings and losses of consolidated subsidiaries represent the share of net income or loss allocated to members or partners in our consolidated
entities, which includes, for all periods included in our consolidated financial statements, the noncontrolling interest share of net income or loss from eLong as well as net income or loss from our redeemable noncontrolling interest entities for
certain periods covered by our consolidated financial statements. eLong is a separately listed company on the NASDAQ and, therefore, subject to its own audit which could result in possible adjustments that are not material to Expedia, Inc. but could
be material to eLong.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted authoritative guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) on noncontrolling interests. The guidance states that accounting and reporting for minority interests are to be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity. The calculation of earnings
per share continues to be based on income amounts attributable to the parent. Beginning on January 1, 2009, upon adoption, we recharacterized our minority interest as a noncontrolling interest and classified it as a component of
stockholders’ equity in our consolidated financial statements with the exception of shares redeemable at the option of the minority holders, which are not significant and therefore have been included in other long-term liabilities.

In addition, certain of our subsidiaries that operate in China, including eLong, have variable interests in affiliated entities in China
in order to comply with Chinese laws and regulations, which restricts foreign investment in the air-ticketing, travel agency and internet content provision businesses. Through a series of contractual agreements with these affiliates and their
shareholders, these subsidiaries are the primary beneficiaries of the cash losses or profits of their variable interest affiliates. As such, although we do not own the capital stock of some of our Chinese affiliates, based on our controlling
ownership of the subsidiaries and these contractual arrangements, we consolidate their results.

We have eliminated significant
intercompany transactions and accounts in our consolidated financial statements.

Accounting Estimates

We use estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Our estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our
consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amount of net income or loss during any period. Our actual financial results could differ significantly from these estimates. The significant estimates
underlying our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition; recoverability of current and long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; income and indirect taxes, such as potential settlements related to occupancy taxes; loss
contingencies; stock-based compensation and accounting for derivative instruments.

Subsequent Events

We have evaluated subsequent events and transactions for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial
statements through the time that we filed our financial statements on February 11, 2010.

Reclassifications

We have reclassified certain amounts relating to our prior period results to conform to our current period
presentation. During the first quarter of 2009, our development and information technology teams were effectively combined to better support our global brands. As a result of our reorganization, in addition to costs to develop and maintain our
website and internal use applications, technology and content expense now also includes the majority of information technology costs such as costs to support and operate our network and back-

Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



office applications (including related data center costs), system monitoring and network security, and other technology leadership and support functions. The most significant reclassification of
costs occurred between general and administrative expense and technology and content expense as, historically, a significant portion of the information technology costs were within general and administrative expense. Technology costs to operate our
live site and call center applications in production remained in cost of revenue.

The following table presents a summary of
the amounts as previously reported and as reclassified in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 2007:



Year ended December 31,20082007As reportedAs reclassifiedAs reportedAs reclassified(In thousands)Cost of revenue$634,744$638,709$562,401$565,056Selling and marketing1,101,4031,105,337992,560995,215Technology and content208,952287,763182,483246,063General and administrative355,431268,721321,250252,360

There was no change to operating income (loss) as a result of these reclassifications.

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is earned and realizable based on the following criteria: persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the price is fixed or determinable and
collectibility is reasonably assured.

We also evaluate the presentation of revenue on a gross versus a net basis. The
consensus of the authoritative accounting literature is that the presentation of revenue as “the gross amount billed to a customer because it has earned revenue from the sale of goods or services or the net amount retained (that is, the amount
billed to a customer less the amount paid to a supplier) because it has earned a commission or fee” is a matter of judgment that depends on the relevant facts and circumstances. In making an evaluation of this issue, some of the factors that
should be considered are: whether we are the primary obligor in the arrangement (strong indicator); whether we have general supply risk (before customer order is placed or upon customer return) (strong indicator); and whether we have latitude in
establishing price. The guidance clearly indicates that the evaluations of these factors, which at times can be contradictory, are subject to significant judgment and subjectivity. If the conclusion drawn is that we perform as an agent or a broker
without assuming the risks and rewards of ownership of goods, revenue should be reported on a net basis. For our primary transaction-based revenue models, discussed below, we have determined net presentation is appropriate for the majority of
revenue transactions.

We offer travel products and services on a stand-alone and package basis primarily through the following
business models: the merchant model, the agency model and the media model.

Under the merchant model, we facilitate the booking
of hotel rooms, airline seats, car rentals and destination services from our travel suppliers and we are the merchant of record for such bookings.

Under the agency model, we act as the agent in the transaction, passing reservations booked by the traveler to the relevant travel provider. We receive commissions or ticketing fees from the travel
supplier and/or traveler. For agency airline, hotel and car transactions, we also receive fees from global distribution systems partners that control the computer systems through which these reservations are booked.

Under the media model, we offer travel and non-travel advertisers access to a potential source of incremental traffic and transactions
through our various media and advertising offerings on both the TripAdvisor Media Network and on our transaction-based websites.



F-9




Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



Merchant Hotel.Our travelers pay us for merchant hotel
transactions prior to departing on their trip, generally when they book the reservation. We record the payment in deferred merchant bookings until the stay occurs, at which point we record the revenue. In certain nonrefundable, nonchangeable
transactions where we have no significant post-delivery obligations, we record revenue when the traveler completes the transaction on our website, less a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations based on historical experience. Amounts received from
customers are presented net of amounts paid to suppliers. In certain instances when a supplier invoices us for less than the cost we accrued, we generally recognize those amounts as revenue six months in arrears, net of an allowance, when we
determine it is not probable that we will be required to pay the supplier, based on historical experience and contract terms.

We generally contract in advance with lodging providers to obtain access to room allotments at wholesale rates. Certain contracts specifically identify the number of potential rooms and the negotiated rate of the rooms to which we may have
access over the terms of the contracts, which generally range from one to three years. Other contracts are not specific with respect to the number of rooms and the rates of the rooms to which we may have access over the terms of the contracts. In
either case we may return unbooked hotel room allotments with no obligation to the lodging providers within a period specified in each contract. For hotel rooms that are cancelled by the traveler after the specified period of time, we charge the
traveler a cancellation fee or penalty that is equal to the amount a hotel may invoice us for the cancellation.

Merchant
Air.Generally, we determine the ticket price for merchant air transactions. We generally pay the cost of the airline ticket within a few weeks after booking. We record cash paid by the traveler as deferred merchant
bookings and the cost of the airline ticket as prepaid merchant bookings. When the flight occurs, we record the difference between the deferred merchant bookings and the prepaid merchant bookings as revenue on a net basis.

When we have nonrefundable and generally noncancelable merchant air transactions, with no significant post-delivery obligations, we record
revenue upon booking. We record a reserve for chargebacks and cancellations at the time of the transaction based on historical experience.

Agency Air, Hotel, Car and Cruise.Our agency revenue comes from airline ticket transactions, certain hotel transactions as well as cruise and car rental reservations. We
record agency revenue on air transactions when the traveler books the transaction, as we have no significant post-delivery obligations. We generally record agency revenue on hotel reservations when the stay occurs. We record agency revenue on cruise
and car rental reservations either on an accrual basis for payments from a commission clearinghouse, or on receipt of commissions from an individual supplier. We record an allowance for cancellations and chargebacks on this revenue based on
historical experience.

Packages.Packages assembled by travelers through the packaging model on
our websites include a merchant hotel component and some combination of an air, car or destination services component. The individual package components are recognized in accordance with our revenue recognition policies stated above.

Click-Through Fees.We record revenue from click-through fees charged to our travel partners for traveler leads
sent to the travel partners’ websites. We record revenue from click-through fees after the traveler makes the click-through to the related travel partners’ websites.

Advertising.We record advertising revenue ratably over the advertising period or upon delivery of advertising
impressions, depending on the terms of the advertising contract.

Other.We record revenue from
all other sources either upon delivery or when we provide the service.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



Cash and Cash Equivalents

Our cash and cash equivalents include cash and liquid financial instruments with maturities of 90 days or less when purchased.

Short-term Investments

Our short-term investments consist of time deposits with financial institutions held by eLong with maturities greater than 90 days but less than one year.

Accounts Receivable

Accounts receivable are generally due within thirty days and are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. We consider accounts outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms as past due.
We determine our allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, previous loss history, a specific customer’s ability to pay its obligations to us, and the condition of the
general economy and industry as a whole.

Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $5 million and $16 million in redemptions of money market holdings due from the Reserve Primary
Fund (the “Fund”), which has been liquidating since the fourth quarter of 2008. As of December 31, 2009, we had received $75 million, of the original $80 million we reclassified from cash and cash equivalents to prepaid expenses
and other current assets during 2008. In January 2010, we received a $5 million distribution from the Fund.

Property
and Equipment

We record property and equipment at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. We also
capitalize certain costs incurred related to the development of internal use software. We capitalize costs incurred during the application development stage related to the development of internal use software. We expense costs incurred related to
the planning and post-implementation phases of development as incurred.

We compute depreciation using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is three to five years for computer equipment, capitalized software development and furniture and other equipment. We amortize leasehold improvement using the straight-line method, over the
shorter of the estimated useful life of the improvement or the remaining term of the lease.

We establish assets and
liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to return certain of our leased facilities to their original condition under the authoritative accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations. Such assets are depreciated over the
lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated restoration costs.

Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets

Goodwill is assigned to reporting
units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination as of the acquisition date. We assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, neither of which is amortized, for impairment annually as of October 1, or
more frequently, if events and circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred. See Note 5—Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net for discussion of impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived assets in 2008.



F-11




Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



In the evaluation of goodwill for impairment, we first compare the fair value of the
reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is potentially impaired and we proceed to step two of the impairment analysis. In step two of the analysis,
we will record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill over its implied fair value should such a circumstance arise.

We generally base our measurement of fair value of reporting units on a blended analysis of the present value of future discounted cash flows
and market valuation approach. The discounted cash flows model indicates the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that we expect the reporting units to generate in the future. Our significant estimates in
the discounted cash flows model include: our weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a
comparison of the Company to comparable publicly traded firms in similar lines of business. Our significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying similar companies with comparable business factors such as size, growth,
profitability, risk and return on investment and assessing comparable revenue and operating income multiples in estimating the fair value of the reporting units.

We believe the weighted use of discounted cash flows and market approach is the best method for determining the fair value of our reporting units because these are the most common valuation methodologies
used within the travel and internet industries; and the blended use of both models compensates for the inherent risks associated with either model if used on a stand-alone basis.

In addition to measuring the fair value of our reporting units as described above, we consider the combined carrying and fair values of our
reporting units in relation to the Company’s total fair value of equity plus debt as of the assessment date. Our equity value assumes our fully diluted market capitalization, using either the stock price on the valuation date or the average
stock price over a range of dates around the valuation date, plus an estimated acquisition premium which is based on observable transactions of comparable companies. The debt value is based on the highest value expected to be paid to repurchase the
debt, which can be fair value, principal or principal plus a premium depending on the terms of each debt instrument.

In the
evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets over their fair value. We base our measurement of fair value of indefinite-lived intangible
assets, which primarily consist of trade name and trademarks, using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes that the trade name and trademarks have value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for
the benefits received from them.

Recoverability of Intangible Assets with Definite Lives and Other Long-Lived Assets

Intangible assets with definite lives and other long-lived assets are carried at cost and are amortized on a
straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of two to twelve years. We review the carrying value of long-lived assets or asset groups, including property and equipment, to be used in operations whenever events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Factors that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a significant adverse change in
legal factors or the business climate that could affect the value of the asset, or a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, among others. If such facts indicate a potential impairment, we would assess the recoverability of
an asset group by determining if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets over the remaining economic life of the primary
asset in the asset group. If the recoverability test indicates that the carrying value of the asset group is not recoverable, we will estimate the fair value of the asset group using appropriate valuation methodologies which would typically



F-12




Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



include an estimate of discounted cash flows. Any impairment would be measured as the difference between the asset groups carrying amount and its estimated fair value. See
Note 5—Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net for discussion of impairment of other long-lived assets in 2008.

Assets held for sale, to the extent we have any, are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell.

Long-term Investments

We record investments using the equity method when we have the ability to
exercise significant influence over the investee. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of investments and record a write-down to fair value if a decline in value is determined to be other-than-temporary.

Income Taxes

We record income taxes under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our estimation of the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for book and tax
purposes. We determine deferred income taxes based on the differences in accounting methods and timing between financial statement and income tax reporting. Accordingly, we determine the deferred tax asset or liability for each temporary difference
based on the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when we realize the underlying items of income and expense. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent
earnings experience by jurisdiction, expectations of future taxable income, and the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, as well as other relevant factors. We may establish a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax
assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized. Due to inherent complexities arising from the nature of our businesses, future changes in income tax law, tax sharing agreements or variances between our actual and anticipated
operating results, we make certain judgments and estimates. Therefore, actual income taxes could materially vary from these estimates.

On January 1, 2007, we adopted authoritative guidance issued by the FASB related to uncertain tax positions. This guidance relates to the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken
in a tax return, and requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position, if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination, based on the technical merits of the position.

Occupancy Tax

Some states and localities impose a transient occupancy or accommodation tax on the use or occupancy of hotel accommodations. Generally, hotels charge taxes based on the room rate paid to the hotel and
remit these taxes to the various tax authorities. When a customer books a room through one of our travel services, we collect a tax recovery charge from the customer which we pay to the hotel. We do not collect or remit occupancy taxes, nor do we
pay occupancy taxes to the hotel operator on the portion of the customer payment we retain. Some jurisdictions have questioned our practice in this regard. While the applicable tax provisions vary among the jurisdictions, we generally believe that
we are not required to collect and remit such occupancy taxes. We are engaged in discussions with tax authorities in various jurisdictions to resolve this issue. Some tax authorities have brought lawsuits or have levied assessments asserting that we
are required to collect and remit occupancy tax. The ultimate resolution in all jurisdictions cannot be determined at this time. We have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes when determined to
be probable and estimable. See Note 14—Commitment and Contingencies for further discussion.

Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



Presentation of Taxes in the Income Statement

We present taxes that we collect from customers and remit to government authorities on a net basis in our consolidated statements of
operations.

Derivative Instruments

Derivative instruments are carried at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The fair values of the derivative financial instruments
generally represent the estimated amounts we would expect to receive or pay upon termination of the contracts as of the reporting date.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our derivative instruments primarily consisted of foreign currency forward contracts. These instruments are typically short-term and, as they do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, we classify the
changes in their fair value in other, net. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Through the third quarter of 2008, we had designated cross currency swap agreements as cash flow hedges of certain inter-company loan agreements denominated in currencies other than the lending subsidiaries’ functional currency (the
“hedged items”). During the third quarter of 2008, we terminated our cross-currency swap agreements for a cost of $17 million and concurrently capitalized the underlying intercompany loans. As a result of these transactions, we
recognized a net gain of less than $1 million. The fair values of our cross-currency swaps were determined using Level 2 valuation techniques and were based on the present value of net future cash payments and receipts, which fluctuated
based on changes in market interest rates and the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate, and the hedges were determined to be highly effective, at designation and up until settlement during the third quarter of 2008. As such, we recorded the total
change in the fair value of the hedges in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) each period, and concurrently reclassified a portion of the gain or loss to other, net to perfectly offset gains or losses related to transactional remeasurement
of the hedged items.

Foreign Currency Translation and Transaction Gains and Losses

Certain of our operations outside of the United States use the related local currency as their functional currency. We translate revenue and
expense at average rates of exchange during the period. We translate assets and liabilities at the rates of exchange as of the consolidated balance sheet dates and include foreign currency translation gains and losses as a component of accumulated
OCI. Due to the nature of our operations and our corporate structure, we also have subsidiaries that have significant transactions in foreign currencies other than their functional currency. We record transaction gains and losses in our consolidated
statements of operations related to the recurring remeasurement and settlement of such transactions.

To the extent
practicable, we attempt to minimize this exposure by maintaining natural hedges between our current assets and current liabilities of similarly denominated foreign currencies. Additionally, during 2008, we began using foreign currency forward
contracts to economically hedge certain merchant revenue exposures and in lieu of holding certain foreign currency cash and accounts receivable for the purpose of economically hedging our foreign currency-denominated operating liabilities. Valuation
of the foreign currency forward contracts is based on foreign currency exchange rates in active markets (a Level 2 input). As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had a net forward asset of less than $1 million recorded in prepaid
expenses and other current assets and a net forward liability of $1 million recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. We recorded $32 million in net gains and $56 million in net losses from foreign currency forward contracts during
2009 and 2008.

Debt Issuance Costs

We defer costs we incur to issue debt and amortize these costs to interest expense over the term of the debt or, when the debt can be
redeemed at the option of the holders, over the term of the redemption option.

Marketing Promotions

We periodically provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage booking of travel products and services. Generally, our incentive
offers are as follows:

Current Discount Offers.These promotions include dollar off discounts to
be applied against current purchases. We record the discounts as reduction in revenue at the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.

Inducement Offers.These promotions include discounts granted at the time of a current purchase to be applied against a future qualifying purchase. We treat inducement offers
as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We allocate the discount amount between the current purchase and the potential future purchase based on our expected relative value of the transactions. We estimate our redemption
rates using our historical experience for similar inducement offers.

Concession Offers.These
promotions include discounts to be applied against a future purchase to maintain customer satisfaction. Upon issuance, we record these concession offers as a reduction to revenue based on estimated future redemption rates. We estimate our redemption
rates using our historical experience for concession offers.

Loyalty and Points Based
Offers.We offer certain internally administered traveler loyalty programs to our customers, such as our hotels.com welcomerewards program. Welcomerewards offers travelers one free night at any hotels.com partner
property after that traveler stays 10 nights, subject to certain restrictions. As travelers accumulate points towards free travel products, we record a liability for the estimated future cost of redemptions. We determine the future redemption
obligation based on judgment factors including: (i) the estimated cost of travel products to be redeemed, and (ii) an estimated redemption rate based on the overall accumulation and usage of points towards free travel products, which is
determined through current and historical trends as well as statistical modeling techniques.

Advertising
Expense

We incur advertising expense consisting of offline costs, including television and radio advertising, and
online advertising expense to promote our brands. We expense the production costs associated with advertisements in the period in which the advertisement first takes place. We expense the costs of communicating the advertisement (e.g., television
airtime) as incurred each time the advertisement is shown. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, our advertising expense was $543 million, $598 million and $539 million. As of both December 31, 2009 and 2008,
we had $10 million of prepaid marketing expenses included in prepaid expenses and other current assets.

Stock-Based Compensation

We measure and amortize the fair value of stock options and restricted stock
units (“RSUs”) as follows:

Stock Options.We measure the value of stock options issued
or modified, including unvested options assumed in acquisitions, on the grant date (or modification or acquisition dates, if applicable) at fair value, using the Black-Scholes option valuation model. The Black-Scholes model incorporates various
assumptions including



F-15




Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



expected volatility, expected term and risk-free interest rates. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our common stock and other relevant factors. We base our expected
term assumptions on our historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock awards granted to employees. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, over the remaining vesting term on a straight-line basis. The majority
of our stock options vest over four years.

Restricted Stock Units.RSUs are stock awards that
are granted to employees entitling the holder to shares of common stock as the award vests, typically over a five-year period. We measure the value of RSUs at fair value based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock
at the date of grant. We amortize the fair value, net of estimated forfeitures, as stock-based compensation expense over the vesting term on a straight-line basis. We record RSUs that may be settled by the holder in cash, rather than shares, as a
liability and we remeasure these instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Upon settlement of these awards, our total compensation expense recorded over the vesting period of the awards will equal the settlement amount, which is
based on our stock price on the settlement date.

Performance-based RSUs vest upon achievement of certain company-based
performance conditions. On the date of grant, we determine the fair value of the performance-based award based on the fair value of our common stock at that time and we assess whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved. If
assessed as probable, we record compensation expense for these awards over the estimated performance period using the accelerated method. At each reporting period, we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance
period required to meet those targets. The estimation of whether the performance targets will be achieved and of the performance period required to achieve the targets requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ
from our current estimates, the cumulative effect on current and prior periods of those changes will be recorded in the period estimates are revised, or the change in estimate will be applied prospectively depending on whether the change affects the
estimate of total compensation cost to be recognized or merely affects the period over which compensation cost is to be recognized. The ultimate number of shares issued and the related compensation expense recognized will be based on a comparison of
the final performance metrics to the specified targets.

Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future
events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive these awards, and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of our original estimates of fair value. In determining the estimated forfeiture rates for stock-based
awards, we periodically conduct an assessment of the actual number of equity awards that have been forfeited to date as well as those expected to be forfeited in the future. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including
the type of award, the employee class and historical experience. The estimate of stock awards that will ultimately be forfeited requires significant judgment and to the extent that actual results or updated estimates differ from our current
estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised.

Earnings
Per Share

We compute basic earnings per share by taking net income (loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc. available to
common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common and Class B common shares outstanding during the period excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. Diluted earnings per share include the potential dilution that
could occur from stock-based awards and other stock-based commitments using the treasury stock or the as if converted methods, as applicable. For additional information on how we compute earnings per share, see Note 11 — Earnings Per
Share.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments reported on our
consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value as we maintain them with various high-quality financial institutions. The accounts receivable are short-term in nature and are generally settled shortly after the sale.

Certain Risks and Concentrations

Our business is subject to certain risks and concentrations including dependence on relationships with travel suppliers, primarily airlines and hotels, dependence on third-party technology providers,
exposure to risks associated with online commerce security and credit card fraud. We also rely on global distribution system partners and third-party service providers for certain fulfillment services, including one third-party service provider for
which we accounted for approximately 36% of its total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 and approximately 43% of its total revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.

Financial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. We
maintain some cash and cash equivalents balances with financial institutions that are in excess of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily composed of government and prime institutional
money market funds as well as bank (both interest and non-interest bearing) account balances denominated in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, euros and British pound sterling.

Contingent Liabilities

We have a number of regulatory and legal matters outstanding, as discussed further in Note 14 — Commitments and Contingencies. Periodically, we review the status of all significant
outstanding matters to assess the potential financial exposure. When (i) it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated, we record the estimated
loss in our consolidated statements of operations. We provide disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for loss contingencies that do not meet both these conditions if there is a reasonable possibility that a loss may have
been incurred that would be material to the financial statements. Significant judgment is required to determine the probability that a liability has been incurred and whether such liability is reasonably estimable. We base accruals made on the best
information available at the time which can be highly subjective. The final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

New Accounting Pronouncements

In June 2009, the FASB issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The new guidance requires revised
evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this guidance will
have on our consolidated financial statements.

In October 2009, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition to require
companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an element’s estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. This guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2011
with earlier application permitted. We are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.



F-17




Expedia, Inc.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — (Continued)



In January 2010, the FASB issued guidance that requires reporting entities to make new
disclosures about recurring or nonrecurring fair-value measurements including significant transfers into and out of Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements and information on purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis in the
reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2009, except for Level 3 reconciliation disclosures that are effective for annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2010. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 3 — Acquisitions and Other Investments

In 2009, we acquired a China-based metasearch
company as well as a controlling interest in a company we initially invested in during 2007 (see additional disclosure below). The purchase price of these companies totaled $42 million, which was paid in cash during the year. As a result of
these acquisitions, we acquired $7 million in cash and minimal net assets and recorded $52 million in goodwill, $24 million of intangible assets with definite lives with a weighted average amortization life of 6.6 years, and $15 million in
noncontrolling interest. In addition, during 2009, we paid $10 million of contingent purchase consideration under prior acquisitions as well as other acquisition related-costs.

The purchase price allocation of these acquisitions is preliminary for up to 12 months after the acquisition dates and subject to revision,
and any change to the fair value of net assets acquired will lead to a corresponding change to the purchase price allocable to goodwill on a retroactive basis. The results of operations of each of the acquired businesses have been included in our
consolidated results from each transaction closing date forward; their effect on consolidated revenue and operating income during 2009 was not significant.

In 2008, we acquired four online travel media content companies, one corporate travel company and two online travel product and service companies, which includes Venere, an online travel provider based in
Italy that focuses on hotel reservations under an agency model. The purchase price of these companies as well as contingent purchase consideration under prior acquisitions and other acquisition-related costs totaled $475 million, of which
$465 million was paid in cash and $10 million was accrued as of December 31, 2008. The results of operations of each of the acquired businesses have been included in our consolidated results from each transaction closing date forward;
their effect on consolidated revenue and operating loss during 2008 was not significant. The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price for all acquisitions made in 2008, in thousands:

(1)Acquired intangible assets primarily consist of supplier relationship assets with a weighted average life of 10.6 years and technology assets with a weighted
average life of 3 years. In total, the weighted average life of acquired intangible assets was 8.3 years.

In one of the 2008 transactions, we acquired a 74% controlling interest with certain rights whereby we may acquire, and the minority shareholders may sell to us, the additional shares of the company at fair value at various times through
2011. In another of the 2008 transactions, we acquired an 86% controlling interest with certain rights whereby we may acquire, and the minority shareholders may sell to us, the additional shares of the company at fair value, or at an adjusted fair
value at our option, during a 30-day period beginning October 1, 2012. Future changes in fair value of the shares for which the minority holders may sell to us above the initial

noncontrolling interest basis will be recorded to the noncontrolling interest, classified in other long-term liabilities, and as charges or credits to retained earnings (or additional paid-in
capital in the absence of retained earnings). During 2009, we recorded $8 million related to the change in fair value of redeemable noncontrolling interests. The fair value was determined based on various valuation techniques, including market
comparables and discounted cash flow projections (Level 3 inputs).

In 2007, we acquired three travel-related companies. The
purchase price of these and other acquisition related costs totaled $152 million, $60 million of which we paid in cash and $92 million of which was accrued at December 31, 2007 as a result of the financial performance of one of
the acquired companies during 2007. As a result of these acquisitions, we recorded $126 million in goodwill and $18 million of intangible assets with definite lives. The results of operations of each of the acquired businesses have been
included in our consolidated results from each transaction closing date forward; their effect on consolidated net revenue and operating income during 2007 was not significant. The December 31, 2007 accrued purchase consideration represented
$92 million of $100 million total additional purchase price that could be achieved based on the annual results of 2007 or 2008, or the two periods combined. Based on the 2007 and 2008 annual results of the acquiree, we ultimately paid the
total additional achievable purchase price of $100 million, $93 million of which was paid in 2008 and $7 million of which was paid in 2009.

During 2007, we also acquired a 50% ownership interest in a travel company for $26 million in cash. We included this investment in long-term investments and other assets and accounted for it under
the equity-method. In 2009, we acquired an additional interest for $3 million in cash, which was included within the 2009 total purchase price above, and resulted in a 60% majority ownership interest and our consolidation of this entity. In
conjunction with our acquisition of additional interest, we remeasured our previously held equity interest to fair value and recognized a loss of $5 million in other, net during the period. The fair value of the 40% noncontrolling interest in the
company was estimated to be $15 million at the time of acquisition. Both fair value assessments were determined based on various valuation techniques, including market comparables and discounted cash flow projections (Level 3 inputs). Our investment
agreement contains certain rights, whereby we may acquire and the investee may sell to us the additional shares of the company, at fair value or at established multiples of future earnings at our discretion, during the first quarter of 2011 and
2013. As the noncontrolling interest is redeemable at the option of the minority holders, we classified the balance as an other long-term liability.

NOTE 5 — Goodwill and
Intangible Assets, Net

Impairment Assessments.We perform our annual assessment
of possible impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets as of October 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. As of October 1, 2009, we had no impairments.

We measured the fair value of each of our reporting units and
both our indefinite-lived and definite lived intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques as described above in Note 2 — Significant Accounting Policies. The significant estimates used included our weighted average cost of
capital, long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business, and working capital effects. Our assumptions were based on the actual historical performance of each of the reporting units and take into account the recent weakening of operating
results and implied risk premiums based on market prices of our equity and debt as of the assessment date. To validate the reasonableness of the reporting unit fair values, we reconciled the aggregate fair values of the reporting units determined in
step one to the enterprise market capitalization. Enterprise market capitalization includes, among other factors, the fully diluted market capitalization of our stock, an acquisition premium based on historical data from acquisitions within the same
or similar industries and the appropriate redemption values of our debt. In performing the reconciliation we may, depending on the volatility of the market value of our stock price, use either the stock price on the valuation date or the average
stock price over a range of dates around that date and

consider such other quantitative and qualitative factors we consider relevant, which may change depending on the date for which the assessment is made. This assessment resulted in the recognition
in the fourth quarter of 2008 of a loss on impairment of long-term assets of approximately $3 billion, which consists of $2.8 billion of goodwill and $223 million of indefinite-lived trade names. A deferred tax benefit of
$189 million was recognized as a result of these charges. Of the $2.8 billion goodwill impairment charge in 2008, $2.0 billion related to our North America segment, $759 million to our Europe segment and $21 million in our Asia
Pacific segment based on our segments for the year ended December 31, 2008. Based on our new segments for 2009, $2.5 billion of the goodwill impairment would have related to our Leisure segment and $282 million to our TripAdvisor Media Network
segment. Of the $223 million indefinite-lived trade name impairment charge in 2008, $128 million related to trade names in our North America segment, $73 million in our Europe segment and $22 million in our Asia Pacific segment
based on our segments for the year ended December 31, 2008. Based on our new segments for 2009, all such impairments would have related to our Leisure segment.

We determined that the adverse change in the business climate discussed above was also an indicator requiring the testing of our long-lived assets for recoverability and performed this test as of
December 1, 2008. We tested the long-lived assets of our reporting units for recoverability based on a comparison of the respective aggregate values of their undiscounted cash flows to the respective carrying values. The results of the
evaluation indicated that the carrying values of the related assets were recoverable. In addition to the above impairment analysis, during the fourth quarter of 2008, we wrote off $11 million related to capitalized software costs based on the
abandonment of the related project.

7.456% Notes, at 100% of the principal amount plus accrued interest. We may redeem the 7.456% Notes in accordance with the terms of the agreement, in whole or in part at any time at our
option.

Based on quoted market prices, the fair value of our 7.456% Notes was approximately $546 million and
$365 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the fair value of the 8.5% Notes was approximately $431 million and $280 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

The 7.456% and 8.5% Notes are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed by certain domestic Expedia subsidiaries and rank equally in right
of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated obligations. For further information, see Note 19 — Guarantor and Non-Guarantor Supplemental Financial Information. Accrued interest related to the 7.456% and
8.5% Notes was $31 million and $32 million as of December 31, 2009 and 2008.

Credit Facility

As of December 31, 2009, Expedia, Inc. maintained a $1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of
lenders, which was unconditionally guaranteed by certain Expedia subsidiaries and was expected to expire in August 2010. There were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2008, the $650 million carrying
amount of the borrowing approximated its fair value. The facility bore interest based on market interest rates plus a spread, which was determined based on our financial leverage. The interest rate was 1.34% as of December 31, 2008.
During 2009, we amended our credit facility to replace a tangible net worth covenant with a minimum interest coverage covenant, among other changes. As part of this amendment, our leverage ratio was tightened, pricing on our borrowings
increased by 200 basis points and we paid approximately $6 million in fees. The annual fee to maintain the facility ranged from 0.4% to 0.5% on the unused portion of the facility, or approximately $4 million to $5 million if all
of the facility was unused. In addition to the minimum interest coverage covenant, the facility also contained a leverage ratio financial covenant.

The amount of stand-by letters of credit (“LOC”) issued under the facility reduced the amount available to us. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, there were $42 million and
$58 million of outstanding stand-by LOCs issued under the facility.

In February 2010, we reached agreement on a new $750
million, three-year unsecured revolving credit facility, replacing our prior credit facility. Pricing is based on the Company’s credit ratings, with drawn amounts bearing interest at LIBOR plus 300 basis points, and undrawn amounts bearing
interest at 50 basis points. Financial covenants remain the same under the new facility. We incurred approximately $8 million in fees, which will be amortized over the life of the credit facility. As of February 11, 2010, we had no borrowings
outstanding under the facility.

NOTE 7 — Employee Benefit Plans

Our U.S. employees are generally eligible to participate in a retirement and savings plan that qualifies under Section 401(k) of
the Internal Revenue Code. Participating employees may contribute up to 50% of their pretax salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of
3% of a participant’s earnings. Our contribution vests with the employee after the employee completes two years of service. Participating employees have the option to invest in our common stock, but there is no requirement for participating
employees to invest their contribution or our matching contribution in our common stock. We also have various defined contribution plans for our international employees. Our contributions to these benefit plans were $11 million,
$12 million and $9 million for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

options as our primary form of stock-based compensation. During 2008, we also granted stock options to certain key employees. The fair value of stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 was estimated at the date of
grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, assuming no dividends and the following weighted average assumptions:

In 2007, our Chairman and Senior Executive exercised options to purchase
9.5 million shares. 2.3 million shares were withheld and concurrently cancelled by the Company to cover the exercise price of $8.59 per share and 3.5 million shares were withheld and concurrently cancelled to cover tax obligations,
with a net delivery of 3.7 million shares.

RSUs, which are stock awards that are granted to employees entitling the holder to
shares of our common stock as the award vests, were our primary form of stock-based award prior to 2009. We record RSUs that will settle in cash as a liability and we remeasure them to fair value at the end of each reporting period. These awards
that settle in cash and the resulting liability are insignificant. Our RSUs generally vest over five years, but may accelerate in certain circumstances, including certain changes in control.

achievement of performance targets.

In 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized total stock-based compensation expense of
$62 million, $61 million and $63 million. The total income tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense was $20 million, $21 million and $22 million for 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Cash received from stock-based award exercises for the years ended December 31,
2009 and 2008 was $16 million and $6 million. Our employees that held IAC vested stock options prior to the Spin-Off received vested stock options in both Expedia and IAC. As these stock options are exercised, we receive a tax deduction.
Total current income tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 associated with the exercise of IAC and Expedia stock-based awards held by our employees were $10 million and $19 million, of which we recorded less
than $1 million in 2009 and approximately $2 million in 2008 as a reduction of goodwill.

As of December 31, 2009,
there was approximately $98 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested stock-based awards, which is expected to be recognized in expense over a weighted-average period of
2.67 years.

We have fully vested stock warrants with expiration dates through May 2012 outstanding. Each stock warrant is
exercisable for a certain number of shares of our common stock or a fraction thereof. We also had certain warrants which were traded on the NASDAQ under the symbols “EXPEW” and “EXPEZ” until their expiration on February 4,

For all periods presented, we have computed current and deferred tax expense using our
stand-alone effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2009, our current income tax payable represents amounts that we will pay to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities based on our taxable income.

We reduced our current income tax payable by $10 million, $19 million and $121 million for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007, for tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation. We recorded less than $1 million for 2009, $2 million for 2008 and $9 million for 2007 of the related income tax benefits of this stock-based compensation as
a reduction of goodwill.

The tax effect of cumulative temporary differences and net operating losses that give rise to our
deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 are as follows:

At December 31, 2009, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss
carryforwards (“NOLs”) of approximately $8 million, $23 million and $88 million. If not utilized, the federal and state NOLs will expire at various times between 2010 and 2029, $81 million foreign NOLs can be carried
forward indefinitely, and $7 million foreign NOLs will expire at various times between 2010 and 2029.

At
December 31, 2009, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $46 million related to the portion of net operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will not be realized. This
amount represented an increase of approximately $14 million over the amount recorded as of December 31, 2008 and was primarily attributable to an increase in foreign operating losses.

We have not provided deferred U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we intend to reinvest
permanently outside of the United States; the total amount of such earnings as of December 31, 2009 was $72 million. Should we distribute earnings of foreign subsidiaries in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to U.S. income
taxes. Due to complexities in tax laws and various assumptions that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amount of unrecognized deferred U.S. taxes on these earnings.

A reconciliation of total income tax expense to the amounts computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to income before
income taxes is as follows:

During 2009, we recorded a tax benefit of $23 million related to a worthless stock
deduction associated with the closure of a foreign subsidiary.

By virtue of the previously filed separate company and
consolidated income tax returns filed with IAC, we are routinely under audit by federal, state, local and foreign authorities. These audits include questioning the timing and the amount of income and deductions and the allocation of income among
various tax jurisdictions. Annual tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from the examination of prior year returns. We are no longer subject to tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to
1998.

(1)As of December 31, 2009, we had $191million of unrecognized tax benefits, of which $190 million is classified as long-term and included in other
long-term liabilities.

Included in the balance at December 31, 2009 and 2008 were $46 million and
$68 million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions that, if recognized, would decrease our provision for income taxes. Also included in the balance at December 31, 2009 were $128 million, of which $6 million and
$3 million was added in 2009 and 2008, of excess tax benefits that resulted from our Chairman and Senior Executive’s exercises of stock options during 2007 and 2005. If the IRS were to make a final determination that IAC and not Expedia
were entitled to such deductions, then under the terms of our tax sharing agreement, IAC would pay to Expedia an amount equal to any such tax benefit at such time as it were actually realized by IAC. Therefore, an unfavorable outcome related to this
position would not materially impact our cash flows.

We recognize interest and penalties related to our liabilities for
uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had approximately $24 million accrued for both periods for the potential payment of estimated interest and penalties. During the years ended
December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recognized approximately $(1) million, $12 million and $4 million of interest (income) expense, net of federal benefit and penalties, related to our liabilities for uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 10 — Stockholders’ Equity

Common Stock and Class B Common Stock

Our authorized common
stock consists of 1.6 billion shares of common stock with par value of $0.001 per share, and 400 million shares of Class B common stock with par value of $0.001 per share. Both classes of common stock qualify for and share equally in
dividends, if declared by our Board of Directors, and generally vote together on all matters. Common stock is entitled to one vote per share and Class B common stock is entitled to 10 votes per share. Holders of common stock, voting as a
single, separate class are entitled to elect 25% of the total number of directors. Class B common stockholders may, at any time, convert their shares into common stock, on a one for one share basis. Upon conversion, the Class B common
stock is retired and is not available for reissue. In the event of liquidation, dissolution, distribution of assets or winding-up of Expedia, Inc., the holders of both classes of common stock have equal rights to receive all the assets of Expedia,
Inc. after the rights of the holders of the preferred stock have been satisfied.

Preferred Stock

Our preferred stock has a face value of $22.23 per share; each share is entitled to an annual dividend of 1.99%. Each preferred stockholder
is entitled to two votes per share. Preferred stockholders may, at certain times through 2017, elect to have their shares redeemed or elect to convert their shares into common stock based upon formulas described in the related Certificate of
Designations of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock of Expedia, Inc. Beginning February 4, 2012, we may redeem the preferred stock for cash or common stock. On February 4, 2022, all outstanding shares of preferred stock
automatically convert into common stock.

Share Repurchases

During 2007, we completed two tender offers pursuant to which we acquired 30 million tendered shares of our common stock at a purchase
price of $22.00 per share and 25 million tendered shares of our common stock at $29.00 per share, for a total cost of $1.4 billion plus fees and expenses relating to the tender offers.

We currently have authorization, for which there is no fixed termination date, from our Board of Directors to repurchase up to
20 million outstanding shares of our common stock; no such repurchases have been made under this authorization as of February 11, 2010. The number of shares we may repurchase under this authorization is subject to certain of our debt
covenants.

Dividends on our Common Stock

On February 10, 2010, the Executive Committee, acting on behalf of the Board of Directors, declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per
share of outstanding common stock, the first dividend in our history. Future declarations of dividends are subject to final determination of our Board of Directors.

NOTE 11 — Earnings Per Share

Basic Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share was calculated for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 using the weighted average number of common and Class B common shares outstanding during the period
excluding restricted stock and stock held in escrow. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had 751 shares of preferred stock outstanding, the impact of which on our earnings per share calculation is immaterial.

Diluted Earnings Per Share

For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we computed diluted earnings per share using (i) the number of shares of common stock and Class B common stock used in the basic
earnings per share calculation as indicated above (ii) if dilutive, the incremental common stock that we would issue upon the assumed exercise of stock options and stock warrants and the vesting of RSUs using the treasury stock method, and
(iii) other stock-based commitments.

The following table presents our basic and diluted net income (loss) per share:



Year Ended December 31,200920082007(In thousands, except per share data)Net income (loss) attributable to Expedia, Inc.$299,526$(2,517,763)$295,864Earnings per share attributable to Expedia, Inc. available to common stockholders:Basic$1.04$(8.80)$1.00Diluted1.03(8.80)0.94Weighted average number of shares outstanding:Basic288,214286,167296,640Dilutive effect of:Options to purchase common stock2,842—7,384Warrants to purchase common stock92—7,574Other dilutive securities993—2,635Diluted292,141286,167314,233

As we recorded a net loss for 2008, we have revised our diluted earnings per share
amounts for that period to exclude the impacts of common stock equivalents, as they are antidilutive. Thus, basic and diluted earnings per share for 2008 are equal.

The earnings per share amounts are the same for common stock and Class B common stock because the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends
or in liquidation.

NOTE 12 — Restructuring Charges

In conjunction with the reorganization of our business around our global brands, and the resulting centralization of locations and brand
management, marketing and administrative personnel as well as certain customer operations centers, we recognized $34 million in restructuring charges during the year ended December 31, 2009. Restructuring charges related to our brand
reorganization were substantially completed by the end of 2009.

In 2009, in conjunction with the acquisition of additional interest in one of our
equity method investments, we remeasured our previously held equity interest to fair value and recognized the resulting loss of $5 million.

In 2008, in connection with the closing of an acquisition and the related holding of euros to economically hedge the purchase price, we recognized a net loss of $21 million, included in foreign
exchange rate losses, net.

As a result of the Spin-Off, we assumed certain obligations of IAC related to IAC’s Ask Jeeves
Notes. When holders of the Ask Jeeves Notes converted their notes, they received shares of both IAC and Expedia common stock. Under the terms of the Spin-Off, we were obligated to issue shares of our common stock to IAC for delivery to the holders
of the Ask Jeeves Notes, or pay cash in equal value, in lieu of issuing such shares, at our option. This obligation represented a derivative liability on our consolidated balance sheet because it was not indexed solely to shares of our common stock.
We recorded the fair value of this derivative obligation on our consolidated balance sheets with any changes in fair value recorded in our consolidated statements of operations in other, net. The estimated fair value of this liability fluctuated
primarily based on changes in the price of our common stock. In 2008, the remainder of these notes converted and we released approximately 0.5 million shares of our common stock with a fair value of $11 million to satisfy the final
conversion requirements. In 2008 and 2007, we recognized net gains (losses) of $4 million and $(5) million related to these Ask Jeeves Notes. As of June 1, 2008, we had no further obligations related to the Ask Jeeves Notes.

In 2007, we recorded refunds based on notification from the IRS totaling $15 million related to Federal Excise Tax (“FET”)
taxes remitted to the IRS but not collected from customers for airline ticket sales by one of our subsidiaries in the third quarter of 2001 through the third quarter of 2004, plus accrued interest thereon. We recorded $3 million to revenue as
that amount relates to taxes remitted on airline ticket sales subsequent to our

acquisition of the subsidiary. We recorded $12 million to other, net for taxes remitted on airline ticket sales prior to the acquisition and total interest earned on all underlying tax
remittances.

NOTE 14 — Commitments and Contingencies

Letters of Credit, Purchase Obligations and Guarantees

We have commitments and obligations that include purchase obligations, guarantees and LOCs, which could potentially require our payment in
the event of demands by third parties or contingent events. The following table presents these commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2009:



TotalBy PeriodLess than1 year1 to 3 years3 to 5 yearsMore than5 years(In thousands)Purchase obligations$58,392$32,255$26,137$—$—Guarantees64,99864,96236——Letters of credit42,03342,033———$165,423$139,250$26,173$—$—

Our purchase obligations represent the minimum obligations we have under agreements
with certain of our vendors. These minimum obligations are less than our projected use for those periods. Payments may be more than the minimum obligations based on actual use.

We have guarantees primarily related to a specific country aviation authority for the potential non-delivery, by us, of packaged travel sold
in that country. The authority also requires that a portion of the total amount of packaged travel sold be bonded.

Our LOCs
consist of stand-by LOCs, underwritten by a group of lenders, which we primarily issue to certain hotel properties to secure our payment for hotel room transactions. The contractual expiration dates of these LOCs are shown in the table above. There
were no claims made against any stand-by LOCs during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007.

Lease
Commitments

We have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases for office space and related office
equipment for which we record the related expense on a monthly basis. Certain leases contain periodic rent escalation adjustments and renewal options. Rent expense related to such leases is recorded on a straight-line basis. Operating lease
obligations expire at various dates with the latest maturity in 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded rental expense of $50 million, $49 million and $33 million.

Legal Proceedings

In the ordinary course of business, we are a party to various lawsuits. Management does not expect these lawsuits to have a material impact
on the liquidity, results of operations, or financial condition of Expedia. We also evaluate other potential contingent matters, including value-added tax, federal excise tax, transient occupancy or accommodation tax and similar matters. We do not
believe that the aggregate amount of liability that could be reasonably possible with respect to these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Securities Related Class Action Litigations.While we are not a party to the securities litigation filed
against IAC, under the terms of our separation agreement with IAC, we have generally agreed to bear a portion of the costs and liabilities, if any, associated with any securities law litigation relating to conduct prior to the Spin-Off of the
businesses or entities that comprise Expedia following the Spin-Off. This case arises out of IAC’s August 4, 2004, announcement of its earnings for the second quarter of 2004.

Litigation relating to the IAC/hotels.com merger agreement announced April 10, 2003, is pending in Delaware. The principal claim in
these actions is that the defendants breached their fiduciary duty to the plaintiffs by entering into or approving the merger agreement.

Litigation Relating to Hotel Occupancy Taxes.Fifty-five lawsuits have been filed by cities and counties involving hotel occupancy taxes. In addition, there are five pending
consumer lawsuits relating to taxes or fees. The municipality and consumer lawsuits are in various stages ranging from responding to the complaint to discovery. We continue to defend these lawsuits vigorously. To date, eighteen of the municipality
lawsuits have been dismissed. Most of these dismissals have been without prejudice and, generally, allow the municipality to seek administrative remedies prior to pursuing further litigation. Seven dismissals (Pitt County, North Carolina; City of
Madison, Wisconsin; City of Orange, Texas; Fayetteville, Arkansas: Houston, Texas; Louisville, Kentucky; and Township of Lyndhurst, New Jersey) were based on a finding that the defendants were not subject to the local hotel occupancy tax ordinance.
As a result of this litigation and other attempts by certain jurisdictions to levy such taxes, we have established a reserve for the potential settlement of issues related to hotel occupancy taxes in the amount of $21 million and
$20 million at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our reserve is based on our best estimate and the ultimate resolution of these issues may be greater or less than the liabilities recorded.

In connection with various occupancy tax audits and assessments, certain jurisdictions may assert that taxpayers are required to pay any
assessed taxes prior to being allowed to contest or litigate the applicability of the ordinances, which is referred to as “pay-to-play.” These jurisdictions may attempt to require that we pay any assessed taxes prior to being allowed to
contest or litigate the applicability of similar tax ordinances. Payment of these amounts is not an admission that we believe we are subject to such taxes and, even when such payments are made, we will continue to defend our position vigorously.
During 2009, we expensed and paid approximately $48 million to the City of San Francisco for amounts assessed for hotel occupancy tax, including penalties and interest, from January 2000 to March 2009. We paid such amounts in order to be allowed to
pursue litigation challenging whether we are required to pay hotel occupancy tax on the portion of the customer payment we retain as compensation and, if so, the actual amounts owed. We do not believe that the amounts we retain as compensation are
subject to the city’s hotel occupancy tax ordinance. If we prevail in the litigation, the city will be required to repay these amounts, plus interest. During the first quarter of 2009, the California Superior Court for Orange County determined
we are not required to make a payment in order to litigate in Anaheim, California.

Class Action
Lawsuit.We are a defendant in a class action lawsuit filed in Seattle, Washington alleging that certain practices related to our service fees breached our Terms of Use and violated Washington’s
Consumer Protection Act from 2001 through 2008. In May 2009, the court granted the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment on their breach of contract claim, without the benefit of an actual trial on the merits, and denied the

NOTE 15 — Related Party Transactions

In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into various agreements with IAC, a related party due to common ownership, to provide for an orderly transition and to govern our ongoing relationships with
IAC. These agreements include, among others, a separation agreement, a tax sharing agreement, an employee matters agreement and a transition services agreement.

In addition, in conjunction with the Spin-Off, we entered into a joint ownership and cost sharing agreement with IAC, under which IAC transferred to us 50% ownership in an airplane, which is available for
use by both companies. We share equally in capital costs; operating costs are pro-rated based on actual usage. In May 2006, the airplane was placed in service and is being depreciated over 10 years. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, the
net basis in our ownership interest was $17 million and $18 million recorded in long-term investments and other assets. In 2009 and 2008, operating and maintenance costs paid directly to the jointly-owned subsidiary for the airplane were
nominal.

On August 20, 2008, IAC completed its plan to separate into five publicly traded companies. With this
separation, our related party transactions with the newly constituted IAC have been immaterial and we expect this trend to continue on a go-forward basis.

NOTE 16 — Segment Information

Beginning in the first
quarter of 2009, we have three reportable segments: Leisure, the TripAdvisor Media Network and Egencia. The change from two reportable segments, North America and Europe, was a result of the reorganization of our business around our global brands.
We determined our segments based on how our chief operating decision makers manage our business, make operating decisions and evaluate operating performance. Our primary operating metric for evaluating segment performance is Operating Income Before
Amortization (“OIBA”). OIBA for our Leisure and Egencia segments includes allocations of certain expenses, primarily cost of revenue and facilities, and our Leisure segment includes the total costs of our Partner Services Group. We base
the allocations primarily on transaction volumes and other usage metrics; this methodology is periodically evaluated and may change. We do not allocate certain shared expenses such as accounting, human resources, information technology and legal to
our reportable segments. We include these expenses in Corporate and Eliminations.

Our Leisure segment provides a full range of
travel and advertising services to our worldwide customers through a variety of brands including: Expedia.com and hotels.com in the United States and localized Expedia

and hotels.com websites throughout the world, Expedia Affiliate Network, Hotwire.com, Venere, eLong and Classic Vacations. Our TripAdvisor Media Network segment provides advertising services to
travel suppliers on its websites, which aggregate traveler opinions and unbiased travel articles about cities, hotels, restaurants and activities in a variety of destinations through tripadvisor.com and its localized international versions, as well
as through its various travel media content properties within the TripAdvisor Media Network. Our Egencia segment provides managed travel services to corporate customers in North America, Europe, and the Asia Pacific region.

Concurrent with the change to three reportable segments, we have expanded our segment disclosure to include intersegment revenues, which
primarily consist of advertising and media services provided by our TripAdvisor Media Network segment to our Leisure segment. These intersegment transactions are recorded by each segment at estimated fair value as if the transactions were with third
parties and, therefore, impact segment performance. However, the revenue and corresponding expense are eliminated in consolidation. The elimination of such intersegment transactions is included within “Corporate and Eliminations” in the
table below.

Corporate and Eliminations also includes unallocated corporate functions and expenses. In addition, we record
amortization of intangible assets and any related impairment, as well as stock-based compensation expense, restructuring charges and other items excluded from segment operating performance in Corporate and Eliminations. Such amounts are detailed in
our segment reconciliation below.

The following tables present our segment information for the years ended December 31,
2009, 2008 and 2007. As a significant portion of our property and equipment is not allocated to our operating segments, we do not report the assets or related depreciation expense as it would not be meaningful, nor do we regularly provide such
information to our chief operating decision makers.

(1)Earnings per share is computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of the quarterly earnings per share may not equal the total computed
for the year. As we recorded a net loss for the fourth quarter of 2008, we have revised our diluted earnings per share amounts for that period to exclude the impacts of common stock equivalents, as they are antidilutive. Thus, basic and diluted
earnings per share for the fourth quarter of 2008 are equal.



(2)Included as part of operating loss and net loss attributable to Expedia, Inc. for the fourth quarter of 2008 is an approximately $3 billion impairment charge
related to goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2008 was impacted by a $7 million adjustment related to intangible amortization which should have been included in prior quarterly periods of 2008.
