OVERVIEW



Segments.We review and present our business results in two sectors:  Automotive and Financial Services.  Within these sectors, our business is divided into reportable segments based on the organizational structure that we use to evaluate performance and make decisions on resource allocation, as well as availability and materiality of separate financial results consistent with that structure.



The reportable segments within our Automotive and Financial Services sectors at December 31, 2011 were as described in the table below:

Business SectorReportable Segments (a)DescriptionAutomotive:Ford North AmericaPrimarily includes the sale of Ford- and Lincoln-brand vehicles and related service parts in North America (the United States, Canada and Mexico), together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute and service these vehicles and parts. (b)Ford South AmericaPrimarily includes the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in South America, together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute and service these vehicles and parts.Ford EuropePrimarily includes the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in Europe, Turkey and Russia, together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute and service these vehicles and parts.Ford Asia Pacific AfricaPrimarily includes the sale of Ford-brand vehicles and related service parts in the Asia Pacific region and South Africa, together with the associated costs to develop, manufacture, distribute and service these vehicles and parts.Financial Services:Ford Motor Credit CompanyPrimarily includes vehicle-related financing, leasing, and insurance.Other Financial ServicesIncludes a variety of businesses including holding companies and real estate.

__________

(a)We have experienced a number of changes to our reportable segments in recent years, including the following:

▪We discontinued the Mercury brand as of the end of 2010.

▪We sold our Volvo operations on August 2, 2010.

▪During the fourth quarter of 2008, we sold a portion of our equity in Mazda Motor Corporation ("Mazda"), reducing our ownership percentage from approximately 33.4% at the time of sale to about 11% ownership shortly thereafter.  Through a subsequent sale in the fourth quarter of 2010, we further reduced our ownership to about 3.5%.  Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2008, we have accounted for our interest in Mazda as a marketable security (instead of as an operating segment).

▪We sold our Jaguar Land Rover operations on June 2, 2008.

▪We sold Aston Martin on May 31, 2007.

(b)For periods prior to January 1, 2009, this segment also included the sale of Mazda6 vehicles produced by our then-consolidated affiliate AutoAlliance International, Inc. ("AAI").



We provide financial information (such as revenue, income, and assets) for each business sector and reportable segment in three areas of this Report:  (1) "Item 6. Selected Financial Data;" (2) "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" ("Item 7"); and (3) Note 27 of the Notes to the Financial Statements located at the end of this Report.  Financial information relating to certain geographic areas is included in Note 28 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

AUTOMOTIVE SECTOR



General



Our vehicle brands are Ford and Lincoln.  In 2011, we sold approximately 5,695,000 vehicles at wholesale throughout the world.  See Item 7 for discussion of our calculation of wholesale unit volumes.



Substantially all of our cars, trucks and parts are marketed through retail dealers in North America, and through distributors and dealers (collectively, "dealerships") outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned.  At December 31, 2011, the approximate number of dealerships worldwide distributing our vehicle brands was as follows:

BrandNumber of Dealershipsat December 31, 2011Ford10,653Ford-Lincoln (combined)907Lincoln230Total11,790



In addition to the products we sell to our dealerships for retail sale, we also sell cars and trucks to our dealerships for sale to fleet customers, including commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments.  We do not depend on any single customer or small group of customers to the extent that the loss of such customer or group of customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.



Through our dealer network and other channels, we provide retail customers with a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products, including maintenance and light repair, heavy repair, collision repair, vehicle accessories and extended service contracts.  In North America, we market these products and services under several brands, including Ford Service, Lincoln Service, Ford Custom Accessories™, Ford and Lincoln Extended Service Plans, and MotorcraftSM.



The worldwide automotive industry, Ford included, is affected significantly by general economic conditions, among other factors, over which we have little control.  This is especially so because vehicles are durable goods, which provide consumers latitude in determining whether and when to replace an existing vehicle.  The decision whether to purchase a vehicle may be affected significantly by slowing economic growth, geopolitical events, and other factors (including the cost of purchasing and operating cars and trucks and the availability and cost of credit and fuel).  As we recently have seen in the United States and Europe, in particular, the number of cars and trucks sold may vary substantially from year to year.  Further, the automotive industry is a highly competitive business that has a wide and growing variety of product offerings from a growing number of manufacturers.



Our wholesale unit volumes vary with the level of total industry demand and our share of that industry demand.  In the short term, our wholesale unit volumes also are influenced by the level of dealer inventory.  Our share is influenced by how our products are perceived in comparison to those offered by other manufacturers based on many factors, including price, quality, styling, reliability, safety, fuel efficiency, functionality, and reputation.  Our share also is affected by the timing and frequency of new model introductions.  Our ability to satisfy changing consumer preferences with respect to type or size of vehicle, as well as design and performance characteristics, impacts our sales and earnings significantly.



As with other manufacturers, the profitability of our business is affected by many factors, including:



▪Wholesale unit volumes

▪Margin of profit on each vehicle sold - which in turn is affected by many factors, such as:

•Market factors - volume and mix of vehicles and options sold, and net pricing (reflecting, among other factors, incentive programs)

•Costs of components and raw materials necessary for production of vehicles

•Costs for customer warranty claims and additional service actions

•Costs for safety, emissions and fuel economy technology and equipment

▪A high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, so that small changes in wholesale unit volumes can significantly affect overall profitability










ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



Our industry continues to face a very competitive pricing environment, driven in part by industry excess capacity, particularly in mature markets such as North America and Europe.  For the past several decades, manufacturers typically have given price discounts and other marketing incentives to maintain market share and production levels.  A discussion of our strategies to compete in this pricing environment is set forth in the "Overview" section in Item 7.



Competitive Position.The worldwide automotive industry consists of many producers, with no single dominant producer.  Certain manufacturers, however, account for the major percentage of total sales within particular countries, especially their countries of origin.  Key competitors with global presence include Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors Company, Honda Motor Company, Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, PSA Peugeot Citroen, Renault-Nissan B.V., Suzuki Motor Corporation, Toyota Motor Corporation, and Volkswagen AG Group.



Seasonality.We generally record the sale of a vehicle (and recognize revenue) when it is produced and shipped or delivered to our customer (i.e., the dealership).  See the "Overview" section in Item 7 for additional discussion of revenue recognition practices.



We manage our vehicle production schedule based on a number of factors, including retail sales (i.e., units sold by our dealerships to their customers at retail) and dealer stock levels (i.e., the number of units held in inventory by our dealerships for sale to their customers).  In the past, we have experienced some seasonal fluctuation in the business, with production in many markets tending to be higher in the first half of the year to meet demand in the spring and summer (typically the strongest sales months of the year).  Third quarter production has tended to be the lowest.  As a result, operating results for the third quarter typically have been less favorable than other quarters.



Raw Materials.We purchase a wide variety of raw materials from numerous suppliers around the world for use in production of our vehicles.  These materials include ferrous metals (e.g., steel and iron castings), non-ferrous metals (e.g., aluminum), precious metals (e.g., palladium), energy (e.g., natural gas), and plastics/resins (e.g., polypropylene).  We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of raw materials necessary to meet our needs.  There always are risks and uncertainties with respect to the supply of raw materials, however, which could impact availability in sufficient quantities to meet our needs.  See the "Overview" section of Item 7 for a discussion of commodity and energy price trends, and "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" ("Item 7A") for a discussion of commodity price risks.



Backlog Orders.We generally produce and ship our products on average within approximately 20 days after an order is deemed to become firm.  Therefore, no significant amount of backlog orders accumulates during any period.



Intellectual Property.We own or hold licenses to use numerous patents, copyrights, and trademarks on a global basis.  Our policy is to protect our competitive position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and international patent applications to protect technology and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business.  We have generated a large number of patents, and expect this portfolio to continue to grow as we actively pursue additional technological innovation.  We currently have approximately 17,660 active patents and pending patent applications globally, with an average age for patents in our active patent portfolio of just under five and a half years.  In addition to this intellectual property, we also rely on our proprietary knowledge and ongoing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position.  Although we believe that these patents, patent applications, and know-how, in the aggregate, are important to the conduct of our business, and we obtain licenses to use certain intellectual property owned by others, none is individually considered material to our business.  We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of our Company and its products and services globally.  Certain of these marks are integral to the conduct of our business, a loss of any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.



Warranty Coverage and Additional Service Actions.We currently provide warranties on vehicles we sell.  Warranties are offered for specific periods of time and/or mileage, and vary depending upon the type of product, usage of the product and the geographic location of its sale.  In compliance with regulatory requirements, we also provide emissions-defects and emissions-performance warranty coverage.  Pursuant to these warranties, we will repair, replace, or adjust all parts on a vehicle that are defective in factory-supplied materials or workmanship during the specified warranty period.  In addition to the costs associated with the warranty coverage provided on our vehicles, we also incur costs as a result of additional service actions not covered by our warranties, including product recalls and customer satisfaction actions.



For additional information regarding warranty and related costs, see "Critical Accounting Estimates" in Item 7 and Note 30 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.

Industry Sales Volume



Industry sales volume is an internal estimate based on publicly-available data collected from various government, private, and public sources around the globe.  The following chart shows industry sales volume for the last five years for certain key markets in each region, and for the total we track within each of our Ford North America, Ford South America, Ford Europe, and Ford Asia Pacific Africa regions (in millions of units):

______________

(a)Throughout this Report, industry sales volume and wholesale unit volumes include sales of medium and heavy trucks.

(b)Ford South America industry sales volume and market share are based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations for the six markets we track in the region (i.e., Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela).

(c)Ford Europe industry sales volume and market share are based, in part, on estimated vehicle registrations for the 19 markets we track (i.e., Austria, Belgium, Britain, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland); sales of Ford-brand vehicles in Turkey and Russia by our unconsolidated affiliates Ford Otomotiv Sanayi Anonim Sirketi ("Ford Otosan") and Ford Sollers Netherlands B.V. ("FordSollers"), respectively, contribute to Ford Europe's wholesale unit volumes, but are not reflected in industry sales volume or market share for the region.

(d)ASEAN includes Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam.

(e)Ford Asia Pacific Africa industry sales volume and market share are based, in part, on estimated vehicle sales for the 12 markets we track (i.e., Australia, China, Japan, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Philippines, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam); market share data for 2008 to the present include local-brand vehicles produced by our Chinese joint venture Jiangling Motors Corporation, Ltd. ("JMC").

(a) Throughout this Report, wholesale unit volumes include all Ford-badged units (whether produced by Ford or by an unconsolidated affiliate), units manufactured by Ford that are sold to other manufacturers and units distributed for other manufacturers, and JMC-brand vehicles.  Revenue from certain vehicles in wholesale unit volumes (specifically, Ford-badged vehicles produced and distributed by our unconsolidated affiliates, and JMC-brand vehicles) are not included in our revenue.  Vehicles sold to daily rental car companies that are subject to a guaranteed repurchase option, as well as other sales of finished vehicles for which the recognition of revenue is deferred (e.g., consignments), are included in wholesale unit volumes.

(b)Throughout this Report, regional wholesale unit volumes include wholesales to various export markets.

______________

(a)  Throughout this Report, market share represents reported retail sales of our brands as a percent of total industry sales volume in the relevant market (as opposed to wholesale unit volumes reflecting sales directly by us to our customers, generally our dealers); market share data also exclude Volvo.



United States.The competitive environment in the United States continues to intensify as foreign manufacturers increase imports to the United States and production capacity in North America.  Overall, we see a long-term industry trend toward smaller and more fuel-efficient vehicles, and we believe the long-term trend of growth in the U.S. small car segment remains intact.  The small car segment has increased its share from 14% in 2004 to 20.6% in 2009 - one of the most significant segment shifts in the industry.  Although small cars dipped to 18.8% of industry in 2010, the segment grew again in 2011, increasing to 19.1% of total industry.  At the same time, our sales of small cars at Ford were up 25% in 2011, giving us 10% share of the small car segment and more than a full percentage point increase compared to 2010 - our best share in the U.S. small car segment since 2003.



Small car-based utilities were another of the fastest growing U.S. industry segments in 2011, increasing to 13.7% of industry compared with 8.2% in 2004.  Our Escape small utility was the best-selling utility in America last year, and 2011 was our best sales year for Escape since the vehicle was introduced in 2000.  The mid-size utility vehicle segment represents the largest segment within the utility category.  This segment continues to grow, albeit at a slower pace than the small utility segment.  In 2011, the mid-size utility segment represented 14.5% of total vehicles sales. This compares to 13% in 2004.  The majority of the segment is now represented by uni-body platforms, as opposed to body-on-frame platforms commonly in use 10 years ago.  Sales for our all-new uni-body Explorer were up 124% year-over-year for 2011.



Although the full-size pickup segment also has begun to grow in share of total industry again, we believe we will need to see a continued and sustainable recovery in the construction industry (including new housing starts) in order to see the full-size pickup segment increase significantly as a percentage of total industry sales.  With the full-size pickup segment at 10.7% of industry in 2009, 11.6% in 2010, and unchanged in 2011, we believe the segment is still in its initial phase of a cyclical recovery.  The peak year for full-size pickup trucks was 2004, with 14.7% of total industry.  Within the full-size pickup truck segment, our F-Series retains strong market leadership.



Our strong U.S. vehicle sales in 2011 reflect our balanced portfolio of fuel-efficient vehicles.  Our results marked the third consecutive year-over-year that our overall U.S. market share has increased, with the improvement driven in large measure by our new Fiesta small car and Escape and Explorer utilities.



The data above include both retail and fleet sales.  Fleet includes sales to commercial fleet customers, daily rental car companies, and governments; in general, fleet sales tend to be less profitable than retail sales.  In 2011, fleet sales were 32% of our total sales; the majority was with commercial and government customers, which are more profitable than daily rentals.  In 2011, our daily rental business was 12% of total sales, lower than the industry average of 13%.  As the leading manufacturer of commercial vehicles in the United States, commercial buyers are increasingly choosing Ford cars and crossovers because of our improved resale values, and continue to favor Ford trucks and vans.








ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



Canada.Industry sales volume in Canada grew 3% in 2011 compared with the prior year.  Within that total, truck sales increased by 1.6 percentage points to 56% of overall industry vehicle sales, while car sales decreased to 44% of industry sales volume.  Our sales growth in the market earned Ford Canada the sales leadership title for the second year in a row.  Strong sales in 2011 primarily reflected increased sales of cars, which gained 14% over the prior year, in addition to our already strong truck sales performance.  In 2011, Ford Canada earned segment leadership with Fusion, Mustang, Escape, Explorer, Ranger, F-150, and Super Duty.



Mexico.Industry sales volume in Mexico grew 10% during 2011.  Segmentation shifts in the industry away from trucks and utilities and toward cars contributed to our share decline.  Fleet sales also decreased in the last year as a result of government and commercial segment cutbacks.  Our plans for near-term market share growth include new model launches - including in the fastest-growing segment, small cars.



Ford South America



As indicated, we track industry sales and market share for six markets in South America - Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela.  Ford South America's wholesales are more inclusive, tracking Ford-brand vehicles in every market in the region.  Brazil and Argentina are our highest-volume South American markets.  In particular, Brazil's economy and demographics, with growing per capita income, low vehicle ownership rates, and a young population, have allowed its automotive market to more than double since 2002.  These favorable factors are expected to continue to contribute to growth in vehicle sales in Brazil.  The following tables show our wholesales and market share in the largest markets and in total:

Wholesales(in thousands)20112010200920082007Brazil346358336297258Argentina10585667777Ford South America506489443435438

The competition in Brazil is intensifying, as a number of automotive manufacturers are bringing online substantial capacity increases in the market.  The intensifying competitive environment is putting pressure on industry net pricing; our plans to leverage fully our One Ford plan, including the introduction of an all-new lineup of global products over the next two years, beginning in the second half of 2012, should benefit us in this market.



Ford Europe



The automotive industry in Europe is intensely competitive, and expected to intensify further as Japanese and Korean manufacturers increase production capacity in the region and manufacturers of premium brands (e.g., BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Audi) continue to broaden product offerings.



As indicated, we track industry and market share in Europe for the following 19 markets:  Austria, Belgium, Britain, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.  Ford Europe's wholesales are more inclusive, tracking Ford-brand vehicles in every market in the region, including those wholesales in Turkey and Russia from our unconsolidated affiliates, Ford Otosan and FordSollers.

ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



Within the 19 markets we track, Britain and Germany are our highest-volume markets.  Any change in the British or German market has a significant effect on the results of Ford Europe.  The following tables show our wholesales and market share for Britain and Germany (which are included within the 19 markets data above):

Britain.Industry sales volume in Britain began to decline in 2008 with the global financial crisis, and since 2003 has remained in the 2.2 million - 2.3 million unit range (compared with 2.8 million units in 2007).



Our market share remained steady in 2011 compared with the prior year, with Ford continuing as the market share leader in the Britain.  Unusually high market share in 2009 was driven by the launch of the popular Ford Ka and Ford Fiesta small cars, coincident with the implementation of a government vehicle scrappage program designed to stimulate vehicle sales.



Germany.With 3.5 million new vehicle registrations in 2011, Germany's industry sales volume grew by 9.6% compared with the prior year.  Germany was the only major market in Europe to experience an increase in industry sales volume in 2011, and remains the largest vehicle market in the European Union.  In 2011, both passenger car and commercial vehicle industry sales recovered along with the growing economy.



In 2011, Ford was the fastest growing manufacturer (with vehicle unit sales up 17.6% compared with the prior year), and increased market share by more than half of a percentage point primarily driven by the success of new Ford Focus, C-MAX, and S-MAX, as well as record sales of Ford Transit vehicles.



Turkey and Russia.Although not included in the results for the 19 European markets discussed above, Turkey and Russia also contribute to our Ford Europe segment results.  The following tables show our wholesales and market share for Turkey and Russia for the last five years:

Wholesales(in thousands)20112010200920082007Turkey1401307978100Russia1249374183180

Turkey.Industry growth slowed in 2008 as a result of the global financial crisis.  Beginning in 2009, industry vehicle sales accelerated due to government incentives put in place, with significant continuous increase in the last two years (from nearly 800,000 vehicle unit sales in 2010 to just over 900,000 vehicle unit sales in 2011).  As shown above, our 2011 wholesales surpassed pre-crisis levels, and our market share has increased in recent years.



Russia.Following a 50% contraction in 2009 as a result of the impact of the global financial crisis reaching Russia, industry sales volume has returned almost to pre-crisis levels, with industry sales volume of 2.7 million units in 2011.  Russia is the second-largest market for vehicle sales in Europe, and is expected to become the largest over the next several years.  Our sales grew by 30% in 2011, led by strong sales of the new Focus and Transit.  As previously reported, our Russian operations became part of the new FordSollers joint venture which began operations in October 2011.  We expect this joint venture to contribute to our ability to continue to grow profitably in this rapidly expanding market.








ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



Motor Vehicle Distribution in Europe.In 2009, the European Commission abolished the 2002 block exemption law that had been specific to vehicle distribution agreements, and adopted instead a new generic regulation applying to all manufacturer-distributor relationships.  The new law represents a marked improvement for manufacturers, and we have concluded new agreements with our dealers reflecting most of the improvements that will enter into effect on June 1, 2013.



Ford Asia Pacific Africa



Ford Asia Pacific Africa industry sales and market share data focus on our 12 major markets in the region; wholesales are more inclusive, tracking every market in the region.  Of the markets we track in this region, ASEAN, Australia, China, India, and South Africa are our principal markets.



Small cars account for 60% of Asia Pacific Africa industry sales volume, and are anticipated to continue to benefit from government policy.  We anticipate that the ongoing relaxation of import restrictions (including duty reductions) will continue to intensify competition in the region, particularly around small, ultra-affordable passenger cars.  The highly successful launches of our all-new Figo and Fiesta demonstrate our ability to successfully compete in key growth segments.  We anticipate further success with the introduction of the all-new EcoSport later in 2012.



The following tables show our wholesales and market share for key markets and in total for the last five years:

China and India are burgeoning markets that are expected to continue to experience rapid and substantial growth in the next ten years, driving new economic growth in the Asia Pacific Africa region.  Accordingly, we have increased and are planning to increase further our dealer networks and manufacturing capacity in the region.  We are building seven new plants - four in China, two in India, and one in Thailand - as part of our plan to have production capacity of 2.3 million vehicles in the region by mid-decade.  These new state-of-the-art highly-flexible manufacturing facilities will help us reach the goal of increasing worldwide sales to about 8 million vehicles per year by mid-decade.



In China, we also are significantly expanding our research and engineering center in Nanjing as part of our plan to accelerate our growth in China and in the Asia Pacific Region.

FINANCIAL SERVICES SECTOR



Ford Motor Credit Company LLC



Our wholly-owned subsidiary Ford Motor Credit Company LLC ("Ford Credit") offers a wide variety of automotive financing products to and through automotive dealers throughout the world.  The predominant share of Ford Credit’s business consists of financing our vehicles and supporting our dealers.  Ford Credit earns its revenue primarily from:



•Payments made under retail installment sale and lease contracts that it originates and purchases;

•Interest supplements and other support payments from us and our subsidiaries on special-rate financing programs; and

•Payments made under wholesale and other dealer loan financing programs.



As a result of these financing activities, Ford Credit has a large portfolio of finance receivables and leases which it classifies into two segments – "consumer" and "non-consumer."  Finance receivables and leases in the consumer segment relate to products offered to individuals and to businesses that finance the acquisition of vehicles from dealers for personal and commercial use.  The financing products include retail installment sale contracts for new and used vehicles, and leases for new vehicles to retail customers, government entities, daily rental car companies, and fleet customers.  Finance receivables in the non-consumer segment relate primarily to products offered to automotive dealers, including loans to finance the purchase of vehicle inventory (i.e., wholesale financing), for improvements to dealership facilities, for working capital, and for purchase of dealership real estate.  Ford Credit also purchases receivables generated by us and our subsidiaries, primarily in connection with the sale of parts and accessories.



Ford Credit does business in the United States and Canada through regional business centers.  Outside of the United States, FCE Bank plc ("FCE") is Ford Credit's largest operation; Europe is FCE's largest market.  Within Europe, FCE's largest and most profitable markets are Germany and the United Kingdom.  About 70% of FCE's finance and lease receivables are from FCE's customers and Ford dealers in Germany, the United Kingdom, and France; about 17% are from FCE's customers and Ford dealers in Italy and Spain; and about 2% are from FCE's customers and Ford dealers in Greece, Ireland, and Portugal.  FCE, through its Worldwide Trade Financing division, also provides financing to dealers in countries where typically we have no established local presence.



Ford Credit's share of retail financing for new Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold by dealers in the United States and new Ford vehicles sold by dealers in Europe, as well as its share of wholesale financing for new Ford and Lincoln vehicles acquired by dealers in the United States (excluding fleet) and new Ford vehicles acquired by dealers in Europe were:

See Item 7 and Notes 7, 8, and 9 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of Ford Credit's receivables, credit losses, allowance for credit losses, loss-to-receivables ratios, funding sources, and funding strategies. See Item 7A for a discussion of how Ford Credit manages its financial market risks.



We routinely sponsor special retail and lease incentives to dealers' customers who choose to finance or lease our vehicles from Ford Credit.  In order to compensate Ford Credit for the lower interest or lease rates offered to the retail customer, we pay the discounted value of the incentive directly to Ford Credit when it originates the retail finance or lease contract.  These programs increase Ford Credit's financing volume and share of financing sales of our vehicles.  See Note 2 of the Notes to the Financial Statements for information about our accounting for these programs.



In November 2008, we entered into an Amended and Restated Support Agreement with Ford Credit, pursuant to which, if its managed leverage for a calendar quarter were to be higher than 11.5 to 1 (as reported in its most recent periodic report), Ford Credit could require us to make or cause to be made a capital contribution to it in an amount sufficient to have caused such managed leverage to have been 11.5 to 1.  No capital contributions have been made pursuant to this agreement.  In addition, Ford Credit has an agreement to maintain FCE's net worth in excess of $500 million; no payments have been made pursuant to that agreement in 2001 - 2011.

GOVERNMENTAL STANDARDS



Many governmental standards and regulations relating to safety, fuel economy, emissions control, noise control, vehicle recycling, substances of concern, vehicle damage, and theft prevention are applicable to new motor vehicles, engines, and equipment manufactured for sale in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere.  In addition, manufacturing and other automotive assembly facilities in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are subject to stringent standards regulating air emissions, water discharges, and the handling and disposal of hazardous substances.  The most significant of the standards and regulations affecting us are discussed below:



Mobile Source Emissions Control



U.S. Requirements - Federal Emissions Standards.The federal Clean Air Act imposes stringent limits on the amount of regulated pollutants that lawfully may be emitted by new vehicles and engines produced for sale in the United States.  The current ("Tier 2") emissions regulations promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") set standards for cars and light trucks.  Tier 2 emissions standards also establish durability requirements for emissions components to 120,000 miles or 150,000 miles (depending on the specific standards to which the vehicle is certified).





U.S. Requirements - California and Other State Emissions Standards.



The Clean Air Act also permits other states that do not meet National Ambient Air Quality Standards to adopt California's motor vehicle emissions standards no later than two years before the affected model year.  In addition to California, fourteen states, primarily located in the Northeast and Northwest, have adopted the California standards for current and/or future model years (and eleven of these states also have adopted the ZEV requirements).  These states, together with California, account for more than 30% of our current U.S. light-duty vehicle sales volume.  It is possible that additional states may adopt the California standards in the future.  The adoption of California standards by other states presents challenges for manufacturers, including:  1) managing fleet average emissions standards and ZEV mandate requirements on a state-by-state basis, which presents difficulties from the standpoint of planning and distribution; 2) market acceptance of some vehicles required by the ZEV program varies from state to state, depending on weather and other factors; and 3) states adopting the California program have not adopted California's clean fuel regulations, which may impair the ability of vehicles in other states to meet California's in-use standards.








ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



CARB is in the process of revising its LEV and ZEV regulations.  In December 2011, CARB issued its proposed "LEV III" rules, setting standards for emissions of smog-forming pollutants (as well as greenhouse gases ("GHGs"), which are discussed in the "Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy" section below).  The proposed new standards would begin phasing in with the 2015 model year and extend through the 2025 model year.  The major elements of the LEV III program are new, more stringent tailpipe and evaporative emissions standards for light- and medium-duty vehicles; extended durability requirements; and changes to the certification test procedures, requiring manufacturers to certify vehicles on fuel containing 10% ethanol.  CARB also issued proposed new ZEV regulations covering model years 2015 - 2025.  The amendments for model years 2015 - 2017 represent relatively modest changes to existing requirements.  For model years 2018 - 2025, CARB is proposing to require substantial annual increases in the production and sale of battery-electric, fuel cell, and plug-in hybrid vehicles.  By the 2025 model year, approximately 15% of a manufacturer's total California sales volume will need to be made up of such vehicles.



Compliance with the revised LEV III and ZEV regulations likely will require costly actions that could have a substantial adverse effect on our sales volume and profits.  The LEV III proposal presents a significant engineering challenge for manufacturers, who will need to design new emissions after-treatment systems in order to comply.  The proposed ZEV rules pose an even greater obstacle, requiring intensive planning efforts and large capital investments in order to deliver the required number of advanced-technology vehicles.  We are concerned that the market and infrastructure in California may not support the large volumes of advanced-technology vehicles that manufacturers will be required to produce, particularly in the 2018 - 2025 model years.  We also are concerned about potential enforcement of the proposed ZEV mandate in other states that have adopted California's ZEV program, where the existence of a market for such vehicles is even less certain.  We are working with CARB directly and through the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers ("Alliance") in an effort to promote regulations that are reasonable and technologically feasible, and we have submitted comments on the proposed LEV III and ZEV rules.  The industry also is negotiating with states that have adopted California's ZEV rules in an effort to reach agreement on an alternative ZEV program for those states.



European Requirements.European Union ("EU") directives and related legislation limit the amount of regulated pollutants that may be emitted by new motor vehicles and engines sold in the EU.  Stringent new emissions standards ("Stage IV Standards") were applied to new passenger car certifications beginning in 2005, and to new registrations beginning in 2006.  The comparable light commercial truck Stage IV Standards went into effect for new certifications beginning in 2006, and for new registrations beginning in 2007.  This directive on emissions also introduced on-board diagnostic requirements, more stringent evaporative emissions requirements, and in-service compliance testing and recall provisions for emissions-related defects that occur in the first five years or 100,000 kilometers of vehicle life.  Failure of in-service compliance tests could lead to vehicle recalls with substantial costs for related inspections or repairs.



Stage V emissions requirements began for vehicle registrations starting in January 2011; Stage VI requirements will apply from September 2014.  Stage V particulate standards drove the deployment of particulate filters across diesels, and Stage VI further tightens the standard for oxides of nitrogen.  This will drive the need for additional diesel exhaust after-treatment which will add cost and potentially impact the diesel CO2advantage.  These technology requirements add cost and further erode the fuel economy cost/benefit advantage of diesel vehicles.



Vehicles equipped with SCR systems require a driver inducement and warning system for maintenance or repair.  The Stage V/VI emission legislation also mandated internet provision of all repair information (not just emissions-related), and provision of information to diagnostic tool manufacturers.



Other National Requirements.Many countries, in an effort to address air quality concerns, are adopting previous versions of European or United Nations Economic Commission for Europe ("UN-ECE") mobile source emissions regulations.  Some countries have adopted more advanced regulations based on the most recent version of European or U.S. regulations; for example, China plans to adopt the most recent European standards to be implemented starting from 2012 in large cities.  Korea and Taiwan have adopted very stringent U.S.-based standards for gasoline vehicles, and European-based standards for diesel vehicles.  Because fleet average requirements do not apply, some vehicle emissions control systems may have to be redesigned to meet the requirements in these markets.  Furthermore, not all of these countries have adopted appropriate fuel quality standards to accompany the stringent emissions standards adopted.  This could lead to compliance problems, particularly if on-board diagnostic or in-use surveillance requirements are implemented.  Japan has unique standards and test procedures, and implemented more stringent standards beginning in 2009.  This may require unique emissions control systems be designed for the Japanese market.  Canadian criteria emissions regulations are aligned with U.S. federal Tier 2 requirements.










ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



In South America, Brazil, Argentina and Chile are introducing more stringent emissions standards.  Brazil approved Euro V emissions and on-board diagnostic standards for heavy trucks starting in 2012; more stringent light vehicle limits come into effect in 2012.  Argentina has approved Euro V standards for 2012.  Chile approved a new decontamination plan for its metropolitan region with more stringent emission requirements based on U.S. or EU regulations.



Motor Vehicle Fuel Economy





U.S. Requirements - Light Duty Vehicles.  Federal law requires that light-duty vehicles meet minimum corporate average fuel economy ("CAFE") standards set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA").  A manufacturer is subject to potentially substantial civil penalties if it fails to meet the CAFE standard in any model year, after taking into account all available credits for the preceding three model years and expected credits for the five succeeding model years.  The law requires NHTSA to promulgate and enforce separate CAFE standards applicable to each manufacturer's fleet of domestic passenger cars, imported passenger cars, and light trucks, respectively.



California also has asserted the right to regulate motor vehicle GHG emissions, and a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision paved the way for EPA to regulate motor vehicle GHG emissions under the Clean Air Act.  The potential for three sets of overlapping and conflicting regulations led to the establishment of the federal "One National Program," pursuant to which EPA and NHTSA have promulgated regulations establishing a harmonized national program of CAFE and GHG regulations for light-duty vehicles for the 2012 - 2016 model years.  California has amended its regulations to provide that manufacturers who comply with "One National Program" regulations will be deemed to comply with the California GHG regulations.  The 2012 - 2016 federal GHG and fuel economy standards are very challenging.  They require new light-duty vehicles to ramp up to an industry average fuel economy of approximately 35.5 mpg by the 2016 model year, which amounts to the steepest rate of increase in fuel economy standards since the inception of the CAFE program.  CARB has adopted modifications to its GHG regulations consistent with these standards.



We believe that we will be able to comply with the harmonized federal CAFE/GHG standards for the 2012 - 2016 model years, as a result of aggressive actions to improve fuel economy that we built into our cycle plan, and through a variety of flexible compliance mechanisms.  In contrast, we had projected that we would be unable to comply with the state GHG standards that had been in place for the 2012 - 2016 period without undertaking costly product restrictions in some states.  Key differences that enable us to project compliance with the national program include:  1) One National Program standards, although very stringent, do not ramp up as steeply as the state standards they are replacing; and 2) One National Program allows us to determine compliance based on nationwide sales rather than state-by-state sales.  The ability to average across the nation eliminates state-to-state sales variability and is a critical element for us and for the automotive industry.  The 2012-2016 model year One National Program rules currently are being challenged in federal court by entities concerned about the ramifications of these rules on stationary source regulation.  The automotive industry has intervened in the litigation in support of maintaining the existing One National Program rules.



In November 2011, EPA and NHTSA jointly issued proposed rules to extend the One National Program framework through the 2025 model year.  The proposed rules would require manufacturers to achieve, across the industry, a light-duty fleet average fuel economy of approximately 45 miles per gallon ("mpg") by the 2021 model year, and approximately 54.5 mpg by the 2025 model year, assuming all of the CO2emissions reductions are achieved through the deployment of fuel economy technology.  This represents a reduction of roughly 5% per year in CO2emissions from passenger cars for the 2017 - 2025 model years.  For light trucks, the proposed standards represent a reduction in CO2emissions of about 3.5% per year for model years 2017 - 2021, and about 5% per year for model years 2022 - 2025.  Each manufacturer's








ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



specific task would depend on the mix of vehicles it sells.  The proposed rules include the opportunity for manufacturers to earn credits for technologies that achieve real-world CO2reductions, and fuel economy improvements that are not captured by EPA fuel economy test procedures.  Manufacturers also can earn credits for GHG reductions not specifically tied to fuel economy, such as improvements in air conditioning systems.  The proposal includes a mid-term evaluation process under which EPA and NHTSA will re-evaluate their standards for model year 2022 - 2025 by 2018 in order to ensure that those standards are feasible and optimal in light of intervening events.  Ford and the Alliance have filed extensive comments on the proposal.  EPA and NHTSA are expected to issue final rules in 2012, and shortly thereafter CARB is expected to modify its regulations to provide that compliance with the federal program satisfies compliance with California's requirements for the 2017 - 2025 model years.



While the proposed rules are challenging, we believe they are feasible in light of our product plans and projected market conditions.  It is important that the final rules retain the key elements of the proposal, such as the compliance flexibilities and the mid-term review evaluation process.  Provided the final rules are acceptable, we believe it is in our interest to continue with One National Program rather than re-engage in disputes with California (and other states that use the California standards) over the right to enforce state-specific GHG standards.



If the final rules promulgated by EPA and NHTSA deviate materially from the proposed rules, or if the agencies are forced to modify the rules as a result of litigation, it still is possible that the One National Program framework may not continue in the 2017 - 2025 model years.  Under this scenario, there likely would be a return to conflicting state and federal regimes for regulating fuel economy and GHG emissions beginning with the 2017 model year.  Compliance with both regimes would at best add enormous complexity to our planning processes, and at worst could be virtually impossible.  If either of these regulatory regimes impose and enforce extreme fuel economy or GHG standards, we likely would be forced to take various actions that could have substantial adverse effects on our sales volume and profits.  Such actions likely would include restricting offerings of selected engines and popular options; increasing market support programs for our most fuel-efficient cars and light trucks; and ultimately curtailing the production and sale of certain vehicles such as high-performance cars, utilities, and/or full-size light trucks, in order to maintain compliance.  These actions might need to occur on a state-by-state basis, in response to the rules adopted by California and other states, or at the national level if the federal standards are excessively stringent.



U.S. Requirements - Heavy-Duty Vehicles.In 2011, EPA and NHTSA promulgated final regulations imposing, for the first time, GHG and fuel economy standards on heavy-duty vehicles (generally, vehicles over 8,500 pounds gross vehicle weight rating).  In our case, the standards primarily affect our heavy-duty pickup trucks and vans, plus vocational vehicles such as shuttle buses and delivery trucks.  These standards will be challenging, but we believe we will be able to comply.  EPA and NHTSA are expected to issue a new round of standards for these vehicles covering the 2019 model year and beyond; as the standards increase in stringency, it may become more difficult to comply while continuing to offer a full lineup of heavy-duty trucks.  The 2014 - 2018 heavy-duty GHG rules are being challenged in federal court by entities other than truck and engine manufacturers.  Remand or rejection by the court could have a substantial adverse impact on our future production and sale of heavy-duty vehicles, depending on the court's specific order and agencies' response.



European Requirements.

In December 2008, the EU approved regulation of passenger car CO


emissions beginning in 2012 which limits the industry fleet average to a maximum of 130 g/km, using a sliding scale based on vehicle weight.  This regulation provides different targets for each manufacturer based on its respective average vehicle weight for its fleet of vehicles.  Limited credits are available for CO


off-cycle actions ("eco-innovations"), certain alternative fuels, and vehicles with CO


emissions below 50 g/km.  A penalty system will apply for manufacturers failing to meet targets, with fees ranging from €5 to €95 per vehicle per g/km shortfall in the years 2012 - 2018, and €95 per g/km shortfall beginning in 2019.  Manufacturers will be permitted to use a pooling agreement between wholly-owned brands to share the burden.  Further pooling agreements between different manufacturers also are possible, although it is not clear that these will be of much practical benefit under the regulations.  For 2020, an industry target of 95 g/km has been set.  This target will be further detailed in a review in 2013.  Other non-EU European countries are likely to follow with similar regulations.  For example, Switzerland is introducing similar rules, phasing-in beginning in July 2012 with the same targets, although the industry average emission target is significantly higher.  We face the risk of advance premium payment requirements based on past performance beginning in the second half of 2012.



In separate legislation, so-called "complementary measures" have been mandated (for example, tire-related and gearshift indicator requirements), and more mandates are expected.  These include requirements related to fuel economy indicators, and more-efficient low-CO2mobile air conditioning systems.  The EU Commission, Council and Parliament are close to formally approving a target for commercial light-duty vehicles to be at an industry average of 175 g/km (with phase-in from 2014 - 2017), and 147 g/km in 2020.  This regulation also would provide different targets for each manufacturer based on its respective average vehicle weight in its fleet of vehicles.  The final mass and CO2requirements for so-called "multi-stage vehicles" (e.g., our Transit chassis cabs) are fully allocated to the base manufacturer (e.g., Ford)








ITEM 1.  Business (continued)



so that the base manufacturer is fully responsible for the CO2performance of the final up-fitted vehicles.  The EU proposal also includes a penalty system, "super-credits" for vehicles below 50 g/km, and limited credits for CO2off-cycle actions ("eco-innovations"), pooling, etc., similar to the passenger car CO2regulation.



Some European countries have implemented or are considering other initiatives for reducing CO2vehicle emissions, including fiscal measures and CO2labeling.  For example, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, and the Netherlands, among others, have introduced taxation based on CO2emissions.  The EU CO2requirements are likely to trigger further measures.



Other National Requirements.The Canadian federal government has regulated vehicle GHG emissions under the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, beginning with the 2011 model year.  The standards track the new U.S. CAFE standards for the 2011 model year and U.S. EPA GHG regulations for the 2012 - 2016 model years.  The Canadian federal government now has published a notice of intent to maintain alignment with U.S. EPA vehicle GHG standards for the 2017 - 2025 model years.  In December 2009, Quebec also enacted province-specific regulations setting fleet average GHG standards for the 2010 - 2016 model years effective January 2010.  Now that the Canadian federal regulation is in place, the Quebec government has amended the Quebec regulation to recognize equivalency with the federal standards; reporting of Quebec fleet performance still is required.



Some Asian countries (such as China, Japan, India, South Korea, and Taiwan) also have adopted fuel efficiency or labeling targets.  For example, Japan has fuel efficiency targets for 2015 that are more stringent than the 2010 targets, with incentives for early adoption.  China implemented second-stage fuel economy targets from 2008, and is working on the third stage for 2012 phase-in.  All of these fuel efficiency targets will impact the cost of vehicle technology in the future.



In South America, Brazil introduced a voluntary vehicle energy-efficiency labeling program, indicating fuel consumption rates for light vehicles with spark ignition engine.  Chile also will adopt a fuel-consumption and emissions-labeling system.  In general, fuel efficiency targets may impact the cost of technology of our models in the future.



Motor Vehicle Safety



U.S. Requirements.The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the "Safety Act") regulates vehicles and vehicle equipment in two primary ways.  First, the Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable vehicle safety standards established by NHTSA.  Meeting or exceeding many safety standards is costly, in part because the standards tend to conflict with the need to reduce vehicle weight in order to meet emissions and fuel economy standards.  Second, the Safety Act requires that defects related to motor vehicle safety be remedied through safety recall campaigns.  A manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard.  Should we or NHTSA determine that either a safety defect or noncompliance exists with respect to any of our vehicles, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial.



Foreign Requirements.The EU and many countries around the world have established vehicle safety standards and regulations, and are likely to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in the future.  The European General Safety Regulation introduced UN-ECE regulations, which will be will be required for the European Type Approval process.  EU regulators also are focusing on active safety features such as lane departure warning systems, electronic stability control, and automatic brake assist.  These technologies have been implemented in Europe with final regulation and implementing measures having become available in late 2011.  Globally, governments generally have been adopting EU-based regulations with minor variations to address local concerns.  The difference between North American and EU-based regulations adds complexity and costs to the development of global platform vehicles; we continue to support efforts to harmonize regulations to reduce vehicle design complexity while providing a common level of safety performance.  New recall requirements in Asia Pacific Africa also may add substantial costs and complexity to our global recall practice.



Pollution Control Costs



During the period 2012 through 2016, we expect to spend about $160 million on our facilities in the Americas and Europe to comply with stationary source air and water pollution and hazardous waste control standards that are now in effect or are scheduled to come into effect during this period.  Of this total, we currently estimate we will spend between $30 million and $35 million in each of 2012 and 2013, respectively.  Specific environmental expenses are difficult to isolate because expenditures may be made for more than one purpose, making precise classification difficult.

EMPLOYMENT DATA



The approximate number of individuals employed by us and entities that we consolidated as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 was as follows (in thousands):

20112010AutomotiveFord North America7575Ford South America1615Ford Europe4749Ford Asia Pacific Africa1918Financial ServicesFord Credit77Total164164



While our overall employment remained steady, Ford Europe experienced reductions related largely to the transfer of Russian operations to our FordSollers unconsolidated joint venture, offset partially by increases in emerging markets to support increased production.



Substantially all of the hourly employees in our Automotive operations are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements.  In the United States, approximately 99% of these unionized hourly employees in our Automotive sector are represented by the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("UAW" or "United Auto Workers").  Approximately two percent of our U.S. salaried employees are represented by unions.  Most hourly employees and many non-management salaried employees of our subsidiaries outside of the United States also are represented by unions.



In 2011, we entered into a new four-year collective bargaining agreement with the UAW.  The agreement covers approximately 41,000 employees, and maintains our progress on improving competitiveness in the United States.  Excluding profit-sharing, compensation-related terms - including lump-sum payments (in lieu of general wage increases and cost of living increases) and continuation of an entry-level wage structure - are expected to increase U.S. hourly labor costs by less than 1% annually over the four-year contract period.  We also expect this increase will be more than offset by more flexible work rules that will allow us to increase manufacturing utilization and efficiency.



In 2011, we also negotiated new collective bargaining agreements with labor unions in Argentina, Brazil, France, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, and Thailand.



In 2012, we will negotiate a new agreement in Canada with the National Automobile, Aerospace, Transportation and General Workers Union of Canada ("CAW"), as well as labor unions in Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Britain, France, Germany, Mexico, Romania, Taiwan and Turkey.





ENGINEERING, RESEARCH, AND DEVELOPMENT



We engage in engineering, research, and development primarily to improve the performance (including fuel efficiency), safety, and customer satisfaction of our products, and to develop new products.  We maintain extensive engineering, research, and design centers for these purposes, including large centers in Dearborn, Michigan; Dunton, England; and Aachen and Merkenich, Germany.  Most of our engineering, research, and development relates to our Automotive sector.



Engineering, research, and development expenses for 2011, 2010, and 2009 were $5.3 billion, $5 billion, and $4.7 billion, respectively (2009 data adjusted to reflect the impact of the accounting standard on consolidation of variable interest entities ("VIEs")).
