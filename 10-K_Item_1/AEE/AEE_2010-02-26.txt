ITEM 1.BUSINESS.

GENERAL



Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA 2005
administered by FERC. Ameren was formed in 1997 by the merger of UE and CIPSCO. Ameren acquired CILCORP in 2003 and IP in 2004. Ameren’s primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries, including UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP.
Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate, as the case may be, rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and distribution businesses,
rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, and merchant generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the payment of other expenses by Ameren depend on distributions made to it
by its subsidiaries.As part of an internal reorganization, Resources Company transferred its 80% ownership interest in EEI to Genco,
through a capital contribution, on January 1, 2010.

The following table presents our total employees at December 31, 2009:Ameren(a)9,780UE4,425CIPS657Genco553CILCO1,183IP1,132(a)Total for Ameren includes Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries.As of January 1, 2010, the IBEW, the IUOE, the NCF&O and the Laborers and Gas Fitters labor unions collectively represented about 59% of Ameren’s total employees. They represented 64% of the employees
at UE, 83% at CIPS, 72% at Genco, 38% at CILCO, and 90% at IP. All collective bargaining agreements that expired in 2009 have been renegotiated and ratified. Most of the collective bargaining agreements have three- to five-year terms, and expire
between 2011 and 2013.









In 2009, Ameren initiated a voluntary separation program that provided eligible management employees the opportunity to voluntarily terminate their
employment and receive benefits consistent with Ameren’s standard management severance program. This program was offered to eligible management employees at Ameren’s subsidiaries, including UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP. Additionally,
Ameren initiated an involuntary separation program to reduce additional management positions under terms and benefits consistent with Ameren’s standard management severance program. In the third quarter of 2009, Genco announced operational
changes and staff reductions at three of its generating facilities. The affected three plants were the Meredosia, Grand Tower, and Hutsonville plants. In addition, Genco retired two of the four units at its Meredosia plant. The Grand Tower plant
will be operated seasonally from May through September; a very limited staff will maintain the plant during the other months. The number of positions eliminated as a result of these separation programs and operational changes was approximately 300.

For additional information about the development of our businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our operations and
financial position, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of
this report.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Ameren has three reportable segments: Missouri Regulated, Illinois Regulated, and Merchant Generation. CILCO has two reportable segments: Illinois Regulated and Merchant Generation. See Note 18 – Segment
Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on reporting segments.

RATES AND
REGULATION

Rates

The rates
that UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly
regulated. The utility rates charged to UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP customers are determined, in large part, by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the cost
of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, economic conditions, public policy, and social and political views, and are largely outside of our control. Decisions made by
these governmental entities regarding rates, as well as the regulatory lag involved in filing and getting new rates approved, could have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of Ameren, UE, CIPS, CILCO and
IP.

The ICC regulates rates and other matters for CIPS, CILCO and IP. The MoPSC regulates rates and other matters

for UE. The FERC regulates UE, CIPS, Genco, CILCO and IP as to their ability to charge market-based rates for the sale and transmission of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters
discussed below under General Regulatory Matters.

About 38% of Ameren’s electric and 14% of its gas operating revenues were subject
to regulation by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2009. About 39% of Ameren’s electric and 86% of its gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31, 2009. Wholesale revenues for UE,
Genco and AERG are subject to FERC regulation, but not subject to direct MoPSC or ICC regulation.

Missouri Regulated

Electric

About 83% of UE’s electric operating
revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2009. Effective March 1, 2009, as a result of a MoPSC electric rate order issued in January 2009, UE’s retail electric rates include a FAC for billing
adjustments for changes in prudently incurred fuel and purchased power costs.

FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and
conditions for electric transmission services. Each RTO separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by FERC. All members within that RTO are then subjected to those rates. As a member of MISO, UE’s transmission rate is
calculated in accordance with MISO’s rate formula. The transmission rate is updated in June of each year based on FERC filings. This rate is charged directly to wholesale customers. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers
because the MoPSC includes transmission-related costs in setting bundled retail rates in Missouri.

Natural Gas

All of UE’s natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2009.

If certain criteria are met, UE’s natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred
natural gas costs to be passed directly to the consumer. The ISRS also permits prudently incurred natural gas infrastructure replacement costs to be passed directly to the consumer.

As part of a 2007 stipulation and agreement approved by the MoPSC that authorized an increase in annual natural gas delivery revenues of $6 million
effective April 1, 2007, UE agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before March 15, 2010. This agreement did not prevent UE from filing to recover gas infrastructure replacement costs through an ISRS during this three-year
rate moratorium. Since April 1, 2007, the MoPSC has approved three separate requests from UE for an ISRS to recover annual revenues of $3 million, in the aggregate. These surcharges remain in place until new rates go into effect.









For additional information on Missouri rate matters, including UE’s pending electric rate case
and UE’s 2009 electric rate order, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Illinois Regulated

The following table presents the approximate percentage of electric and
natural gas operating revenues subject to regulation by the ICC for each of the Illinois Regulated companies for the year ended December 31, 2009:



ElectricNatural GasCIPS100%100%CILCO(a)41100IP100100



(a)AERG’s revenues are not subject to ICC regulation.

Under the Illinois Customer Choice Law, all electric customers in Illinois may choose their own electric energy provider. However, the Ameren Illinois Utilities are required to serve as the provider of last resort (POLR) for electric
customers within their territory who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier. The Ameren Illinois Utilities’ obligation to provide full requirements electric service, including power supply, as a POLR varies by customer size.
The Ameren Illinois Utilities are not required to offer fixed priced electric service to many of their largest customers with electric demands of 400 kilowatts or greater, as this group of customers has been declared competitive. The power
procurement costs incurred by the Ameren Illinois Utilities are passed directly to their customers through a cost recovery mechanism.

Environmental adjustment rate riders authorized by the ICC permit the recovery of prudently incurred MGP remediation and litigation costs from CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s Illinois electric and natural gas utility customers. In
addition, IP has a tariff rider to recover the costs of asbestos-related litigation claims, subject to the following terms: 90% of cash expenditures in excess of the amount included in base electric rates is recoverable by IP from a trust fund
established by IP. At December 31, 2009, the trust fund balance was $23 million, including accumulated interest. If cash expenditures are less than the amount in base rates, IP will contribute 90% of the difference to the fund. Once the trust
fund is depleted, 90% of allowed cash expenditures in excess of base rates will be recoverable through charges assessed to customers under the tariff rider.

In 2009, a new law became effective in Illinois that allows electric and natural gas utilities to recover through a rate adjustment the difference between their actual bad debt expense and the bad debt expense
included in their base rates. In February 2010, the ICC approved the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ electric and natural gas rate adjustment tariffs to recover bad debt expense not recovered in base rates.



If certain criteria are met, CIPS’, CILCO’s and IP’s natural gas rates may be adjusted
without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to the consumer.

FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services. Each RTO separately files regional transmission tariff rates for approval by FERC. All members within that RTO are then subjected to those
rates. As members of MISO, the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ transmission rate is calculated in accordance with MISO’s rate formula. The transmission rate is updated in June of each year based on FERC filings. This rate is charged directly to
wholesale customers and alternative retail electric suppliers. For retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier, the transmission rate is collected through a rider mechanism.

For additional information on Illinois rate matters, including the currently pending electric and natural gas rate cases, see Results of Operations and
Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and
Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Merchant Generation

Merchant Generation revenues are determined by market conditions and contractual arrangements. We expect the Merchant Generation fleet of assets to
have 6,370 megawatts of capacity available for the 2010 peak summer electrical demand. As discussed below, Genco, AERG and EEI sell all of their power and capacity to Marketing Company through power supply agreements. Marketing Company attempts to
optimize the value of those assets and mitigate risks through a variety of hedging techniques, including wholesale sales of capacity and energy, retail sales in the non-rate-regulated Illinois market, spot market sales primarily in MISO and PJM, and
financial transactions. Marketing Company enters into long-term and short-term contracts. Marketing Company’s counterparties include cooperatives, municipalities, commercial and industrial customers, power marketers, MISO, and investor-owned
utilities such as the Ameren Illinois Utilities. For additional information on Marketing Company’s hedging activities and Marketing Company’s sales to the Ameren Illinois Utilities, see Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 and Note 7 – Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 14 – Related Party Transactions under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

General Regulatory Matters

UE, CIPS, CILCO and
IP must receive FERC approval to issue short-term debt securities and to conduct certain acquisitions, mergers and consolidations involving electric utility holding companies having a value in excess of $10 million. In addition, these Ameren
utilities must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory









agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities (with maturities of more than 12 months) and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities. Genco, AERG and EEI are
subject to FERC’s jurisdiction when they issue any securities.

Under PUHCA 2005, FERC and any state public utility regulatory
agencies may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are determined to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries with respect to jurisdictional rates. PUHCA 2005 also permits Ameren, the ICC, or
the MoPSC to request that FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren companies.

Operation of UE’s Callaway
nuclear plant is subject to regulation by the NRC. Its facility operating license expires on June 11, 2024. UE intends to submit a license extension application with the NRC to extend the plant’s operating license to 2044. UE’s Osage
hydroelectric plant and UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric plant, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other things, the general operation and maintenance of the projects.
The license for UE’s Osage hydroelectric plant expires on March 30, 2047, and the license for UE’s Taum Sauk plant expires on June 30, 2010. In June 2008, UE filed an application with FERC to relicense its Taum Sauk plant for
another 40 years. Approval and relicensure are expected in 2012. Operations are permitted to continue under the current license while the application for relicensing is pending. The Taum Sauk plant is currently out of service. It is being rebuilt
due to a major breach of the upper reservoir in December 2005. UE expects the Taum Sauk plant to become operational in the second quarter of 2010. UE’s Keokuk plant and its dam, in the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk,
Iowa, are operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

For additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2
– Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report, which include a discussion about the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at UE’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage
hydroelectric plant.

Environmental Matters

Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental statutes or regulations relating to the safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment. These environmental statutes
and regulations include requirements for identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, reporting, and emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials, safety and health
standards, and environmental protection requirements, including standards and limitations relating to the discharge of air and water pollutants and the management of waste and byproduct materials. Failure to comply with those statutes or regulations
could have material adverse effects on us. We could be subject to criminal or civil penalties by regulatory

agencies. We could be ordered to make payment to private parties by the courts. Except as indicated in this report, we believe that we are in material compliance with existing statutes and
regulations.

For additional discussion of environmental matters, including NOx, SO2, and mercury emission reduction requirements, global climate change, remediation efforts and UE’s receipt in January 2010 of a
Notice of Violation from the EPA alleging violations of the Clean Air Act’s NSR and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) provisions, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 
8, of this report.

SUPPLY FOR ELECTRIC POWER

Ameren owns an integrated transmission system that comprises the transmission assets of UE, CIPS, CILCO, IP and AITC. Ameren also operates two
balancing authority areas, AMMO (which includes UE) and AMIL (which includes CIPS, CILCO, IP, AITC, Genco and AERG). During 2009, the peak demand in AMMO was 8,081 MW and in AMIL was 8,607 MW. The Ameren transmission system directly connects with 15
other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy.

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are transmission-owning members of MISO.
Transmission service on the UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP transmission systems is provided pursuant to the terms of the MISO OATT on file with FERC. EEI operates its own balancing authority area and its own transmission facilities in southern Illinois. The
EEI transmission system is directly connected to MISO and TVA. EEI’s generating units are dispatched separately from those of UE, Genco and AERG.

The Ameren Companies and EEI are members of SERC. SERC is responsible for the bulk electric power supply system in much of the southeastern United States, including all or portions of Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas,
Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Virginia, Florida, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Texas.

See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.

Missouri Regulated

UE’s electric supply is obtained primarily from its own generation. Factors that could cause UE to purchase power include,
among other things, absence of sufficient owned generation, plant outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy requirements, the failure of suppliers to meet their power supply obligations, extreme weather conditions, and the availability of power
at a cost lower than the cost of generating it.

UE continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new baseload and peaking electric
generation capacity. UE’s























integrated resource plan filed with the MoPSC in February 2008 included the expectation that new baseload generation capacity would be required in the 2018 to 2020 time frame. Due to the
significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, UE is actively studying future plant alternatives, including energy efficiency programs that could help defer new plant construction. UE’s 2008 integrated
resource plan included proposals to pursue energy efficiency programs, expand the role of renewable energy sources in UE’s overall generation mix, increase operational efficiency at existing power plants, and possibly retire some generating
units that are older and less efficient. UE will file a new integrated resource plan with the MoPSC in 2011.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7 and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of
this report.

Illinois Regulated

As of January 1, 2007, CIPS, CILCO and IP were required to obtain from market sources all electric supply requirements for customers, except those declared competitive, who did not purchase electric supply from third-party suppliers.
The power procurement costs incurred by CIPS, CILCO and IP are passed directly to their customers through a cost recovery mechanism.

In September 2006, a reverse power procurement auction was held, as a result of which CIPS, CILCO and IP entered into power supply contracts with the winning bidders, including Marketing Company. Under these contracts, the electric
suppliers are responsible for providing to CIPS, CILCO and IP energy, capacity, certain transmission, volumetric risk management, and other services necessary for the Ameren Illinois Utilities to serve the electric load needs of fixed-price
residential and small commercial customers (with less than one MW of demand) at an all-inclusive fixed price. These contracts commenced on January 1, 2007, with one-third of the supply contracts expiring in May 2008, 2009 and 2010.

As part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, the reverse power procurement auction process was discontinued and a new competitive
power procurement process led by the IPA beginning in 2009 was established. In January 2009, the ICC approved the electric power procurement plan filed by the IPA for both the Ameren Illinois Utilities and Commonwealth Edison Company. The plan
outlined the wholesale products that the IPA procured on behalf of the Ameren Illinois Utilities for the period June 1, 2009, through May 31, 2014. The IPA procured capacity, energy swaps, and renewable energy credits through an RFP
process on behalf of the Ameren

Illinois Utilities in the second quarter of 2009. In August 2009, the IPA submitted its plan to the ICC for procurement of electric power for the Ameren Illinois Utilities and Commonwealth Edison
Company for the period June 1, 2010, through May 31, 2015. The plan was modified and approved by the ICC in December 2009. The IPA will procure energy swaps, capacity and renewable energy credits, and long-term renewable supply.

A portion of the electric power supply required for the Ameren Illinois Utilities to satisfy their distribution customers’
requirements is purchased from Marketing Company on behalf of Genco, AERG and EEI. Also as part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, the Ameren Illinois Utilities entered into financial contracts with Marketing Company (for the
benefit of Genco and AERG) to lock in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of their round-the-clock power requirements during the period June 1, 2008, through December 31, 2012, at relevant market prices at that time. These
financial contracts do not include capacity, are not load-following products, and do not involve the physical delivery of energy.

See
Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 14 – Related Party Transactions and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on power procurement in Illinois.

Merchant Generation

Genco and AERG have
entered into power supply agreements with Marketing Company whereby Genco and AERG sell and Marketing Company purchases all the capacity available from Genco’s and AERG’s generation fleets and the associated energy. These power supply
agreements continue through December 31, 2022, and from year to year thereafter unless either party elects to terminate the agreement by providing the other party with no less than six months advance written notice. EEI and Marketing Company
have entered into a power supply agreement for EEI to sell all of its capacity and energy to Marketing Company. This agreement expires on December 31, 2015. All of Genco’s, AERG’s and EEI’s generating facilities compete for the
sale of energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through Marketing Company. See Note 14 – Related Party Transactions under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.

Factors that could cause Marketing Company to purchase power for the Merchant Generation business segment include, among other things, absence of
sufficient owned generation, plant outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy requirements, the failure of suppliers to meet their power supply obligations, extreme weather conditions, and the availability of power at a cost lower than the cost of
generating it.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

(c)The fuel cost for natural gas represents the cost of natural gas and firm and variable costs for transportation, storage, balancing, and fuel losses for delivery to the plant. In
addition, the fixed costs for firm transportation and firm storage capacity are included in the calculation of fuel cost for the generating facilities.

(d)Represents all costs for fuels used in our electric generating facilities, to the extent applicable, including coal, nuclear, natural gas, oil, propane, tire chips, paint
products, and handling. Oil, paint, propane, and tire chips are not individually listed in this table because their use is minimal.



CoalUE, Genco, AERG and EEI have agreements in place to purchase a portion of their coal needs and to transport it to electric generating facilities through 2019. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI expect to enter into additional contracts to purchase
coal from time to time. Coal supply agreements typically have an initial term of five years, with about 20% of the contracts expiring annually. Ameren burned 37.6 million tons (UE – 21.3 million, Genco – 7.9 million, AERG – 4.0
million, EEI – 4.4 million) of coal in 2009. See Part II, Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about coal supply contracts.About 96% of Ameren’s coal (UE – 96%, Genco – 99%, AERG – 89%, EEI – 100%) is purchased from the Powder River Basin in
Wyoming. The remaining coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin. UE, Genco, AERG and EEI have a policy to maintain coal inventory consistent with their projected usage. Inventory may be adjusted because of uncertainties of supply due to
potential

work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. In the past, deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail
maintenance, weather, and derailments. As of December 31, 2009, coal inventories for UE, Genco, AERG and EEI were at targeted levels. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause UE, Genco, AERG and EEI to pursue a strategy that could include
reducing sales of power during low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources.NuclearDeveloping nuclear fuel generally involves the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium
concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, the enrichment of that gas, and the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into usable fuel assemblies. UE has entered into uranium, uranium conversion,
enrichment, and fabrication contracts to procure the fuel supply for its Callaway nuclear plant.









Fuel assemblies for the 2010 spring refueling at UE’s Callaway nuclear plant have been manufactured and delivered to the plant. UE also has
agreements or inventories to price-hedge approximately 89% of Callaway’s 2011 and 79% of Callaway’s 2013 refueling requirements. UE has uranium (concentrate and hexafluoride) inventories and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its
uranium and conversion requirements at least through 2014. UE has enriched uranium inventories and enrichment supply contracts sufficient to satisfy enrichment requirements through 2012. Fuel fabrication services are under contract through
2010. UE expects to enter into additional contracts to purchase nuclear fuel. As a member of Fuelco, UE can join with other member companies to increase its purchasing power and opportunities for volume discounts. The Callaway nuclear plant
normally requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling was completed in November 2008. The nuclear fuel markets are competitive, and prices can be volatile; however, we do not anticipate any significant problems in meeting our future
supply requirements.

Natural Gas Supply

To maintain gas deliveries to gas-fired generating units throughout the year, especially during the summer peak demand, Ameren’s portfolio of natural gas supply resources includes firm transportation capacity and firm no-notice storage
capacity leased from interstate pipelines. UE, Genco and EEI primarily use the interstate pipeline systems of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, and Mississippi River Transmission
Corporation to transport natural gas to generating units. In addition to physical transactions, Ameren uses financial instruments, including some in the NYMEX futures market and some in the OTC financial markets, to hedge the price paid for natural
gas.

UE, Genco and EEI’s natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to
their generating units. UE, Genco and EEI do this in two ways. They optimize transportation and storage options and minimize cost and price risk through various supply and price-hedging agreements that allow them to maintain access to multiple gas
pools, supply basins, and storage. As of December 31, 2009, UE had price-hedged about 89% and Genco had price-hedged 100% of their expected natural gas supply requirements for generation in 2010. As of December 31, 2009, EEI did not have
any of its required gas supply for generation hedged for price risk.

Renewable Energy

Illinois and Missouri have enacted laws requiring electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. Illinois requires
renewable energy resources to equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers as of June 1, 2008, increasing to 10% by June 1, 2015, and to 25% by June 1, 2025. The
Ameren Illinois Utilities have procured renewable energy credits under the ICC-approved RFP to meet this requirement through May 2010. See Note 2 – Rate

and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, for additional information about the Illinois power procurement process. In Missouri, utilities will be required to purchase or generate
electricity from renewable energy sources equaling at least 2% of native load sales by 2011, with that percentage increasing in subsequent years to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a 1% limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each renewable
energy portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. UE expects to satisfy the 2011 requirement with existing renewable generation in its current fleet along with a 15-year, 102-MW power purchase agreement with a wind farm operator in
Iowa that began generation in 2009 and the 15-MW landfill gas project discussed below.

In September 2009, UE announced an agreement with
a landfill owner to install CTs at a landfill site in St. Louis County, Missouri, which would generate approximately 15-MW of electricity by burning methane gas collected from the landfill. Construction of the CTs is expected to begin in 2010, and
the CTs are expected to begin generating power in 2011. UE signed a 20-year supply agreement with the landfill owner to purchase methane gas.

Energy
Efficiency

Ameren’s regulated utilities have implemented energy efficiency programs to educate and help their customers become
more efficient users of energy. A new law in Missouri allows electric utilities to recover costs related to MoPSC-approved energy efficiency programs. The new law could, among other things, allow UE to earn a return on its energy efficiency programs
equivalent to the return UE could earn with supply-side capital investments, such as new power plants. UE introduced multiple energy efficiency programs in 2009. The goal of these recently announced and future UE energy efficiency programs is
to reduce usage by 540-MW by 2025. UE has set up a website at www.uefficiency.com in order to provide more information to its customers regarding energy efficiency.

The Ameren Illinois Utilities are participating in the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation, a program that supports energy efficiency, promotes renewable energy, and provides educational opportunities. In
June 2008, the ICC issued an order approving the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ electric energy efficiency plan as well as a cost recovery mechanism by which the program costs will be recovered from electric customers. In October 2008, the ICC
issued an order approving the Ameren Illinois Utilities’ natural gas energy efficiency plan as well as a cost recovery mechanism by which the program costs will be recovered from natural gas customers. The Ameren Illinois Utilities have set up
a website at www.actonenergy.com in order to provide more information to their customers regarding energy efficiency.

NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTION

UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP are responsible for the purchase and
delivery of natural gas to their gas utility customers. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP develop and manage a portfolio of gas supply resources. These include firm gas supply under term









agreements with producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain gas
deliveries to customers throughout the year and especially during peak demand. UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP primarily use the Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, the Trunkline Gas Company, the Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, the Mississippi
River Transmission Corporation, and the Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to physical transactions, financial instruments, including those entered into in the
NYMEX futures market and in the OTC financial markets, are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas. See Part II, Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about
natural gas supply contracts. Prudently incurred natural gas purchase costs are passed on to customers of UE, CIPS, CILCO and IP in Illinois and Missouri under PGA clauses, subject to prudency review by the ICC and the MoPSC.

INDUSTRY ISSUES

We are facing issues common to the electric and natural gas utility industry and the merchant electric generation industry. These issues include:



Ÿpolitical and regulatory resistance to higher rates, especially in a recessionary economic environment;

Ÿthe potential for changes in laws, regulation, and policies at the state and federal level, including those resulting from election cycles;

Ÿaccess to, and uncertainty in, the capital and credit markets;

Ÿthe potential for more intense competition in generation, supply and distribution, including new technologies;

Ÿpressure on customer growth and usage in light of current economic conditions;

Ÿthe potential for reregulation in some states, including Illinois, which could cause electric distribution companies to build or acquire generation facilities
and to purchase less power from electric generating companies such as Genco, AERG and EEI;

Ÿchanges in the structure of the industry as a result of changes in federal and state laws, including the formation of merchant generating and independent
transmission entities and RTOs;

Ÿincreases or decreases in power prices due to the balance of supply and demand;

Ÿthe availability of fuel and increases or decreases in fuel prices;

Ÿthe availability of qualified labor and material, and rising costs;

Ÿregulatory lag;

Ÿnegative free cash flows due to rising investments and the regulatory framework;

Ÿcontinually developing and complex environmental laws, regulations and issues, including air-quality standards, mercury regulations, and increasingly likely
greenhouse gas limitations and ash management requirements;

Ÿpublic concern about the siting of new facilities;

Ÿaging infrastructure and the need to construct new power generation, transmission and distribution facilities;

Ÿproposals for programs to encourage or mandate energy efficiency and renewable sources of power;

Ÿpublic concerns about nuclear plant operation and decommissioning and the disposal of nuclear waste; and

Ÿconsolidation of electric and natural gas companies.

We are monitoring these issues. Except as otherwise noted in this report, we are unable to predict what impact, if any, these issues will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. For
additional information, see Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, and Outlook and Regulatory Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 2 – Rate
and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.
