ITEM 1.BUSINESS.

GENERAL



Ameren, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, is a public utility holding company under PUHCA 2005
administered by FERC. Ameren was formed in 1997 by the merger of Ameren Missouri and CIPSCO Inc. Ameren acquired CILCORP in 2003 and IP in 2004. Ameren’s primary assets are the common stock of its subsidiaries, including Ameren Missouri, Ameren
Illinois and AER. Ameren’s subsidiaries are separate, independent legal entities with separate businesses, assets, and liabilities. These subsidiaries operate, as the case may be, rate-regulated electric generation, transmission, and
distribution businesses, rate-regulated natural gas transmission and distribution businesses, and merchant generation businesses in Missouri and Illinois. Dividends on Ameren’s common stock and the payment of other expenses by Ameren depend on
distributions made to it by its subsidiaries. Below is a summary description of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and AER. A more detailed description can be found in Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part II,
Item 8, of this report.ŸAmeren Missouri operates a rate-regulated electric generation, transmission and distribution business, and a rate-regulated natural gas transmission and
distribution business in Missouri.ŸAmeren Illinois operates a rate-regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution business in Illinois.

ŸAER consists of non-rate-regulated operations, including Genco, AERG, Marketing Company and Medina Valley (through February 2012). Genco operates a merchant
electric generation business in Illinois and holds an 80% ownership interest in EEI.The following table presents
our total employees at December 31, 2011:Ameren(a)9,323Ameren Missouri4,333Ameren Illinois2,793Genco618(a)Total for Ameren includes Ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries.As of January 1, 2012, the IBEW, the IUOE, the LIUNA, and the UA labor unions collectively represented about 58% of Ameren’s total employees. They represented 63% of the employees at Ameren Missouri, 65%
at Ameren Illinois, and 67% at Genco. The collective bargaining agreements have three- to five-year terms, and expire between 2012 and 2016. Several collective bargaining agreements between Ameren subsidiaries and the IBEW, covering approximately
3,500 employees, expire during 2012. Additionally, employees providing security at the Callaway energy center elected to organize under the UGSOA in August 2011.









Negotiations for a collective bargaining agreement with these employees began in December 2011 and are ongoing.

For additional information about the development of our businesses, our business operations, and factors affecting our operations and financial position, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial

Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, of this report and Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies under Part
II, Item 8, of this report.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Ameren has three reportable segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and Merchant Generation. See Note 18 – Segment Information under Part
II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on reporting segments.

RATES AND REGULATION

Rates

The rates that Ameren Missouri and
Ameren Illinois are allowed to charge for their utility services significantly influence the results of operations, financial position, and liquidity of these companies and Ameren. The electric and natural gas utility industry is highly regulated.
The utility rates charged to Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois customers are determined, in large part, by governmental entities, including the MoPSC, the ICC, and FERC. Decisions by these entities are influenced by many factors, including the
cost of providing service, the prudency of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory staff knowledge and experience, economic conditions, public policy, and social and political views. Decisions made by these governmental entities regarding
rates are largely outside of Ameren Missouri’s and Ameren Illinois’ control. These decisions, as well as the regulatory lag involved in filing and getting new rates approved, could have a material impact on the results of operations,
financial position, and liquidity of Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois. Rate orders are also subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are ultimately allowed to charge for
their services. Beginning in 2012, the effect of regulatory lag on Ameren Illinois’ electric distribution business is expected to be mitigated through the use of the formula ratemaking regulatory framework established under the IEIMA.

The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren
Missouri. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, Genco and ATXI as to their ability to charge market-based rates for the sale and transmission of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General
Regulatory Matters.

About 49% of Ameren’s electric and 16% of its natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by
the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2011. About 30% of Ameren’s electric and 84% of its natural gas operating

revenues were subject to regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31, 2011. Wholesale revenues for Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, Genco and AERG are subject to FERC regulation,
but not subject to direct MoPSC or ICC regulation.

Ameren Missouri

Electric

About 99% of Ameren Missouri’s electric operating revenues were subject to regulation
by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2011 with the remainder subject to FERC regulation.

In July 2011, the MoPSC issued an
order approving an increase for Ameren Missouri in annual revenues for electric service of $173 million, including $52 million related to an increase in normalized net fuel costs above the net fuel costs included in base rates previously authorized
by the MoPSC in its May 2010 electric rate order. The revenue increase was based on a 10.2% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 52.2% common equity, and a rate base of $6.6 billion. The rate changes became effective on July 31,
2011. The MoPSC order approved the continued use of Ameren Missouri’s vegetation management and infrastructure cost tracker, pension and postretirement benefit cost tracker, and FAC at the current 95% sharing level. The MoPSC order shortened
the FAC recovery and refund period from 12 months to eight months. Additionally, the MoPSC order provided for a tracking mechanism for uncertain income tax positions.

In February 2012, Ameren Missouri filed a request with the MoPSC to increase its annual revenues for electric service by $376 million. Included in this requested increase was a $103 million increase in normalized
net fuel costs above the net fuel costs included in base rates previously authorized by the MoPSC in its July 2011 electric rate order. Absent initiation of this general rate proceeding, 95% of this amount would have been reflected in rate
adjustments implemented under Ameren Missouri’s FAC. The request also included recovery of the costs associated with energy efficiency programs under the MEEIA, including energy efficiency investments, a storm cost tracking mechanism,
plant-in-service accounting treatment, and recovery of other costs incurred to provide systemwide reliability improvements for customers, among other items. The electric rate increase request was based on a 10.75% return on equity, a capital
structure composed of 52% common equity, an aggregate electric rate base of $6.8 billion, and a test year ended September 30, 2011, with certain pro forma adjustments expected through the anticipated true-up date of July 31, 2012. A
decision by the MoPSC in this proceeding is expected in December 2012.

FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions
for electric transmission services. Each RTO separately files a regional transmission tariff for approval by FERC. All transmission service within that RTO is then









subjected to that tariff. As a member of MISO, Ameren Missouri’s transmission rate is calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. The transmission rate is updated in

June of each year; it is based on Ameren Missouri’s filings with FERC. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers, because in Missouri the
MoPSC includes transmission-related costs in setting bundled retail rates.

Natural Gas

All of Ameren Missouri’s natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2011. In
January 2011, the MoPSC approved a stipulation and agreement that allowed Ameren Missouri to increase annual natural gas revenues by $9 million. The new rates became effective on February 20, 2011. As part of the stipulation and agreement,
Ameren Missouri agreed not to file a separate natural gas rate increase request before December 31, 2012; however, Ameren Missouri can file a combined natural gas and electric rate case before that date. Further, this agreement does not prevent
Ameren Missouri from filing to recover infrastructure replacement costs through an ISRS during this moratorium. The return on equity to be used by Ameren Missouri for purposes of the ISRS tariff filing is 10%.

If certain criteria are met, Ameren Missouri’s natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit
prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to the consumer. The ISRS also permits prudently incurred natural gas infrastructure replacement costs to be passed directly to the consumer.

For additional information on Missouri rate matters, including Ameren Missouri’s pending electric rate case, and Ameren Missouri’s 2009,
2010 and 2011 electric rate orders and related court appeals and regulatory proceedings, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7,
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Ameren Illinois

Electric

About 99% of Ameren Illinois’ electric operating revenues were subject to regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31, 2011 with
the remainder subject to FERC regulation.

Under the Illinois Customer Choice Law, all electric customers in Illinois may choose their
own electric energy provider. However, Ameren Illinois is required to serve as the provider of last resort (POLR) for electric customers within its territory who have not chosen an alternative retail

electric supplier. Ameren Illinois’ obligation to provide POLR electric service varies by customer size. Ameren Illinois is not required to offer fixed-priced electric service to customers
with electric demands of 400 kilowatts or greater, as the market for service to this group of customers has been declared competitive. Power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its customers through a
cost recovery mechanism.

In October 2011, the IEIMA was enacted into law and became effective immediately. Certain amendments to the
IEIMA became effective on December 30, 2011. On January 3, 2012, Ameren Illinois elected to participate in the performance-based formula ratemaking process established pursuant to the IEIMA by filing initial performance-based formula rates
with the ICC. The initial filing, based on 2010 recoverable costs and expected net plant additions for 2011 and 2012, will result in new electric delivery service rates in October 2012. Pending ICC approval, the initial filing will result in a
decrease in Ameren Illinois revenues for electric delivery service of $19 million, on an annualized basis. Ameren Illinois anticipates making an update filing by May 1, 2012, based on 2011 costs and expected net plant additions for 2012, that
would result in new electric delivery service rates on January 1, 2013.

By choosing to opt-in, Ameren Illinois will participate
in a performance-based formula process for determining rates that will provide for the recovery of actual costs of electric delivery service that are prudently incurred, reflect the utility’s actual regulated capital structure and include a
formula for calculating the return on equity component of the cost of capital. The equity component of the formula rate will be equal to the average for the applicable calendar year of the monthly average yields of 30-year United States treasury
bonds plus 590 basis points for 2012 and 580 basis points thereafter. Ameren Illinois’ actual return on equity relating to electric delivery service will be subject to a collar adjustment on earnings in excess of 50 basis points above or below
its allowed return. Beginning in 2012, the law provides for an annual reconciliation of revenues to costs prudently and reasonably incurred. This annual revenue reconciliation along with the collar adjustment, if necessary, will be collected from or
refunded to customers in a subsequent year.

Ameren Illinois will also be subject to five performance standards under the IEIMA whereby
the failure to achieve the standards will result in a reduction in its allowed return on equity calculated under the formula. The performance standards include improvements in service reliability to reduce both the frequency and duration of outages,
improvements in customer satisfaction scores, reduction in the number of estimated bills, and a reduction in uncollectible accounts expense. The IEIMA provides for return on equity penalties totaling up to 30 basis points in 2013 through 2015, 34
basis points in 2016 through 2018 and 38 basis points in 2019 through 2022 if the performance standards are not met. The formula ratemaking process is effective until the end of 2017, but could be extended by the Illinois General Assembly









for an additional five years. The formula ratemaking process

would also terminate if the average
residential rate increases by more than 2.5% annually from June 2011 through May 2014.

Between 2012 and 2021, Ameren Illinois will be
required to invest $625 million in capital expenditures

incremental to Ameren Illinois’ average electric delivery capital expenditures for calendar
years 2008 through 2010 to modernize its distribution system. Such investments are

expected to encourage economic development and create an estimated
450 additional jobs within Illinois. Ameren Illinois is subject to monetary penalties if 450 additional jobs are not created during the peak program year. Also, Ameren Illinois will be required to contribute $1 million annually for certain
nonrecoverable customer assistance programs, up to a total of $10 million through 2021, for as long as Ameren Illinois participates in the formula ratemaking process. Ameren Illinois will also be required to make a one-time $7.5 million
nonrecoverable donation to the Illinois Science and Energy Innovation Trust in 2012, as well as an approximate $1 million annual donation to the same trust for as long as it participates in the formula ratemaking process.

Ameren Illinois has a tariff rider to recover the costs of asbestos-related litigation claims, subject to the following terms: 90% of cash
expenditures in excess of the amount included in base electric rates are to be recovered from a trust fund that was established when Ameren acquired IP. At December 31, 2011, the trust fund balance was $23 million, including accumulated
interest. If cash expenditures are less than the amount in base rates, Ameren Illinois will contribute 90% of the difference to the fund. Once the trust fund is depleted, 90% of allowed cash expenditures in excess of base rates will be recovered
through charges assessed to customers under the tariff rider. Following the Ameren Illinois Merger, this rider is applicable only for claims that occurred within IP’s historical service territory. Similarly, the rider will permit recovery only
from customers within IP’s historical service territory.

As a member of MISO, Ameren Illinois’ transmission rate is
calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. The transmission rate is updated in June of each year based on Ameren Illinois’ filings with FERC. This rate is charged directly to wholesale customers and alternative retail electric suppliers.
Retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier pay the transmission rate through a rider mechanism.

Natural Gas

All of Ameren Illinois’ natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31,
2011.

In January 2012, the ICC issued a rate order that approved an increase in Ameren Illinois’ annual revenues for natural gas
delivery service of $32 million. The revenue increase was based on a 9.06% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 53.3% common equity, and a rate

base of approximately $1 billion. The rate order was based on a 2012 future test year. The rate changes became effective on January 20, 2012. In February 2012, the ICC denied rehearing
requests by Ameren Illinois and an intervenor related to the granted return on equity.

If certain criteria are met, Ameren
Illinois’ natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to the consumer. Also, Ameren Illinois has approval from the ICC to use cost
recovery mechanisms for energy efficiency programs and bad debt expense not recovered in base rates.

For additional information on
Illinois rate matters, including the IEIMA and the ICC’s January 2012 natural gas rate order, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II,
Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Merchant Generation









General Regulatory Matters

Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, including to issue short-term debt securities and to conduct certain

acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations involving electric utility holding companies having a value in excess of $10 million. In addition, these Ameren
utilities must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities (with maturities of more than 12 months) and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other

activities. Genco and AERG are subject to FERC’s jurisdiction when they issue any securities and when they enter into certain other transactions,
including those listed above.

Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, ATXI, Genco and AERG are also subject to mandatory reliability
standards, including cybersecurity standards, adopted by FERC to ensure the reliability of the bulk power electric system. These standards are developed and enforced by NERC pursuant to authority given to it by the FERC. If the Ameren Companies were
found not to be in compliance with any of these mandatory reliability standards they may incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.

Under PUHCA 2005, FERC and any state public utility regulatory agencies may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are determined to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s
rate-regulated subsidiaries with respect to jurisdictional rates. PUHCA 2005 also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren companies.

Operation of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway energy center is subject to regulation by the NRC. Its facility operating license expires on
June 11, 2024. In December 2011, Ameren Missouri submitted a license extension application with the NRC to extend the plant’s operating license to 2044. There is no date by which the NRC must act on this relicensing request. Ameren
Missouri’s Osage hydroelectric energy center and Ameren Missouri’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other things, the
general operation and maintenance of the projects. The license for Ameren Missouri’s Osage hydroelectric energy center expires on March 30, 2047. In June 2008, Ameren Missouri filed a relicensing application with FERC to operate its Taum
Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center for another 40 years. The existing FERC license expired on June 30, 2010. On July 2, 2010, Ameren Missouri received a license extension that allows Taum Sauk to continue operations until FERC
issues a new license. FERC is reviewing the relicensing application. A FERC order is expected in 2012 or 2013. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the order. Ameren Missouri’s Keokuk energy center and its dam, in the
Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa, are operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

For additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and
Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report, which include a discussion about the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at Ameren Missouri’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center.

Environmental Matters

Certain
of our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental statutes or regulations relating to the safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment. These environmental statutes and regulations include requirements for
identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, reporting, and emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials; safety and health standards; and environmental protection
requirements, including standards and limitations relating to the discharge of air and water pollutants and the management of waste and byproduct materials. Failure to comply with those statutes or regulations could have material adverse effects on
us. We could be subject to criminal or civil penalties by regulatory agencies or we could be ordered by the courts to pay private parties. Except as indicated in this report, we believe that we are in material compliance with existing statutes and
regulations.

In addition to existing laws and regulations, including the Illinois MPS, which govern our
facilities, the EPA is developing numerous new environmental regulations that will have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. These regulations could be particularly burdensome for certain companies, including Ameren, Ameren
Missouri and Genco, that operate coal-fired energy centers. Significant new rules proposed or promulgated since the beginning of 2010 include the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions; revised national ambient air quality standards for SO


and NO


emissions; the CSAPR, which requires further reduction of SO


and
NO

x

emissions from power plants; a regulation governing management of CCR and
coal ash impoundments; the MATS, which reduces emissions of mercury, metals, and acid gases from power plants; revised NSPS for particulate matter, SO


, and
NO

x

emissions from new sources; and new regulations under the Clean Water Act
that could require significant capital expenditures such as new water intake structures or cooling towers at our energy centers. The EPA also plans to propose an additional rule, applicable to new and existing electric generating units, governing
NSPS and emission guidelines for greenhouse gas emissions. These new regulations may be litigated, so the timing of their implementation is uncertain, as evidenced by the stay of the CSAPR by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia on December 30, 2011. Although many details of these future regulations are unknown, the combined effects of the new and proposed environmental regulations may result in significant capital expenditures and/or increased operating costs
over the next five to ten years for Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco. Actions required to ensure that our









facilities and operations are in compliance with environmental laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive. If they are, these regulations could require us to

close or to significantly alter the operation of our energy

centers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, including the impairment of plant assets. Failure to
comply with environmental laws and regulations might also result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and injunctive measures.

For additional discussion of environmental matters, including NOx, SO2, and mercury emission reduction
requirements, global climate change, remediation efforts, and a discussion of the EPA’s allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law in connection with projects at certain coal-fired energy centers, see Liquidity and Capital
Resources in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

TRANSMISSION AND SUPPLY OF ELECTRIC POWER

Ameren owns an integrated transmission system that comprises the transmission assets of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Ameren also operates two balancing authority areas, AMMO (which includes Ameren
Missouri), and AMIL (which includes Ameren Illinois, ATXI, Genco excluding EEI and Genco’s Elgin CT facility, and AERG). During 2011, the peak demand was 8,831 megawatts in AMMO and 9,605 megawatts in AMIL. The Ameren transmission system
directly connects with 15 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy.

Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and
ATXI are transmission-owning members of MISO. Transmission service on the Ameren transmission systems is provided pursuant to the terms of the MISO OATT on file with FERC. EEI operates its own balancing authority area and its own transmission
facilities in southern Illinois. The EEI transmission system is directly connected to MISO, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Louisville Gas and Electric Company. EEI’s generating units are dispatched separately from those of Ameren Missouri,
Genco and AERG.

FERC, in its order issued in May 2011, approved transmission rate incentives for the Illinois Rivers project and the
Big Muddy project, which will be developed by ATXI or ATX. In December 2011, MISO approved the Illinois Rivers project as well as the Spoon River and Mark Twain projects. The total investment in these three MISO-approved projects is expected to be
more than $1.2 billion through 2019, with potential investment of approximately $750 million from 2012 to 2016. All four projects are in Missouri and Illinois. Construction will begin first on the Illinois Rivers project. The Big Muddy project
is currently being evaluated for inclusion in MISO’s 2012 expansion plan.

The Ameren Companies and EEI are members of SERC. SERC
is responsible for the bulk electric power supply

system in all or portions of Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Virginia, Florida, Oklahoma, Iowa, and
Texas. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, owners and operators of the bulk electric power system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and its regional entities, such as SERC, which are enforced by FERC. The
Ameren Companies must follow these standards, which are in place to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric power system.

See Note
2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.

Ameren Missouri

Ameren Missouri’s electric supply is obtained primarily from its own generation. Factors that could cause Ameren Missouri to purchase power
include, among other things, absence of sufficient owned generation, energy center outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy portfolio requirements, the failure of suppliers to meet their power supply obligations, extreme weather conditions, and
the availability of power at a cost lower than the cost of generating it.

Ameren Missouri continues to evaluate its longer-term needs
for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity. Ameren Missouri’s integrated resource plan filed with the MoPSC in February 2011 included the expectation that new baseload generation capacity would be required between 2020 and 2030.
Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, Ameren Missouri continues to study future plant alternatives, as well as energy efficiency programs that could help defer new plant
construction. To prepare for the long-term need for baseload capacity, and to prepare for potentially more stringent environmental regulation of coal-fired energy centers, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets, Ameren
Missouri is taking steps to preserve options to meet future demand. These steps include seeking improvements in regulatory treatment of energy efficiency investments, evaluating potential sites for natural gas-fired generation, and pursuing an early
site permit for an additional unit at its existing nuclear plant site. Ameren Missouri’s pursuit of an early site permit is dependent upon enactment of a legislative framework ensuring cost recovery.

See also Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and
Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Ameren
Illinois

Any electric supply purchased by Ameren Illinois for its retail customers comes either through an annual procurement
process conducted by the IPA or through









markets operated by MISO. The power and relatedprocurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are
passed directly to its customers through a cost recovery mechanism.The IPA administers a RFP process that procures Ameren
Illinois’ expected supply obligation. Since the start of this process, the ICC has approved the outcomes of multiple electric power procurement RFPs for energy, capacity, and renewable energy credits covering different time periods.A portion of the electric power supply required for Ameren Illinois to satisfy its distribution customers’ requirements is purchased in the
RFP process administered by the IPA from Marketing Company on behalf of Genco and AERG. In addition, as part of the 2007 Illinois Electric Settlement Agreement, Ameren Illinois entered into financial contracts with Marketing Company (for the benefit
of Genco and AERG) to lock in energy prices for 400 to 1,000 megawatts annually of its round-the-clock power requirements during the period June 1, 2008, through December 31, 2012, at the market prices relevant at that time. These
financial contracts do not include capacity, are not load-following products, and do not involve the physical delivery of energy.

See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 14 – Related Party Transactions and Note
15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on power procurement in Illinois.Merchant GenerationGenco and AERG have
entered into power supply agreements with Marketing Company whereby Genco and AERG sell, and Marketing Company purchases, all of the capacity and energy available from Genco’s and AERG’s generation energy centers and the associated energy.
These power supply agreements continue through December 31, 2022, and from year to year thereafter unless either party elects to terminate the agreement by providing the other party with no less than six months’ advance written notice. EEI
and Marketing Company have entered into a power supply agreement for EEI to sell all of its capacity and energy to Marketing Company. This agreement expires on May 31, 2016. All of Genco’s, AERG’s and EEI’s energy centers compete
for the sale of energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through Marketing Company. See Note 14 – Related Party Transactions under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.

Coal

Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco have agreements in place to purchase a portion of their coal needs and to transport it to electric generating energy centers through 2019. Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco expect
to enter into additional contracts to purchase coal from time to time. Coal supply agreements typically have an initial term of up to five years, with about 20% of the contracts expiring annually. Ameren Missouri has an ongoing need for coal to
serve its native load customers and pursues a price hedging strategy consistent with this requirement. Merchant Generation’s forward coal requirements are dependent on the volume of power sales that have been contracted. Merchant Generation
strives to achieve increased margin certainty by aligning its fuel purchases with its power sales. Ameren burned 39 million tons (Ameren Missouri – 22 million, Genco – 13 million) of coal in 2011. See Part II, Item 7A –
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about coal supply contracts.

About 98% of Ameren’s coal (Ameren Missouri – 97%, Genco – 99%) is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The remaining
coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin. Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco have a goal to maintain coal inventory consistent with their risk management policies. Inventory may be adjusted because of changes in burn or uncertainties of
supply due to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. In the past, deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail maintenance, weather, and

derailments. As of December 31, 2011, coal inventories for Ameren Missouri were at targeted levels and were at or above targeted levels for Genco. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause
Ameren, Ameren Missouri and Genco to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources.NuclearThe steps in the process to
provide nuclear fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, the enrichment of that gas, and the fabrication of the enriched uranium
hexafluoride gas into usable fuel assemblies. Ameren Missouri has entered into uranium, uranium conversion, enrichment, and fabrication contracts to procure the fuel supply for its Callaway nuclear plant.Fuel assemblies for the 2013 spring refueling at Ameren Missouri’s Callaway energy center are scheduled for manufacture and
delivery to the plant during 2012. Ameren Missouri also has agreements or inventories toprice-hedge approximately 92%, 82%, and 47% ofCallaway’s 2013, 2014 and 2016 refueling requirements, respectively. Ameren Missouri has uranium (concentrateand hexafluoride) inventories and supply contractssufficient to
meet all of its uranium and conversionrequirements through at least 2014. Ameren Missouri has enriched uranium inventories and enrichment supply









contracts sufficient to satisfy enrichment requirements through 2013. Fuel fabrication services are under contract through 2014. Ameren Missouri expects to enter into additional contracts to
purchase nuclear fuel. As a member of Fuelco, Ameren Missouri can join with other member companies to increase its purchasing power, enhance diversification and pursue opportunities for volume discounts. The Callaway nuclear plant normally requires
refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling was completed in November 2011. There is no refueling scheduled for 2012 and 2015. The nuclear fuel markets are competitive, and prices can be volatile; however, we do not anticipate any
significant problems in meeting our future supply requirements.

Natural Gas Supply for Generation

To maintain gas deliveries to gas-fired generating units throughout the year, especially during the summer peak demand, Ameren’s portfolio of
natural gas supply resources includes firm transportation capacity and firm no-notice storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines. Ameren Missouri and Genco primarily use the interstate pipeline systems of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company,
Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation to transport natural gas to generating units. In addition to physical transactions, Ameren uses financial instruments, including some in
the NYMEX futures market and some in the OTC financial markets, to hedge the price paid for natural gas.

Ameren Missouri’s and
Genco’s natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to their generating units. This is accomplished by optimizing transportation and storage options and minimizing cost and price risk
through various supply and price-hedging agreements that allow access to multiple gas pools, supply basins, and storage services. As of December 31, 2011, Ameren Missouri had price-hedged about 12% and Genco had price-hedged 32% of its expected
natural gas supply requirements for generation in 2012.

Renewable Energy

Illinois and Missouri have enacted laws requiring electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. Illinois requires
renewable energy resources to equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers as of June 1, 2008, increasing to 15% by June 1, 2015, and to 25% by June 1, 2025. Ameren
Illinois has procured renewable energy credits under the IPA-administered procurement process to meet the renewable energy portfolio requirement through May 2012. In December 2010, Ameren Illinois entered into a 20-year agreement with renewable
energy suppliers and will begin receiving renewable energy credits under the agreement starting in June 2012, to help supplement these requirements. Approximately 50% of the 2012 renewable energy requirement will be met through this agreement. In
2011,

Ameren Illinois procured approximately 6% of its total electricity from renewable energy resources.

In Missouri, utilities are required to purchase or generate from renewable energy sources electricity equaling at least 2% of native load sales, with that percentage increasing to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a
1% limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each renewable energy portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. Ameren Missouri expects to satisfy the nonsolar requirement through 2017 with existing renewable generation in its
current fleet along with a 15-year 102 MW power purchase agreement with a wind farm operator in Iowa that became effective in 2009 and the landfill gas project discussed below. Currently, Ameren Missouri expects to meet the solar energy requirement
through the purchase of solar-generated renewable energy credits; however, Ameren Missouri is studying other options for compliance. In 2011, Ameren Missouri purchased or generated approximately 3% of its native load sales from renewable energy
resources.

In September 2009, Ameren Missouri announced an agreement with a landfill owner to install CTs at a landfill site in
Maryland Heights, Missouri, which is expected to generate approximately 15 megawatts of electricity by burning methane gas collected from the landfill. The CTs (known as the Maryland Heights energy center) are expected to begin generating power in
2012. Ameren Missouri signed a 20-year supply agreement with the landfill owner to purchase methane gas.

Energy Efficiency

Ameren’s rate-regulated utilities have implemented energy efficiency programs to educate and help their customers become more efficient users
of energy. The MEEIA, enacted in 2009, established a regulatory framework that, among other things, allows electric utilities to recover costs related to MoPSC-approved energy efficiency programs. The law requires the MoPSC to ensure that a
utility’s financial incentives are aligned with helping customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective energy efficiency programs. Missouri does not
have a law mandating energy efficiency standards.

In January 2012, Ameren Missouri made its initial filing with the MoPSC under the
MEEIA. This filing proposes a three-year plan that includes a portfolio of energy efficiency programs along with a cost recovery mechanism. If the proposal is approved, beginning in January 2013, Ameren Missouri plans to invest $145 million
over three years for the proposed energy efficiency programs. A decision by the MoPSC in this proceeding is anticipated in the second quarter of 2012. Ameren Missouri anticipates that the impacts of the MoPSC’s decision in this MEEIA filing
will be included in rates set under its pending electric service rate case that was filed on February 3, 2012, which has an anticipated true-up date of July 31, 2012. Ameren Missouri’s pending electric rate case includes an annual
revenue increase of









$81 million relating to its planned portfolio of energy efficiency programs included in its MEEIA filing. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of
this report for additional information.

Illinois has enacted a law requiring Ameren Illinois to offer energy efficiency programs. The
law also allows recovery mechanisms of the programs’ costs. The ICC has issued orders approving Ameren Illinois’ electric and natural gas energy efficiency plans as well as cost recovery mechanisms by which program costs can be recovered
from customers. In addition, over a ten-year period, Ameren Illinois will invest an estimated $625 million to upgrade and modernize its transmission and distribution infrastructure in accordance with the IEIMA. As part of these upgrades, Ameren
Illinois expects to invest $360 million to install smart meters, which could enable customers to improve efficiency.

INDUSTRY ISSUES

We are facing issues common to the electric and natural gas utility industry and the merchant electric generation industry. These issues include:



Ÿcontinually developing and complex environmental laws, regulations and issues, including air and water quality standards, mercury emissions standards, and likely
greenhouse gas limitations and ash management requirements;

Ÿpolitical and regulatory resistance to higher rates, especially in a difficult economic environment;

Ÿthe potential for changes in laws, regulation, and policies at the state and federal level, including those resulting from election cycles;

Ÿaccess to, and uncertainty in, the capital and credit markets;

Ÿthe potential for more intense competition in generation, supply and distribution, including new technologies;

Ÿpressure on customer growth and usage in light of current economic conditions and energy efficiency initiatives;

Ÿthe potential for reregulation in some states, which could cause electric distribution companies to build or acquire generation facilities and to purchase less
power from electric generating companies such as Genco and AERG;

Ÿchanges in the structure of the industry as a result of changes in federal and state laws, including the formation of merchant generators, independent
transmission entities and RTOs;

Ÿincreases, decreases and volatility in power prices due to the balance of supply and demand and marginal fuel costs;

Ÿthe availability of fuel and increases or decreases in fuel prices;

Ÿthe availability of qualified labor and material, and rising costs;

Ÿregulatory lag;

Ÿdecreased or negative free cash flows due to rising infrastructure investments and regulatory frameworks;

Ÿpublic concern about the siting of new facilities;

Ÿaging infrastructure and the need to construct new power generation, transmission and distribution facilities;

Ÿlegislation or proposals for programs to encourage or mandate energy efficiency and renewable sources of power;

Ÿpublic concerns about nuclear plant operation and decommissioning and the disposal of nuclear waste; and

Ÿconsolidation of electric and natural gas companies.









We are monitoring these issues. Except as otherwise noted in this report, we are unable to predict
what impact, if any, these issues will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity. For additional information, see Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, and Outlook in

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 – Commitments
