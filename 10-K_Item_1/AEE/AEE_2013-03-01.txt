BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Ameren has three reporting segments: Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, and Merchant Generation. See Note 18 – Segment Information under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on reporting segments.



RATES AND REGULATION

Rates

The rates that Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are











The ICC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Illinois and ATXI. The MoPSC regulates rates and other matters for Ameren Missouri. The FERC regulates Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, ATXI, Genco, EEI, and AERG as to their ability to charge market-based rates for the sale and transmission of energy in interstate commerce and various other matters discussed below under General Regulatory Matters.

About 53% of Ameren’s electric and 15% of its natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2012. About 29% of Ameren’s electric and 85% of its natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31, 2012. Wholesale revenues for Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, Genco, Marketing Company and AERG are subject to FERC regulation, but not subject to direct MoPSC or ICC regulation.

Ameren Missouri

Electric

Almost 100% of Ameren Missouri’s electric operating revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2012.

In December 2012, the MoPSC issued an order approving an increase for Ameren Missouri in annual revenues for electric service of $260 million, including $84 million related to an anticipated increase in normalized net fuel costs above the net fuel costs included in base rates previously authorized by the MoPSC in its July 2011 electric rate order. The annual increase



also included $80 million for recovery of the costs associated with energy efficiency programs under the MEEIA. The remaining annual increase of $96 million approved by the MoPSC was for energy infrastructure investments and other non-fuel costs, including $10 million for increased pension and other post-employment benefit costs and $6 million for increased amortization of regulatory assets. The revenue increase was based on a 9.8% return on equity, a capital structure composed of 52.3% common equity, and a rate base of $6.8 billion. The new rates became effective on January 2, 2013.

If certain criteria are met, Ameren Missouri’s electric rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. The FAC permits 95% of prudently incurred fuel, emission allowances, purchased power costs, transmission costs and MISO costs and revenues to be passed directly to customers. The MoPSC's December 2012 electric rate order changed the FAC to include activated carbon, limestone and urea costs, along with transmission revenues, starting in 2013.

FERC regulates the rates charged and the terms and conditions for electric transmission services. Each RTO separately files a regional transmission tariff for approval by FERC. All transmission service within that RTO is then subjected to that tariff. As a member of MISO, Ameren Missouri’s transmission rate is calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. The transmission rate is updated in June of each year; it is based on Ameren Missouri’s filings with FERC. This rate is not directly charged to Missouri retail customers, because in Missouri the MoPSC includes transmission-related costs and revenues in setting bundled retail rates.

Natural Gas

All of Ameren Missouri’s natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the MoPSC in the year ended December 31, 2012. In January 2011, the MoPSC approved a stipulation and agreement that allowed Ameren Missouri to increase annual natural gas revenues by $9 million.

If certain criteria are met, Ameren Missouri’s natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to customers. The ISRS also permits prudently incurred natural gas infrastructure replacement costs to be passed directly to customers. The return on equity to be used by Ameren Missouri for purposes of the ISRS tariff filing is 10%.

For additional information on Missouri rate matters, including Ameren Missouri’s 2012 electric rate order and the related court appeals, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.











Ameren Illinois

Electric

About 99% of Ameren Illinois’ electric operating revenues were subject to regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31, 2012, with the remainder subject to FERC regulation.

Under the Illinois Customer Choice Law, all electric customers in Illinois may choose their own electric energy provider. However, Ameren Illinois is required to serve as the provider of last resort (POLR) for electric customers within its territory who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier. Ameren Illinois’ obligation to provide POLR electric service varies by customer size. Ameren Illinois is not required to offer fixed-priced electric service to customers with electric demands of 400 kilowatts or greater, as the market for service to this group of customers has been declared competitive. Power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its customers through a cost recovery mechanism.

In 2012, Ameren Illinois elected to participate in the performance-based formula ratemaking process established pursuant to the IEIMA by filing initial performance-based formula rates with the ICC. The IEIMA was designed to provide for the recovery of actual costs of electric delivery service that are prudently incurred and to reflect the utility's actual regulated capital structure through the inclusion of a formula for calculating the return on equity component of the cost of capital. The return on equity component of the formula rate is equal to the average for the calendar year of the monthly yields of 30-year United States treasury bonds plus 590 basis points for 2012 and 580 basis points thereafter. Ameren Illinois' actual return on equity relating to electric delivery service will be subject to a collar adjustment on earnings in excess of 50 basis points above or below its allowed return. The IEIMA provides for an annual reconciliation of the revenue requirement necessary to reflect the actual costs incurred in a given year with the revenue requirement that was in effect for that year, including an allowed return on equity. This annual revenue reconciliation, along with the collar adjustment, if necessary, will be collected from or refunded to customers in a subsequent year.

Ameren Illinois is also subject to performance standards under the IEIMA. Failure to achieve the standards will result in a reduction in the company's allowed return on equity calculated under the formula. The performance standards include improvements in service reliability to reduce both the frequency and duration of outages, reduction in the number of estimated bills, reduction of consumption on inactive meters, and a reduction in uncollectible accounts expense. The IEIMA provides for return on equity penalties totaling up to 30 basis points in 2013 through 2015, 34 basis points in 2016 through 2018, and 38 basis points in 2019 through 2022 if the performance standards are not met. The formula ratemaking process is effective until the end of 2017, but could be extended by the Illinois General Assembly for an additional five years. The formula ratemaking



process would also terminate if the average residential rate increases by more than 2.5% annually from June 2011 through May 2014.  The average residential rate includes generation service, which is outside of Ameren Illinois’ control, as Ameren Illinois is required to purchase all of its power through procurement processes administered by the IPA.

Between 2012 and 2021, Ameren Illinois is required, pursuant to the IEIMA, to invest $625 million in capital expenditures incremental to Ameren Illinois' average electric delivery capital expenditures for calendar years 2008 through 2010 to modernize its distribution system. Such investments are expected to encourage economic development and to create an estimated 450 additional jobs within Illinois. Ameren Illinois is subject to monetary penalties if 450 additional jobs are not created during the peak program year. Also, Ameren Illinois is required to contribute $1 million annually for certain nonrecoverable customer assistance programs and $1 million annually to the Illinois Science and Energy Innovation Trust for as long as Ameren Illinois participates in the formula ratemaking process. Ameren Illinois also was required to make a one-time $7.5 million nonrecoverable donation to the Illinois Science and Energy Innovation Trust in 2012.

In April 2012, Ameren Illinois submitted to the ICC an update filing under IEIMA based on 2011 recoverable costs and expected net plant additions for 2012. In December 2012, the ICC issued an order approving an Ameren Illinois electric delivery service revenue requirement of $764 million, which was a $15 million decrease in the revenue requirement allowed in the ICC











initial filing order. The rates became effective on January 1, 2013, and will be effective through the end of 2013. Ameren Illinois will submit to the ICC during the second quarter of 2013 an update filing based on 2012 recoverable costs and expected net plant additions for 2013, which will determine rates that are effective during 2014.

In December 2012, the ICC approved Ameren Illinois' advanced metering infrastructure deployment plan, which outlines how Ameren Illinois will comply with the IEIMA requirement to spend $360 million on smart grid assets over ten years on a cost-beneficial basis to its electric customers. The plan targets the second quarter of 2014 to begin installation of smart meters.

Also, Ameren Illinois has approval from the ICC to use cost recovery mechanisms for energy efficiency programs, environmental costs and bad debt expense not recovered in base rates.

Ameren Illinois has a tariff rider to recover the costs of asbestos-related litigation claims, subject to the following terms: 90% of cash expenditures in excess of the amount included in base electric rates are to be recovered from a trust fund that was established when Ameren acquired IP. At December 31, 2012, the trust fund balance was $23 million, including accumulated interest. If cash expenditures are less than the amount in base rates, Ameren Illinois will contribute 90% of the difference to the fund. Once the trust fund is depleted, 90% of allowed cash expenditures in excess of base rates will be recovered through charges assessed to customers under the tariff rider. Following the Ameren Illinois Merger, this rider is applicable only for claims that occurred within IP’s historical service territory. Similarly, the rider will permit recovery only from customers within IP’s historical service territory.

As a member of MISO, Ameren Illinois' transmission rates are calculated in accordance with the MISO OATT. Ameren Illinois has received FERC approval to use company-specific, forward-looking rate formula templates in setting its transmission rates. These forward-looking rates are updated in January each year based on forecasted information, with an annual reconciliation to the actual revenue requirement based on the costs incurred. In Illinois, the AMIL pricing zone rate is charged directly to wholesale customers and alternative retail electric suppliers, which serve unbundled retail load. For Ameren Illinois retail customers who have not chosen an alternative retail electric supplier, the AMIL transmission rate, as well as other MISO-related costs, are collected through a rider mechanism in Ameren Illinois' retail distribution tariffs.

Natural Gas

All of Ameren Illinois’ natural gas operating revenues were subject to regulation by the ICC in the year ended December 31, 2012.

On January 25, 2013, Ameren Illinois filed a request with the ICC to increase its annual revenues for natural gas delivery service by $50 million.  The request was based on a 10.4% return



on equity, a capital structure composed of 51.8% common equity, and a rate base of $1.1 billion. In an attempt to reduce regulatory lag, Ameren Illinois is using a future test year, 2014, in this proceeding. A decision by the ICC in this proceeding is required by December 2013. Ameren Illinois cannot predict the level of any delivery service rate changes the ICC may approve, when any rate changes may go into effect, or whether any rate changes that may eventually be approved will be sufficient to enable Ameren Illinois to recover its costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments when the rate changes go into effect.

If certain criteria are met, Ameren Illinois’ natural gas rates may be adjusted without a traditional rate proceeding. PGA clauses permit prudently incurred natural gas costs to be passed directly to the customer. Also, Ameren Illinois has approval from the ICC to use cost recovery mechanisms for energy efficiency programs, certain environmental costs and bad debt expense not recovered in base rates.

For additional information on Illinois rate matters, including the IEIMA and the Ameren Illinois' natural gas case filed in January 2013, see Results of Operations and Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk under Part II, Item 7A, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Merchant Generation











Part II, Item 7 and Note 7 – Derivative Financial Instruments under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

General Regulatory Matters

Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, Genco, AERG and Marketing Company must receive FERC approval to enter into various transactions, including to issue short-term debt securities and to conduct certain acquisitions, mergers, and consolidations involving electric utility holding companies having a value in excess of $10 million. In addition, these Ameren utilities must receive authorization from the applicable state public utility regulatory agency to issue stock and long-term debt securities (with maturities of more than 12 months) and to conduct mergers, affiliate transactions, and various other activities.

Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois, Genco, AERG and ATXI are also subject to mandatory reliability standards, including cybersecurity standards, adopted by FERC to ensure the reliability of the bulk power electric system. These standards are developed and enforced by NERC pursuant to authority given to it by the FERC. If Ameren or its subsidiaries were found not to be in compliance with any of these mandatory reliability standards, they could incur substantial monetary penalties and other sanctions.

Under PUHCA 2005, FERC and any state public utility regulatory agencies may access books and records of Ameren and its subsidiaries that are determined to be relevant to costs incurred by Ameren’s rate-regulated subsidiaries with respect to jurisdictional rates. PUHCA 2005 also permits the MoPSC and the ICC to request that FERC review cost allocations by Ameren Services to other Ameren companies.

Operation of Ameren Missouri’s Callaway energy center is subject to regulation by the NRC. Its facility operating license expires on June 11, 2024. In December 2011, Ameren Missouri submitted a license extension application with the NRC to extend the energy center's operating license to 2044. There is no date by which the NRC must act on this relicensing request. Ameren Missouri’s Osage hydroelectric energy center and Ameren Missouri’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center, as licensed projects under the Federal Power Act, are subject to FERC regulations affecting, among other things, the general operation and maintenance of the projects. The license for Ameren Missouri’s Osage hydroelectric energy center expires on March 30, 2047. In June 2008, Ameren Missouri filed a relicensing application with FERC to operate its Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center for another 40 years. The existing FERC license expired on June 30, 2010. On July 2, 2010, Ameren Missouri received a license extension that allows Taum Sauk to continue operations until FERC issues a new license. FERC is reviewing the relicensing application. A FERC order is expected in 2013 or 2014. Ameren Missouri cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the order. Ameren Missouri’s Keokuk energy center and its dam in the Mississippi River between Hamilton, Illinois, and Keokuk, Iowa are operated under authority granted by an Act of Congress in 1905.

For additional information on regulatory matters, see Note 2



– Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 10 - Callaway Energy Center, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report, which include a discussion about the December 2005 breach of the upper reservoir at Ameren Missouri’s Taum Sauk pumped-storage hydroelectric energy center.

Environmental Matters

Certain of our operations are subject to federal, state, and local environmental statutes or regulations relating to the safety and health of personnel, the public, and the environment. These environmental statutes and regulations include requirements for identification, generation, storage, handling, transportation, disposal, recordkeeping, labeling, reporting, and emergency response in connection with hazardous and toxic materials; safety and health standards; and environmental protection requirements, including standards and limitations relating to the discharge of air and water pollutants, the protection of natural and cultural resources, and the management of waste and byproduct materials. Failure to comply with those statutes or regulations could have material adverse effects on us. We could be subject to criminal or civil penalties by regulatory agencies or we could be ordered by the courts to pay private parties. Except as indicated in this report, we believe that we are in material compliance with existing statutes and regulations.

In addition to existing laws and regulations, including the Illinois MPS that applies to AER's energy centers in Illinois, the EPA is developing environmental regulations that will have a significant impact on the electric utility industry. These regulations could be particularly burdensome for certain companies, including Ameren, Ameren Missouri, Genco, and AERG, that operate coal-fired energy centers.  Significant new rules proposed or promulgated since the beginning of 2010 include the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions; revised national ambient air quality standards for SO


and NO


emissions; the CSAPR, which would have required further reductions of SO


emissions, NO

x

emissions, and fine particulate matter emissions from energy centers; a regulation that governs management of CCR and coal ash impoundments; the MATS, which require reduction of emissions of mercury, toxic metals, and acid gases from energy centers; revised NSPS for particulate matter, SO


, and NO

x

emissions from new sources; and new regulations under the Clean Water Act that could require significant capital expenditures, such as for new water intake structures or cooling towers, at our energy centers. The EPA has proposed CO


limits for new coal-fired and natural gas-fired combined cycle units and is expected to propose limits for existing units in the future. These new and proposed regulations, if adopted, may be challenged through litigation, so their ultimate implementation as well as the timing of any such implementation is uncertain, as evidenced by the CSAPR being vacated and remanded back to the EPA by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in August 2012. Although many details of these future regulations are unknown, the combined effects of the new and proposed environmental regulations may result in significant capital expenditures and/or increased operating costs over the next five to ten years for Ameren, Ameren Missouri and AER. Compliance











with these environmental laws and regulations could be prohibitively expensive. If they are, these regulations could require us to close or to significantly alter the operation of our energy centers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and liquidity, including the impairment of long-lived assets. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations might also result in the imposition of fines, penalties, and injunctive measures.

The decision to make pollution control equipment investments at our Merchant Generation business depends on whether the expected future market price for power reflects the increased cost for environmental compliance. During early 2012, the observable market price for power for delivery in that year and in future years sharply declined below 2011 levels primarily because of declining natural gas prices, as well as the impact from the stay of the CSAPR. As a result of this sharp decline in the market price for power, as well as uncertain environmental regulations, Genco decelerated the construction of two scrubbers at its Newton energy center.

For additional discussion of environmental matters, including NOx, SO2, and mercury emission reduction requirements, remediation efforts, and a discussion of the EPA’s allegations of violations of the Clean Air Act and Missouri law in connection with projects at Ameren Missouri's Rush Island energy center, and the EPA's Notice of Violation of permitting requirements at Genco's Newton energy center, see Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.



TRANSMISSION AND SUPPLY OF ELECTRIC POWER

Ameren owns an integrated transmission system that comprises the transmission assets of Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and ATXI. Ameren also operates two balancing authority areas, AMMO (which includes Ameren Missouri), and AMIL (which includes Ameren Illinois, ATXI, AERG, and Genco excluding EEI and Genco’s Elgin CT energy center). During 2012, the peak demand was 8,868 megawatts in AMMO and 9,720 megawatts in AMIL. The Ameren transmission system directly connects with 15 other balancing authority areas for the exchange of electric energy.

Ameren Missouri, Ameren Illinois and ATXI are transmission-owning members of MISO. Transmission service on the Ameren transmission system is provided pursuant to the terms of the MISO OATT on file with FERC. EEI operates its own balancing authority area and its own transmission facilities in southern Illinois. The EEI transmission system is directly connected to the transmission systems of MISO, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and Louisville Gas and Electric Company. EEI’s energy centers are dispatched separately from those of Ameren Missouri, Genco and AERG.  Ameren Missouri is authorized by the MoPSC to participate in MISO, subject to certain conditions, through May 2016.



In May 2011 FERC approved transmission rate incentives for the Illinois Rivers project, which is being developed by ATXI. In December 2011, MISO approved the Illinois Rivers project as well as the Spoon River and Mark Twain projects. The total investment in these three MISO-approved projects is expected to be more than $1.3 billion from 2013 to 2019. These projects are located primarily in Illinois and Missouri.

In February 2012, FERC approved ATXI's request for a forward-looking rate calculation with an annual reconciliation adjustment, as well as ATXI's request for implementation of the incentives FERC approved in its May 2011 order for the Illinois Rivers project. In November 2012, FERC approved transmission rate incentives for the Spoon River project and the Mark Twain project. FERC also approved a forward-looking rate calculation with an annual reconciliation adjustment for Ameren Illinois' electric transmission business.

The Ameren Companies and EEI are members of SERC. SERC is responsible for the bulk electric power supply system in all or portions of Missouri, Illinois, Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Virginia, Florida, Oklahoma, Iowa, and Texas. As a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, owners and operators of the bulk electric power system are subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by NERC and its regional entities, such as SERC, which are enforced by FERC. The Ameren Companies must comply with these standards, which are in place to ensure the reliability of the bulk electric power system.

See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.

Ameren Missouri

Ameren Missouri’s electric supply is obtained primarily from its own generation. Factors that could cause Ameren Missouri to purchase power include, among other things, absence of sufficient owned generation, energy center outages, the fulfillment of renewable energy portfolio requirements, the failure of suppliers to meet their power supply obligations, extreme weather conditions, and the availability of power at a cost lower than the cost of generating it.

Ameren Missouri continues to evaluate its longer-term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity. The MoPSC's December 2012 electric rate order approved Ameren Missouri's implementation of MEEIA megawatthour savings targets, energy efficiency programs, and associated cost recovery mechanisms and incentive awards. The order allows for Ameren Missouri to collect its program costs and 90% of its projected lost revenue from customers over the same three-year period starting on January 2, 2013. The remaining 10% of projected lost revenue is expected to be recovered as part of future rate proceedings.The potential need for new generating plant construction is dependent on several key factors including: continuation of energy efficiency programs beyond 2015, load growth, customer participation in energy efficiency programs, and the potential for more stringent environmental regulation of coal-











fired energy centers, which could lead to the retirement of current baseload assets. Because of the significant time required to plan, acquire permits for, and build a baseload power plant, Ameren Missouri continues to study future plant alternatives and is taking steps to preserve options to meet future demand. These steps include evaluating the potential for further energy efficiency programs in the long term, evaluating potential sites for natural gas-fired generation, and pursuing DOE funds through a partnership with Westinghouse for development of small modular reactor technology for nuclear power. Ameren Missouri's next Integrated Resource Plan filing with the MoPSC is due October 1, 2014.

See also Outlook in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Part II, Item 7, and Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report.

Ameren Illinois

Any electric supply purchased by Ameren Illinois for its retail customers comes either through an annual procurement process conducted by the IPA or through markets operated by MISO. The power and related procurement costs incurred by Ameren Illinois are passed directly to its customers through a cost recovery mechanism.

The IPA administers a RFP process that procures Ameren Illinois’ expected supply obligation. Since the RFP process began in 2009, the ICC has approved the outcomes of multiple electric power procurement RFPs for energy, capacity, and renewable energy credits covering different time periods.

A portion of the electric power supply required for Ameren Illinois to satisfy its distribution customers’ requirements is



purchased in the RFP process administered by the IPA from Marketing Company, on behalf of Genco and AERG, and from Ameren Missouri.

Under Illinois law, transmission and distribution service rates are regulated, while electric customers are allowed to purchase generation from an alternative retail electric supplier. At December 31, 2012, approximately 396,000 retail customers representing approximately 61% of Ameren Illinois' annual retail kilowatthour sales had elected to purchase their electricity from an alternative retail electric supplier. Customers who receive electricity from an alternative retail electric supplier continue to pay a delivery charge to Ameren Illinois for the distribution services they receive from Ameren Illinois.

See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters, Note 14 – Related Party Transactions and Note 15 – Commitments and Contingencies under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information on power procurement in Illinois.

Merchant Generation

Genco and AERG have entered into power supply agreements with Marketing Company whereby Genco and AERG sell, and Marketing Company purchases, all of the capacity and energy available from Genco’s and AERG’s energy centers. These power supply agreements continue through December 31, 2022, and from year to year thereafter unless either party elects to terminate the agreement by providing the other party with no less than six months’ advance written notice. EEI and Marketing Company have entered into a power supply agreement for EEI to sell all of its capacity and energy to Marketing Company. This agreement expires on May 31, 2016. All of Genco’s, AERG’s and EEI’s energy centers compete for the sale of energy and capacity in the competitive energy markets through Marketing Company.

(a)The fuel cost for coal represents the cost of coal, the costs for transportation, which include railroad diesel fuel additives, and the cost of emission allowances.

(b)The fuel cost for natural gas represents the cost of natural gas and firm and variable costs for transportation, storage, balancing, and fuel losses for delivery to the plant. In addition, the fixed costs for firm transportation and firm storage capacity are included in the calculation of fuel cost for the energy centers.

(c)Represents all costs for fuels used in our energy centers, to the extent applicable, including coal, nuclear, natural gas, methane gas, oil, propane, tire chips, paint products, and handling. Oil, propane, tire chips, and paint products are not individually listed in this table because their use is minimal.

Coal

Ameren Missouri and the Merchant Generation business have agreements in place to purchase a portion of the coal they need and to transport it to energy centers through 2019. Ameren Missouri and Merchant Generation expect to enter into additional contracts to purchase coal from time to time. Coal supply agreements for Ameren Missouri have terms of up to six years, and expire between 2014 and 2017. Ameren Missouri has an ongoing need for coal to serve its native load customers, so it pursues a price hedging strategy consistent with this requirement. Merchant Generation's forward coal requirements and coal supply agreements are dependent on the volume of power sales contracted. Merchant Generation strives to achieve increased margin certainty by aligning its fuel purchases with its power sales. Ameren burned 34 million tons (Ameren Missouri – 19 million, Merchant Generation – 15 million) of coal in 2012. See Part II, Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about coal supply contracts.

About 97% of Ameren’s coal (Ameren Missouri – 97%, Merchant Generation – 97%) is purchased from the Powder River Basin in Wyoming. The remaining coal is typically purchased from the Illinois Basin. Ameren Missouri and Merchant Generation have a goal to maintain coal inventory consistent with their risk management policies. Inventory may be adjusted because of changes in burn or uncertainties of supply due to potential work stoppages, delays in coal deliveries, equipment breakdowns, and other factors. In the past, deliveries from the Powder River Basin have occasionally been restricted because of rail maintenance, weather, and derailments.  As of December 31, 2012, coal inventories for Ameren Missouri and for Merchant Generation were at or above targeted levels. Disruptions in coal deliveries could cause Ameren Missouri and Merchant Generation to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low-margin periods, buying higher-cost fuels to



generate required electricity, and purchasing power from other sources.

Nuclear

The steps in the process to provide nuclear fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates, the conversion of uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride gas, the enrichment of that gas, and the fabrication of the enriched uranium hexafluoride gas into usable fuel assemblies. Ameren Missouri has entered into uranium, uranium conversion, uranium enrichment, and fabrication contracts to procure the fuel supply for its Callaway nuclear energy center.

Fuel assemblies for the 2013 spring refueling at Ameren Missouri's Callaway energy center were manufactured and were delivered to the energy center in January 2013. Ameren Missouri also has agreements or inventories to price-hedge approximately 99%, 52%, and 46% of Callaway's 2014, 2016 and 2017 refueling requirements, respectively. Ameren Missouri has uranium (concentrate and hexafluoride) inventories and supply contracts sufficient to meet all of its uranium and conversion requirements at least through 2017. Ameren Missouri has enriched uranium inventories and enrichment supply contracts sufficient to satisfy enrichment requirements through at least 2017. Fuel fabrication services are under contract through 2014.Ameren Missouri expects to enter into additional contracts to purchase nuclear fuel. As a member of Fuelco, Ameren Missouri can join with other member companies to increase its purchasing power, enhance diversification, and pursue opportunities for volume discounts. The Callaway energy center normally requires refueling at 18-month intervals. The last refueling was completed in November 2011. There is no refueling scheduled for 2015 and 2018. The nuclear fuel markets are competitive, and prices can be volatile; however, we do not anticipate any significant problems in meeting our future supply requirements.











Natural Gas Supply for Generation

To maintain deliveries to natural gas-fired energy centers throughout the year, especially during the summer peak demand, Ameren’s portfolio of natural gas supply resources includes firm transportation capacity and firm no-notice storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines. Ameren Missouri and Merchant Generation primarily use the interstate pipeline systems of Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, and Mississippi River Transmission Corporation to transport natural gas to energy centers. In addition to physical transactions, Ameren uses financial instruments, including some in the NYMEX futures market and some in the OTC financial markets, to hedge the price paid for natural gas.

Ameren Missouri’s and Merchant Generation's natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas to their energy centers. This is accomplished by optimizing transportation and storage options and minimizing cost and price risk through various supply and price-hedging agreements that allow access to multiple gas pools, supply basins, and storage services. As ofDecember 31, 2012, Ameren Missouri had price-hedged about34% and Merchant Generation had price hedged59% of its expected natural gas supply requirements for generation in 2013.

Renewable Energy

Illinois and Missouri have enacted laws requiring electric utilities to include renewable energy resources in their portfolios. Illinois requires renewable energy resources to equal or exceed 2% of the total electricity that each electric utility supplies to its eligible retail customers as of June 1, 2008, with that percentage increasing to 10% by June 1, 2015, and to 25% by June 1, 2025. In 2012, Ameren Illinois procured approximately 8% of its total electricity from renewable energy resources. Ameren Illinois has procured renewable energy credits under the IPA-administered procurement process to meet the renewable energy portfolio requirement through at least May 2017. In December 2010, Ameren Illinois entered into 20-year agreements with renewable energy suppliers and commenced receiving renewable energy credits under these agreements in June 2012. Approximately 54% of the 2013 plan year renewable energy requirement will be met through these agreements. The remaining requirement will be met through IPA procurements, which resulted in contracts that were executed in February 2012 with a term of June 2013 through December 2017.

In Missouri, utilities are required to purchase or generate from renewable energy sources electricity equaling at least 2% of native load sales, with that percentage increasing to at least 15% by 2021, subject to a 1% annual limit on customer rate impacts. At least 2% of each renewable energy portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy. Ameren Missouri expects to satisfy the nonsolar requirement through 2017 with its existing renewable generation, including the Maryland Heights energy center, along with a 15-year 102-megawatt power purchase agreement with a wind farm operator in Iowa that became



effective in 2009. Currently, Ameren Missouri expects to meet the solar energy requirement through the purchase of solar-generated renewable energy credits, and generation from solar panels installed on Ameren's general office building. However, Ameren Missouri is studying other options for compliance. In 2012, Ameren Missouri purchased or generated approximately 3% of its native load sales from renewable energy resources.

In 2012, Ameren Missouri began generating power at its Maryland Heights energy center.  This energy center, located at a landfill in Maryland Heights, Missouri, has the capability to generate up to approximately 15 megawatts of electricity by burning methane gas collected from the landfill.  Ameren Missouri signed a 20-year supply agreement with the landfill owner to purchase methane gas.

Energy Efficiency

Ameren’s rate-regulated utilities have implemented energy efficiency programs to educate and help their customers become more efficient users of energy. The MEEIA established a regulatory framework that, among other things, allows electric utilities to recover costs related to MoPSC-approved energy efficiency programs. The law requires the MoPSC to ensure that a utility’s financial incentives are aligned to help customers use energy more efficiently, to provide timely cost recovery, and to provide earnings opportunities associated with cost-effective energy efficiency programs. Missouri does not have a law mandating energy efficiency standards.

The MoPSC's December 2012 electric rate order approved Ameren Missouri's implementation of MEEIA megawatthour savings targets, energy efficiency programs, and associated cost recovery mechanisms and incentive awards. Beginning in 2013, Ameren Missouri will invest approximately $147 million over the next three years for energy efficiency programs. The order allows for Ameren Missouri to collect its program costs and 90% of its projected lost revenue from customers over the same three years starting on January 2, 2013. The remaining 10% of projected lost revenue is expected to be recovered as part of future rate proceedings.

Additionally, the order provides for an incentive award that would allow Ameren Missouri to earn additional revenues based on achievement of certain energy efficiency goals, including approximately $19 million if 100% of its energy efficiency goals are achieved during the three-year period, with the potential to earn more if Ameren Missouri's energy savings exceed those goals. Ameren Missouri must achieve at least 70% of its energy efficiency goals before it earns any incentive award. The recovery of the incentive award from customers, if the energy efficiency goals are achieved, would begin after the three-year energy efficiency plan is complete and upon the effective date of an electric service rate order or possibly with the future adoption of a rider mechanism. See Note 2 – Rate and Regulatory Matters under Part II, Item 8, of this report for additional information.

Illinois has enacted a law requiring Ameren Illinois to offer energy efficiency programs. The law also allows recovery mechanisms of the programs’ costs. The ICC has issued orders











approving Ameren Illinois’ electric and natural gas energy efficiency plans as well as cost recovery mechanisms by which program costs can be recovered from customers. In addition, over a ten-year period, Ameren Illinois will invest an estimated $625 million to upgrade and modernize its transmission and distribution infrastructure in accordance with the IEIMA. As part of these upgrades, Ameren Illinois expects to invest $360 million to install smart meters, which could enable customers to improve efficiency.NATURAL GAS SUPPLY FOR DISTRIBUTIONAmeren Missouri and Ameren Illinois are responsible for the purchase and delivery of natural gas to their utility customers. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois develop and manage a portfolio of natural gas supply resources. These include firm gas



supply under term agreements with producers, interstate and intrastate firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity leased from interstate pipelines, and on-system storage facilities to maintain natural gas deliveries to customers throughout the year and especially during peak demand periods. Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois primarily use Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, Trunkline Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, Mississippi River Transmission Corporation, Northern Border Pipeline Company, and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation interstate pipeline systems to transport natural gas to their systems. In addition to transactions requiring physical delivery, financial instruments, including those entered into in the NYMEX futures market and in the OTC financial markets, are used to hedge the price paid for natural gas. See Part II, Item 7A – Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk of this report for additional information about natural gas supply contracts. Natural gas purchase costs are passed on to customers of Ameren Missouri and Ameren Illinois under PGA clauses, subject to prudency reviews by the MoPSC and the ICC. As ofDecember 31, 2012, Ameren Missouri had price-hedged89%, and Ameren Illinois had price-hedged81%, of its expected natural gas supply requirements for distribution in 2013.

INDUSTRY ISSUES

We are facing issues common to the electric and natural gas utility industry and the merchant electric generation industry. These issues include:

•continually developing and complex environmental laws, regulations and issues, including air and water quality standards, mercury emissions standards, and likely greenhouse gas limitations and CCR management requirements;

•political and regulatory resistance to higher rates;

•the potential for changes in laws, regulations, and policies at the state and federal level;

•access to, and uncertainty in, the capital and credit markets;

•cybersecurity risk, including loss of operational control of energy centers and electric and natural gas transmission and distribution systems and/or loss of data, and compliance with related industry regulations;

•the potential for more intense competition in generation, supply and distribution, including new technologies;

•pressure on customer growth and usage in light of current economic conditions and energy efficiency initiatives;

•the potential for reregulation in some states, which could cause electric distribution companies to build or acquire energy centers and to purchase less power from electric generation companies such as Genco and AERG;

•changes in the structure of the industry as a result of changes in federal and state laws, including the formation and growth of independent transmission entities;

•increases, decreases, and volatility in power prices due to the balance of supply and demand and marginal fuel costs;

•weakened financial strength of merchant generators, especially those with coal-fired energy centers, including their ability to generate positive cash flows in competitive markets as they seek to comply with environmental regulations;

•the availability of fuel and increases or decreases in fuel prices;

•the availability of qualified labor and material, and rising costs;

•regulatory lag;

•the influence of macroeconomic factors, such as yields on United States treasury securities, on allowed rates of return on equity provided by regulators;

•decreased or negative free cash flows due to rising infrastructure investments and regulatory frameworks;

•public concern about the siting of new facilities;

•aging infrastructure and the need to construct new power generation, transmission and distribution facilities, which have long time frames to completion, while at the same time, having little long-term visibility on power and commodity prices;

•legislation or proposals for programs to encourage or mandate energy efficiency and renewable sources of power;

•public concerns about nuclear generation and decommissioning and the disposal of nuclear waste; and

•consolidation of electric and natural gas companies.











We are monitoring these issues. Except as otherwise noted in this report, we are unable to predict what impact, if any, these issues will have on our results of operations, financial position, or liquidity.
