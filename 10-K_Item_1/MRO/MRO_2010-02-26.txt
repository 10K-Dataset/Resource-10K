Item 1. Business

General

Marathon Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo,
Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the
next paragraph (the “USX Separation”), USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

Before
December 31, 2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock (“Steel Stock”),
which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation
(“United States Steel”) to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.

In connection with the USX Separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001, and Marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date.

On June 30, 2005, we acquired the 38 percent ownership interest in Marathon Ashland Petroleum LLC (“MAP”) previously held
by Ashland Inc. (“Ashland”). In addition, we acquired a portion of Ashland’s Valvoline Instant Oil Change business, its maleic anhydride business, its interest in LOOP LLC which owns and operates the only U.S. deepwater oil port, and
its interest in LOCAP LLC which owns a crude oil pipeline. As a result of the transactions, MAP is wholly owned by Marathon and its name was changed to Marathon Petroleum Company LLC (“MPC”) effective September 1, 2005.

On October 18, 2007, we acquired all the outstanding shares of Western Oil Sands Inc. (“Western”). Western’s primary
asset was a 20 percent interest in the outside-operated Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”), an oil sands mining joint venture located in the province of Alberta, Canada. The acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of
accounting and, as such, our results of operations include Western’s results from October 18, 2007. Western’s oil sands mining and bitumen upgrading operations are reported as a separate Oil Sands Mining







segment, while its ownership interests in leases where in-situ recovery techniques are expected to be utilized are included in the Exploration and Production segment.

Segment and Geographic Information

Our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production (“E&P”) – explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a worldwide basis; 2) Oil Sands Mining
(“OSM”) – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil; 3) Integrated Gas (“IG”) – markets and
transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and methanol, on a worldwide basis; and 4) Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”) – refines, transports and markets crude
oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.

The E&P, OSM and IG segments comprise our upstream operations. The RM&T segment comprises our downstream operations.

Exploration and Production

In the discussion that follows regarding our exploration and production operations, references to “net” wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.

At the end of 2009, we were conducting oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in eight countries: the United States,
Angola, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Libya, Norway and the United Kingdom. During 2009, we exited Gabon and Ireland. We plan to begin exploration activities in Poland during 2010.

Our 2009 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 243 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”). Our 2009 worldwide net
natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and subsequent resale, averaged 941 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”). In total, our 2009 worldwide net sales averaged 400 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per
day (“mboepd”). For purposes of determining barrels of oil equivalent (“boe”), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet
(“mcf”) by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe. These volumes exclude 7 mboepd related to discontinued operations.

In the United States during 2009, we drilled 76 gross (50 net) exploratory wells of which 72 gross (48 net) wells encountered commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 72 wells, 6 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. Internationally, we drilled 9 gross (1 net) exploratory wells of which 6 gross (1 net) wells encountered commercial
quantities of hydrocarbons. All 6 wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at December 31, 2009.

North America

United States– Our U.S. operations accounted for 26 percent of our 2009
worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 40 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes.

Offshore –
The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area. During 2009, our net sales in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 24 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 20 mmcfd of natural gas. At year end 2009, we held interests in seven producing fields and four platforms in
the Gulf of Mexico, of which we operate one platform.

We operate the Ewing Bank 873 platform which is located 130 miles south
of New Orleans, Louisiana. The platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the Lobster, Oyster and Arnold fields. The facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs.

We own a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated Petronius field on Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830. An additional development well was
successfully completed in 2009. The Petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields.







The Neptune development commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in July
2008. We hold a 30 percent working interest in this outside-operated development located on Atwater Valley 575, 120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The completed Phase I development included six subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform.
Phase II development activities have begun and the first well in this program was successfully drilled and completed in late 2009.

Development of the Droshky discovery, located on Green Canyon Block 244, continued in 2009. Droshky Phase I is a four well liquid hydrocarbon development with first production targeted for mid-year 2010. Ongoing development activities
include running intelligent well completions, installation of the subsea facilities and topside modifications to the third-party Bullwinkle host platform. Expected net peak production is approximately 50 mboepd. We hold a 100 percent operated
working interest in Droshky.

Development of the Ozona prospect, located on Garden Banks Block 515, has also continued. We
have secured a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby third-party Auger platform. First production is expected in 2011. We hold a 68 percent working interest in Ozona.

In 2008, we drilled a successful liquid hydrocarbon appraisal well on the Stones prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 508. We hold a 25
percent interest in the outside-operated Stones prospect. In the third quarter of 2008, we announced deepwater liquid hydrocarbon discovery on the Gunflint prospect located on Mississippi Canyon Block 948. We own a 13 percent interest in this
outside-operated prospect. In the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater liquid hydrocarbon discovery on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 52. We own a 20 percent interest in the outside-operated prospect. In
December 2009, we began drilling the Flying Dutchman well, on Green Canyon Block 511, where we have 63 percent ownership and are the operator of this liquid hydrocarbon prospect.

In addition to the prospects listed above, we held interests in 103 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of 2009, including 97 in the
deepwater area. Our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in 2010 and 2011.

Onshore – We produce
natural gas in the Cook Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. We have operated and outside-operated interests in 10 fields and hold a 51 to 100 percent working interest in each. In 2009, our net natural gas sales from Alaska averaged 87
mmcfd. Typically, our natural gas sales from Alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and first quarters. To manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce
and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the Kenai natural gas field. In 2009, we drilled six wells in Alaska and plan to drill four to six wells per year during 2010 through 2012.

We hold leases with natural gas production in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, located in Garfield County in the Greater Grand Valley field
complex. Our plans include drilling approximately 65 wells over the next five years. We currently have one operated drilling rig running and averaged net sales of 15 mmcfd in 2009.

We hold 336,000 acres over the Bakken Shale oil play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota with a working interest of approximately 84
percent. Approximately 225 locations will be drilled over the next four to five years. We are evaluating other potential horizons above and below the Middle Bakken. We currently have four operated drilling rigs running in our Bakken program. We
exited 2009 with average net sales of 11 mboepd in December.

In 2008, we successfully completed our first horizontal well in
the Woodford Shale natural gas play in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma. We are currently participating in additional horizontal wells in the area where we hold 52,000 net acres. In 2009, we drilled 13 wells, five of which were operated. We plan to
drill 10 to 15 wells in 2010.

We also have domestic natural gas operations in Oklahoma, east Texas and north Louisiana, with
combined net sales of 121 mmcfd in 2009, and liquid hydrocarbon operations in the Permian Basin of west Texas, with net sales of 8 mbpd in 2009. In June 2009, we completed the sales of our operated and a portion of our outside-operated Permian Basin
producing assets in New Mexico and west Texas. We still retain interests in 12 Permian Basin fields.

We hold acreage in two
additional emerging shale resource plays in the U.S. In the Appalachian Basin we hold 70,000 net acres in the Marcellus Shale natural gas play in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. We drilled five wells







in 2009 and plan to drill another 8 to 12 wells in 2010. In Louisiana and east Texas, we hold 25,000 net acres in the Haynesville Shale natural gas play, where we drilled one well in 2009. We
plan to drill three to four wells in 2010.

Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our Wyoming fields averaged 18
mbpd and 113 mmcfd in 2009. We plan to drill 24 wells in 2010.

Canada– We hold interests in both operated and
outside-operated exploration stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of Western in 2007. The three potential in-situ developments are Namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest, Birchwood, in which we hold a 100
percent operated interest, and Ells River, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest. Initial test drilling on the Birchwood prospect positively confirmed bitumen presence with additional test drilling required to confirm reservoir
quality.

Africa

Equatorial Guinea– We own a 63 percent operated working interest in the Alba field which is offshore Equatorial Guinea. During 2009, net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 42 mbpd, or 17
percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales averaged 426 mmcfd, or 45 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2009 included 30 mbpd of primary condensate.

We also own a 52 percent interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum
gas (“LPG”) processing plant. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price for the British thermal units used in the operations of the LPG plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from
the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and LPG. During 2009, a gross 943 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the LPG production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2009 included 4 mbpd of secondary
condensate and 12 mbpd of LPG produced by Alba Plant LLC.

We hold a 63 percent operated interest in the Deep Luba and Gardenia discoveries on the Alba Block and we are the
operator with a 90 percent interest in the Corona well on Block D. These wells are part of our long-term LNG strategy. We expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby Alba field starts to decline.

Angola–Offshore Angola, we hold 10 percent interests in Block 31 and Block 32, both of which are
outside-operated. The discoveries on Blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential development hubs. The Plutao, Saturno, Venus and Marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of Block
31. In 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater development project, called the PSVM development. The PSVM development will utilize a floating, production, storage and offloading (“FPSO”) vessel. A total of 48
production and injection wells are planned with the drilling of the first three to four development wells planned in 2010. First production is anticipated in late 2011 to early 2012. Other discoveries on Block 31 comprise potential development areas
in the southeast and middle portions of the block. Eight of the Block 32 discoveries form a potential development in the eastern area of that block. We expect first production on Block 32 in 2015 or 2016.







Libya– We hold a 16 percent interest in the outside-operated Waha concessions,
which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin. Our exploration program in 2009 included the drilling of four wells. One well is waiting on completion, one was dry and abandoned, and two are currently drilling. We also
drilled 5 development wells in Libya during the year. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya averaged 46 mbpd in 2009. The 2009 net liquid hydrocarbon sales in Libya represented 19 percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes. Net
natural gas sales in Libya averaged 4 mmcfd in 2009.

Our Faregh Phase II Gas Plant project is expected to deliver a gross 180
mmcfd of natural gas and 15 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons into the Libyan domestic market. Commissioning will begin in 2010, with startup planned for first quarter of 2011.

Europe

Norway– Norway is a growing core area, which
complements our long-standing operations in the U.K. sector of the North Sea discussed below. We were approved for our first operatorship on the offshore Norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate eight licenses and hold interests
in over 600,000 gross acres.

The operated Alvheim complex located on the Norwegian continental shelf commenced production in
June 2008. The complex consists of an FPSO with subsea infrastructure. Improved reliability, combined with optimization work, increased the throughput of the FPSO to 142 mbpd, up from the original design of 120 mbpd. Produced oil is transported by
shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is transported to the existing U.K. Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”) system using a 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. First production to the complex was from the Alvheim
development which is comprised of the Kameleon, East Kameleon and Kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the Boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. At the end of 2009, the Alvheim development included
ten producing wells and two water disposal wells. A Phase 2 drilling program targeting three additional production wells, and a Phase 2b drilling program with two additional production wells, is planned in 2010 through 2012. Net sales for 2009
averaged 56 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 30 mmcfd of natural gas.

The nearby outside-operated Vilje field, in which we own
a 47 percent working interest, began producing through the Alvheim complex in August 2008. During 2009, net liquid hydrocarbon sales from Vilje averaged 12 mbpd.

In June 2009, we completed the drilling program for the Volund field as a subsea tieback to the Alvheim complex. The Volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated interest, is located
approximately five miles south of the Alvheim area and consists of one production well and one water disposal well. First production from Volund was announced in September 2009. The Volund owners have contracted for 25 gross mbpd (16 mbpd net) firm
capacity on the Alvheim FPSO beginning in July 2010. Until that date, Volund will act as a swing producer, filling any available capacity and allowing the FPSO to be fully utilized.

Also offshore Norway, we and our partners announced the Marihone and Viper discoveries, both located within tie-back distance of the Alvheim
FPSO. The Marihone oil discovery is located in license PL340 about 12 miles south of the Volund and Alvheim fields. We hold a 65 percent operated working interest in Marihone. The Viper oil discovery is located immediately next to Volund field in
PL203, about 12 miles south of the Alvheim FPSO. We are the operator and hold a 65 percent interest in Viper. Conceptual development studies for both discoveries have begun.

In addition, we hold a 28 percent interest in the outside-operated Gudrun field, located 120 miles off the coast of Norway. In January 2009,
the operator announced a development concept that includes a fixed processing platform with seven production wells that would be tied to existing facilities on the Sleipner field, and one water disposal well.

United Kingdom– Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and
have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae A platform and facilities host the underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central and West
Brae fields. A two well development program is scheduled in 2010 for West Brae. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field, which is produced via the East Brae platform, are natural gas condensate
fields. The East Brae platform hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest. Net liquid hydrocarbon sales from the Brae area







averaged 11 mbpd in 2009. Net Brae natural gas sales averaged 101 mmcfd, or 11 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes, in 2009.

The strategic location of the Brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and
transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 28 third-party fields have contracted to use the Brae system. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact on
Brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex.

The Brae group owns a
50 percent interest in the outside-operated Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”) system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion
cubic feet (“bcf”) per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.

In the U.K. Atlantic Margin west of the Shetland Islands, we own an average 30 percent working interest in the outside-operated Foinaven
area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. Net sales from the Foinaven fields averaged 13 mbpd of
liquid hydrocarbons and 7 mmcfd of natural gas in 2009. We are upgrading the FPSO which will extend the life of this project through 2021.

We have a 45 percent interest in five exploratory U.K. onshore coal seam gas licenses. Drilling has been completed in five exploration wells in three of the licenses. We also hold a 55 percent operated
working interest in 11 blocks awarded in a 2008 bid round. Our interest covers 520,000 gross acres.

Poland– We
have recently added a new opportunity to our portfolio, Poland shale gas. In November we were awarded the 296,000 acre Kwidzyn Block, followed by the 249,000 acre Orzechow Block in December. The five and a half year exploration phase for each block
includes 2D seismic and at least one well. We were awarded the 269,000 acre Brodnica Block in January 2010, and we continue to look for additional opportunities in Poland. We hold a 100 percent interest and operatorship in all three blocks.

Other International

Indonesia– We are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the Pasangkayu Block offshore Indonesia. The block is located mostly in deep water, predominantly offshore of the island of
Sulawesi in the Makassar Strait, directly east of the Kutei Basin production region. The production sharing contract with the Indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3D seismic acquisition in May 2008. A mandatory 25 percent
relinquishment was submitted to the Indonesian government in September 2009 and upon approval, the block size will be reduced from 1.2 million gross acres to 872,400 gross acres. We expect to drill two wells in 2010.

In October 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the Bone Bay Block offshore Sulawesi. An increase in ownership to
55 percent is pending Indonesian government approval. The Bone Bay Block covers an area of 1.23 million acres and is 200 miles southeast of our Pasangkayu Block. Current exploration plans for Bone Bay call for the acquisition of seismic data
starting in 2010, followed by drilling of one exploration well in 2011. In the second quarter of 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the Kumawa Block, our third Indonesia offshore exploration block, located offshore West
Papua. An increase in ownership to 55 percent is pending Indonesian government approval. The Kumawa Block encompasses 1.24 million acres. A 2D seismic survey is planned in the first quarter of 2010 and we expect to drill one exploration well in
2011-2012.

We are the operator of a drilling rig consortium, with five other operators, that has secured a deepwater
exploration drilling rig to drill exploratory wells in Indonesia over a two-year period commencing in the second quarter of 2010. The participants have the right to extend this rig contract for up to one additional year.

We continue to participate in joint study agreements in Indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. We completed
two joint study agreements in 2008 and have one in progress.

Divestitures

Angola –In February 2010, we closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent interest in the outside-operated production sharing
contract and joint operating agreement on Block 32 offshore Angola for $1.3 billion, excluding any purchase price adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2009. We retained a 10 percent interest in Block 32.







Gabon –In December 2009, we closed the sale of our operated properties in
Gabon. Net production from these operations averaged 6 mbpd in 2009. The results of our Gabonese operations have been reported as discontinued operations.

United States –In June 2009, we completed the sale of our operated and a portion of our outside-operated Permian Basin producing assets in New Mexico and west Texas for net proceeds after
closing adjustments of $293 million. A $196 million pretax gain on the sale was recorded. Net production from these sold properties averaged 8,150 boepd in the first quarter of 2009.

Ireland– In April 2009, we closed the sale of our operated properties offshore Ireland, which consisted of our 100 percent
working interest in the Kinsale Head, Ballycotton and Southwest Kinsale natural gas fields and our 87 percent working interest in the Seven Heads natural gas field. Net production from these operations averaged 5 mboepd in the first quarter of 2009.

In July 2009 we closed the sale of our subsidiary holding our 19 percent interest in the outside-operated Corrib natural gas
development offshore Ireland. As a result of these dispositions, our Irish exploration and production businesses have been reported as discontinued operations.

The above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future exploratory and development drilling, the timing of production from the Droshky and Ozona
developments in the Gulf of Mexico, the Faregh Phase II Gas Plant, the PSVM development on Block 31 offshore Angola and Block 32 and other possible developments. Some factors which could potentially affect these forward-looking statements include
pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or
terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary
government and third-party approvals and permits. The offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience.
The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Oil
Sands Mining

Through our acquisition of Western in 2007, we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the AOSP, an
oil sands mining joint venture located in Alberta, Canada. The joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil. The
AOSP’s mining and extractions assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta and include the Muskeg River mine which began bitumen production in 2003 and the Jackpine mine which is currently under construction and anticipated to commence
bitumen production in the second half of 2010. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta. The upgrading assets are located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton,
Alberta. Additional upgrading capacity is being constructed with an anticipated startup in late 2010 or early 2011.







In the second quarter of 2009, the operator of AOSP offered three additional leases to the
other joint venture partners for the Muskeg River mine. Terms of the transaction were as agreed in the original 1999 AOSP joint venture agreement. We elected to participate in these leases and our net proved bitumen reserves increased
168 million barrels. See Item 1. Business – Reserves for comprehensive discussion of reserves related to our oil sands mining and conventional exploration and production operations. As of December 31, 2009, we have rights to
participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross (45,000 net) acres.

Current AOSP
operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. The mined ore passes through
primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles. The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. The slurry moves through the extraction
process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for
the upgrader to run efficiently. The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile Corridor Pipeline.

The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen
molecules into lighter products. Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products. The three major products that the Scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil, heavy synthetic crude oil
and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace.

Net synthetic crude oil sales were 32 mbpd in both 2009 and 2008, but were 4 mbpd in 2007. Daily volumes for 2007 represent total volumes
since the acquisition date over total days in the period.

Prior to our acquisition of Western, the first fully integrated
expansion of the existing AOSP facilities was approved in 2006. Expansion 1, which includes construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, addition of a new
processing train at the Scotford upgrading facility and development of related infrastructure, is on track and anticipated to begin mining operations in the second half of 2010, and upgrader operations in late 2010 or early 2011. When Expansion 1 is
complete, we will have more than 50 mbpd of production and upgrading capacity in the Canadian oil sands. The timing and scope of potential future expansions and debottlenecking opportunities on existing operations remain under review.

The above discussion of the Oil Sands Mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the anticipated completion of AOSP
Expansion 1 and the timing of production. Factors which could affect the expansion project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions
imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects. The AOSP expansion could be further affected by commissioning and start-up risks associated with prototype equipment and new
technology.

Reserves

In December 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced revisions to its regulations on oil and gas reporting. In January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting standards update
which was intended to harmonize the accounting literature with the SEC’s new regulations. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of the changes. The
revised regulations were applied in estimating and reporting our reserves as of December 31, 2009, which totaled 1,679 mmboe.

Estimated Reserve Quantities

The following table sets forth estimated quantities of our net proved
liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2009. Approximately 61 percent of our proved reserves
are located in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) countries.







Under the new regulations, reserves are now disclosed by continent, by country, if the
proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil-equivalent barrel basis represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent.
Reserve quantities previously reported for 2008 and 2007 have been reorganized into these geographic groupings below for comparability.

(a)Before December 31, 2009, reserves related to oil sands mining were not included in the SEC’s definition of oil and gas producing activities;
therefore, these reserves are not reported for 2008 and 2007.

(b)Our businesses in Ireland and Gabon were sold in 2009. All periods have been recast to reflect these businesses as discontinued operations.

We previously reported OSM segment reserves as bitumen because oil sands mining was not considered an oil
and gas producing activity by the SEC. Proved bitumen reserves reported as of December 31, 2008 and 2007 were 388 mmboe and 421 mmboe. December 31, 2009 reserve quantities under the new regulations include 603 mmboe of proved synthetic
crude oil (bitumen after upgrading excluding blendstocks) related to our oil sands mining operations. While the change from bitumen to synthetic crude oil is responsible for some of the 2008 to 2009 increase in reported OSM segment reserves, the
majority of the reserve increase is related to the three leases added to the Muskeg River mine in the second quarter of 2009. There were no other significant changes to our proved reserves in 2009.

The above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a
number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions,
levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. The above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known physical data, economic
recoverability and operating conditions. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. For additional details of the estimated quantities of proved reserves at
the end of each of the last three years, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data— Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.

Preparation of Reserve Estimates

Our estimation of net recoverable
quantities of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience professionals. All estimates are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X.
Beginning December 31, 2009, reserve estimates are based upon the average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month period ended December 31, 2009. In previous periods, reserve estimates were based on prices at
December 31.

Liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our
Corporate Reserves Group, which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and her staff of Reserves Coordinators. Reserves estimates are developed and reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators (“QRE”). QRE are engineers or geoscientists
with a minimum of a bachelor of science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of 3 years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed Marathon’s Qualified Reserve Estimator training
course. The Reserve Coordinators review all reserves estimates for all fields with proved reserves greater than 3 million boe at a minimum of once every 3 years. Any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 million boe on a
total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the Director of Corporate Reserves. All other proved reserve changes must be approved by a Reserve Coordinator.







Our Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer, has a
bachelor of science degree in petroleum engineering and a master of business administration. Her 35 years of experience in the industry include 24 with Marathon. She is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the Society of
Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”) Oil and Gas Reserves Committee (“OGRC”) since 2004, chairing in 2008 and 2009. As a member of the OGRC, she participated in the development of the Petroleum Resource Management System
(“PRMS”) and served on the Technical Program Committee for a 2007 SPE Reserves Estimation Workshop: Sharing the Vision focusing on PRMS. She chaired the development of the OGRC comments on the SEC’s proposed modernization of oil and
gas reporting and was a member of the American Petroleum Institute’s Ad Hoc group that provided comments on the same topic.

Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants of Calgary, Canada, third-party consultants. A copy of their report is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. The engineer responsible for the estimates
of our oil sands mining reserves has 31 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. He is a member of SPE, having served as regional director 1998 through 2001 and is a registered
Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta.

Audits of Estimates

Third-party consultants are engaged to audit the in-house reserve estimates for fields that comprise the top 80 percent of our total proved
reserves over a rolling four-year period. We met this goal for the four-year period ended December 31, 2009. We established a tolerance level of 10 percent for reserve audits such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are
accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional
data and refine their analysis if appropriate. This resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. This process did not result in significant changes to our reserve estimates in 2009, 2008, or 2007.

Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) prepared an independent estimate of December 31, 2008 reserves for Alba field.
This reserve estimate was used by Corporate Reserves in much the same way third-party audits are now used. The NSAI summary report is filed as Exhibit 99.2 to this Form 10-K. The senior members of the NSAI team have over fifty years of industry
experience between them, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. The team lead has a master of science in mechanical engineering and is a member of SPE. The senior technical advisor has a bachelor of science
in geophysics and is a member of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the European Association of Geoscientists and Engineers. Both are licensed in the state of Texas.

Ryder Scott Company (“Ryder Scott”) performed audits of several of our fields in 2009. Their summary report on audits performed in
2009 is filed as Exhibit 99.3 to this Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 18 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining Ryder Scott. He has a bachelor of science in
mechanical engineering, is a member of SPE and is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Texas.

The Corporate
Reserves Group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance
or changes in economic or operating conditions.

Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves

As of December 31, 2009, 492 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, an increase of 203 mmboe from December 31, 2008,
primarily due to the inclusion of synthetic crude oil. Of the 492 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves at year end 2009, 31 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. The
majority of this volume is related to a compression project in Equatorial Guinea that was sanctioned by the Board of Directors in 2004 and is expected to be completed in 2014. There are no other significant undeveloped reserves expected to be
developed more than five years from now. Projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in many situations such as behind-pipe zones where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large
development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. During 2009, we added 290 mmboe to proved undeveloped reserves and transferred 38 mmboe from proved undeveloped to proved
developed reserves. Costs incurred for the periods ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $792 million, $1,189 million and $1,250 million.







As of December 31, 2009, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the
years 2010 through 2014 are projected to be $1,083 million, $565 million, $244 million, $331 million, and $123 million.

The
above estimated future development costs relating to the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among
others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations,
production experience and other operating considerations. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates.

Integrated Gas

Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production operations. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are
the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas.

We
hold a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. In May 2007, EGHoldings completed construction of a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum (“mmtpa”) LNG production facility on Bioko
Island. LNG from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the
Henry Hub index, regardless of destination. This production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves from the Alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the Alba field participants under a long-term natural gas
supply agreement. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.9 million metric tonnes in 2009. In 2009, we continued discussions with the government of Equatorial Guinea and our partners regarding a potential second LNG
production facility on Bioko Island.

We also own a 30 percent interest in a Kenai, Alaska, natural gas liquefaction plant,
and lease two 87,500 cubic meter tankers used to transport LNG to customers in Japan. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from a portion of our natural gas production in the Cook Inlet. From the first production in 1969, we have sold our share of
the LNG plant’s production under long-term contracts with two of Japan’s largest utility companies. In June 2008 we, along with our partner, received approval from the U.S. Department of Energy to extend the export license for this natural
gas liquefaction plant through March 2011.

We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which is accounted for under the equity
method of accounting. AMPCO owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied from our natural gas production from the Alba field. Gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 960,374 metric tonnes in
2009. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the United States.

In addition to our expertise in
utilizing existing gas technologies to manufacture and market products such as LNG and methanol, we continue to conduct research to develop new leading-edge natural gas technologies. While existing known natural gas resources are much more abundant
than the world’s remaining oil resources, natural gas is more difficult to transport to global markets without the use of advanced gas technologies. Our Gas-to-Fuels (“GTF™”) technology is one such promising technology.

Our GTFTMtechnology program is focused on converting natural gas into gasoline blendstocks and petrochemicals. Global markets
for these products are significantly larger than the global markets for either LNG or methanol, further expanding the uses of natural gas. During 2009, we completed the initial run program of our newly-constructed GTF process demonstration unit,
which was commissioned during 2008. This technology demonstration program has provided valuable information about materials of construction, process chemistry, and GTF plant operations.

During 2008, we entered into agreements with GRT, Inc., a Delaware corporation, to cooperate on the advancement of gas-to-fuels-related
technology. This transaction provides us with access to additional specialized







technical and research personnel and lab facilities, and significantly expanded the portfolio of patents available to us via license and through a cooperative development program. In addition, we
have acquired a 20 percent interest in GRT, Inc.

The GTFTMtechnology is protected by an intellectual property protection program. The U.S. has granted 17 patents
for the technology, with another 22 pending. Worldwide, there are over 300 patents issued or pending, covering over 100 countries including regional and direct foreign filings.

Another innovative technology that we are developing focuses on reducing the processing and transportation costs of natural gas by
artificially creating natural gas hydrates, which are more easily transportable than natural gas in its gaseous form. Much like LNG, gas hydrates would then be regasified upon delivery to the receiving market. We have an active pilot program in
place to test and further develop a proprietary natural gas hydrates manufacturing system.

The above discussion of the
Integrated Gas segment contains forward-looking statements with respect to the possible expansion of the LNG production facility. Factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the LNG production facility include partner and
government approvals, access to sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual
results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

We have refining, marketing and transportation operations concentrated primarily in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and Southeast
regions of the U.S. We rank as the fifth largest crude oil refiner in the U.S. and the largest in the Midwest. Our operations include a seven-plant refining network and an integrated terminal and transportation system which supplies wholesale and
Marathon-brand customers as well as our own retail operations. Our wholly-owned retail marketing subsidiary Speedway SuperAmerica LLC (“SSA”) is the third largest chain of company-owned and -operated retail gasoline and convenience stores
in the U.S. and the largest in the Midwest.

Refining

We own and operate seven refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1.188 million barrels per day (“mmbpd”) of crude
oil as of December 31, 2009. During 2009, our refineries processed 957 mbpd of crude oil and 196 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. The table below sets forth the location and daily crude oil refining capacity of each of our refineries as
of December 31, 2009.

Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking, catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of
crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt.
Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, cumene, propane, propylene, sulfur and maleic anhydride.

Our Garyville, Louisiana,
refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. The Garyville refinery predominantly processes heavy sour crude oil into products







such as gasoline, distillates, sulfur, asphalt, propane, polymer grade propylene, isobutane and coke. Our Garyville refinery has earned designation as a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR site.

The Garyville Major Expansion project, completed on
schedule during the fourth quarter of 2009, is currently being fully integrated into the base Garyville refinery. As a result of the expansion, the refinery’s crude oil refining capacity has grown from 256 mbpd to 436 mbpd, making it among the
largest crude oil refineries in the country. The expansion also improves scale efficiencies, feedstock flexibility and refined product yields. The expansion project cost approximately $3.9 billion (excluding capitalized interest).

Our Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery is located in northeastern Kentucky on the western bank of the Big Sandy River, near the confluence
with the Ohio River. The Catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, asphalt, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, propane, propylene and sulfur.

Our Robinson, Illinois, refinery is located in southeastern Illinois. The Robinson refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into
products such as multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, propane, propylene, sulfur and anode-grade coke. The Robinson refinery has earned designation as an OSHA VPP STAR site.

Our Detroit, Michigan, refinery is located near Interstate 75 in southwest Detroit. It is the only petroleum refinery currently operating in
Michigan. The Detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian crude oils, into products such as gasoline, diesel, asphalt, slurry, propane, chemical grade propylene and sulfur. In 2007, we approved a heavy oil
upgrading and expansion project at this refinery, with a current projected cost of $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). This project will enable the refinery to process an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian
bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 10 percent. Construction began in the first half of 2008 and is presently expected to be complete in the second half of 2012. Our Detroit refinery is certified as a Michigan
VPP site, receiving Rising Star status, and expects to satisfy the requirements for STAR status in the first quarter of 2010.

Our Canton, Ohio, refinery is located approximately 60 miles southeast of Cleveland, Ohio. The Canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel fuels, kerosene, propane, sulfur, asphalt, roofing
flux, home heating oil and No. 6 industrial fuel oil.

Our Texas City, Texas, refinery is located on the Texas gulf coast
approximately 30 miles south of Houston, Texas. The refinery processes sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline, propane, chemical grade propylene, slurry, sulfur and aromatics.

Our St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery is located in southeastern Minnesota where it is one of only two refineries in the state. The St.
Paul Park refinery processes predominantly Canadian crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, kerosene, asphalt, propane, propylene and sulfur. Our St. Paul Park refinery is certified as a Minnesota VPP site, receiving Rising Star
status, and expects to satisfy the requirements for STAR status in 2010.

The above discussion includes forward-looking
statements concerning the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Some factors that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions,
delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.

Our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of crude oil,
feedstocks and intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing capacity efficiently.

Planned maintenance activities, or turnarounds, requiring temporary shutdown of certain refinery operating units, are periodically performed at each refinery. In recent years, planned turnarounds have
occurred at two or three refineries per year.

Crude oil supply –We obtain most of the crude oil we refine
through negotiated contracts and purchases or exchanges on the spot market. Our crude oil supply contracts are generally term contracts with market related pricing provisions. The following table provides information on our sources of crude oil for
each of the last three years. The crude oil sourced outside of North America was acquired from various foreign national oil companies, producing companies and trading companies. Of the U.S. and Canadian sourced crude processed at our refineries, 33
mbpd, or four percent, was supplied by a combination of our E&P and OSM production operations for the year 2009.

Refined products marketing and distribution –We are a supplier of refined products to resellers and consumers within our
24-state market area in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. Our market area includes approximately 4,600 Marathon branded-retail outlets concentrated in the Midwest and southeastern states. We
currently own and distribute from 64 light product and 22 asphalt terminals. In addition, we distribute through 60 third-party terminals in our market area. Our marine transportation operations include 16 towboats, as well as 183 owned and 8 leased
barges that transport refined products on the Ohio, Mississippi and Illinois rivers and their tributaries as well as the Intercoastal Waterway. We lease or own approximately 2,400 railcars of various sizes and capacities for movement and storage of
refined products. In addition, we own over 120 transport trucks for the movement of light products.

The following table sets
forth, as a percentage of total refined product sales, sales of refined products to our different customer types for the past three years.

We sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils (including kerosene, jet fuel and diesel fuel) to wholesale marketing customers in the Midwest, upper Great Plains, Gulf
Coast and southeastern regions of the United States. We sold 51 percent of our gasoline volumes and 87 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2009. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in many of our markets, with
demand typically being at its highest levels during the summer months.

We have blended ethanol into gasoline for over 20
years and began expanding our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline were 60 mbpd in 2009, 54 mbpd in 2008 and 40 mbpd in
2007. The future expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. We sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our
marketing territory, including: Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and Hartford, Illinois. We also sell biodiesel-blended diesel in Minnesota, Illinois and Kentucky.

We produce propane at all seven of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock within the
petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers.

We are a producer and marketer of petrochemicals and specialty products. Product availability varies by refinery and includes benzene,
cumene, dilute naphthalene oil, molten maleic anhydride, molten sulfur, propylene, toluene and xylene. We market propylene, cumene and sulfur domestically to customers in the chemical industry. We sell maleic anhydride throughout the United States
and Canada. We also have the capacity to produce 1,400 tons per day of anode grade coke at our Robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry, and 5,500 tons per day of fuel grade coke at the Garyville
refinery, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous industrial applications. In early 2009, we discontinued production and sales of petroleum pitch and aliphatic solvents at our Catlettsburg refinery.

We produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all seven of our refineries. Another product of crude oil, heavy
residual fuel oil, is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product.

We have refinery based asphalt production capacity of up to 108 mbpd. We market asphalt through 33 owned or leased terminals throughout the Midwest and Southeast. We have a broad customer base, including
approximately 675 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We sell asphalt in the wholesale and cargo markets via rail and barge. We also produce asphalt
cements, polymer modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts.

In 2007, we acquired a 35 percent
interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Clymers, Indiana. We also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in
Greenville, Ohio. The Greenville plant began production in February 2008. Both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner.







Pipeline transportation –We own a system of pipelines through Marathon Pipe
Line LLC (“MPL”) and Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (“ORPL”), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions to our refineries, our terminals
and other pipeline systems. Our MPL and ORPL wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1,737 miles of crude oil lines and 1,825 miles of refined product lines comprising 32 systems located in 11 states. The MPL common
carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the United States, based on total barrels delivered. Our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations and
guidelines, including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products. Third parties generated 13 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our MPL and ORPL common carrier pipelines in 2009. Our MPL and
ORPL common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years.

We also own 196 miles of private crude oil pipelines and 850 miles of private refined products pipelines, and we lease 217 miles of common carrier refined product pipelines. We have partial ownership
interests in several pipeline companies that have approximately 780 miles of crude oil pipelines and 3,600 miles of refined products pipelines, including about 970 miles operated by MPL. In addition, MPL operates most of our private pipelines and
985 miles of crude oil and 160 miles of natural gas pipelines owned by our E&P segment.

Our major refined product
pipelines include the owned and operated Cardinal Products Pipeline and the Wabash Pipeline. The Cardinal Products Pipeline delivers refined products from Kenova, West Virginia, to Columbus, Ohio. The Wabash Pipeline system delivers product from
Robinson, Illinois, to various terminals in the area of Chicago, Illinois. Other significant refined product pipelines owned and operated by MPL extend from: Robinson, Illinois, to Louisville, Kentucky; Garyville, Louisiana, to Zachary, Louisiana;
and Texas City, Texas, to Pasadena, Texas.

In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we had interests in the following
refined product pipelines:



•65 percent undivided ownership interest in the Louisville-Lexington system, a petroleum products pipeline system extending from Louisville to
Lexington, Kentucky;



•60 percent interest in Muskegon Pipeline LLC, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from Griffith, Indiana, to North Muskegon, Michigan;



•50 percent interest in Centennial Pipeline LLC, which owns a refined products system connecting the Gulf Coast region with the Midwest market;



•17 percent interest in Explorer Pipeline Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest; and



•6 percent interest in Wolverine Pipe Line Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from Chicago, Illinois, to Toledo, Ohio.

Our major owned and operated crude oil lines run from: Patoka, Illinois, to Catlettsburg, Kentucky; Patoka,
Illinois, to Robinson, Illinois; Patoka, Illinois, to Lima, Ohio; Lima, Ohio to Canton, Ohio; Samaria, Michigan, to Detroit, Michigan; and St. James, Louisiana, to Garyville, Louisiana.

As of December 31, 2009, we had interests in the following crude oil pipelines:



•51 percent interest in LOOP LLC, the owner and operator of LOOP, which is the only U.S. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of
Louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at Clovelly, Louisiana;



•59 percent interest in LOCAP LLC, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting LOOP and the Capline system;







•33 percent undivided joint interest in the Capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from St. James, Louisiana, to Patoka,
Illinois;



•26 percent undivided joint interest in the Maumee Pipeline System, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from Lima, Ohio, to Samaria, Michigan;
and



•17 percent interest in Minnesota Pipe Line Company, LLC, which owns crude oil pipelines extending from Clearbrook, Minnesota, to Cottage Grove,
Minnesota, which is in the vicinity of our St. Paul Park, Minnesota refinery.

We plan to construct, by the
year 2012, a new section of pipeline connecting with the existing crude line from Samaria, Michigan, to Detroit, Michigan. This new section will deliver additional supplies of Canadian crude to our Detroit refinery.

The above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the construction of a new section of pipeline in Michigan. Some factors
that could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by government or third-party approvals and other risks
customarily associated with construction projects.

Retail Marketing

SSA, our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Enon, Ohio, sells gasoline and merchandise through owned and operated
retail outlets primarily under the Speedway®and SuperAmerica®brands. Diesel fuel is also sold at a number of these outlets. SSA retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods,
beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. For eight consecutive quarters, SSA has been rated as the best convenience store chain in terms of overall customer satisfaction in a national consumer perception
survey conducted by Corporate Research International®. In 2009, Harris Interactive’s EquiTrend®annual brand equity study named Speedway®the number one gasoline brand with consumers. SSA’s Speedy Rewards™, an industry-leading customer loyalty program, has built active membership to
3.2 million customers.

As of December 31, 2009, SSA had 1,603 retail outlets in nine states. Sales of refined
products through these retail outlets accounted for 15 percent of our refined product sales volumes in 2009 and provide us with a base of ratable sales. Revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $3,109
million in 2009, $2,838 million in 2008 and $2,796 million in 2007. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in a majority of SSA markets, with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season. Margins from the sale of merchandise
and services tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel.

Competition and Market Conditions

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and
development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these companies for the
equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. Acquiring the more
attractive exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments or commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other
specialists. Based upon statistics compiled in the “2009 Global Upstream Performance Review” published by IHS Herold Inc., we rank eighth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2008 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural
gas production.

We also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic
crude oil to refineries primarily in North America. There are several additional synthetic crude oil projects being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the
supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. Since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of
the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.

We must also compete with a large number of
other companies to acquire crude oil for refinery processing and in the distribution and marketing of a full array of petroleum products. Based upon the “The Oil & Gas Journal







2010 Worldwide Refinery Survey”, we rank fifth among U.S. petroleum companies on the basis of U.S. crude oil refining capacity as of December 31, 2009. We compete in four distinct
markets for the sale of refined products – wholesale, spot, branded and retail distribution. We believe we compete with about 64 companies in the sale of refined products to wholesale marketing customers, including private-brand marketers and
large commercial and industrial consumers; about 75 companies in the sale of refined products in the spot market; ten refiners or marketers in the supply of refined products to refiner branded jobbers and dealers; and approximately 290 retailers in
the retail sale of refined products. (A jobber is a business that does not carry out refining operations but supplies refiner-branded products to gasoline stations or convenience stores. Dealers refer to retail service station or convenience store
operators affiliated with a brand identity.) We compete in the convenience store industry through SSA’s retail outlets. The retail outlets offer consumers gasoline, diesel fuel (at selected locations) and a broad mix of other merchandise and
services. Several nontraditional fuel retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry and the National Petroleum News estimates such retailers had 11 percent of the U.S. gasoline market
in 2009.

Our operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and
petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from production and oil sands mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin
may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political
events and new and changing governmental regulations.

Environmental Matters

The Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental
matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Crisis Management Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or
other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties.

State, national and international legislation to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions are being proposed and, in some cases, promulgated. This legislation applies or could apply in countries in which we operate. Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our
operations. The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we
estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies
through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.

For a discussion of environmental capital
expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial







Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.

Air

The EPA is reviewing and is proposing to revise, all NAAQS for criteria air pollutants. The EPA promulgated a revised ozone standard in
March 2008, and commenced the multi-year process to develop the implementing rules required by the Clean Air Act. On September 16, 2009, the EPA announced that they would reconsider the level of the ozone standard. By court order a final rule
is to be signed by August 31, 2010. Also, on July 15, 2009, the EPA proposed a new short-term nitrogen dioxide standard. The final standard was issued January 22, 2010. In addition, on December 8, 2009, the EPA proposed a new
short term standard for sulfur dioxide. This final standard is to be issued no later than June 2, 2010. We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these revised NAAQS standard until the implementing rules are established and
judicial challenges over the revised NAAQS standards are resolved.

Water

We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have
implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to
respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes criminal sanctions for
violations of its provisions.

Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in U.S. waters be
double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. All of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined products meet the
double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions,
including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90, and we have established Spill
Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (“SPCC”) plans for facilities subject to CWA SPCC requirements.

Solid Waste

We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. The Resource Conservation and
Recovery Act (“RCRA”) establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the
recycling of wastes and the regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”)







containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at one of our RM&T facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal
facilities. In 2010, Canada will implement a ban on the land application of certain wastes. However, the ongoing waste handling and disposal-related costs associated with the Canadian land disposal restrictions are not material because we have
identified alternative hazardous waste treatment options within the United States.

Remediation

We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred.
Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer
their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be
recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings –
Environmental Proceedings – Other Proceedings for a discussion of these sites.

The AOSP operations use established
processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. The AOSP
is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of its on going reclamation work. The reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order
to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. The AOSP continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies. In February 2009, the Alberta Energy Resources
Conservation Board (“ERCB”) issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. In September 2009, the AOSP Joint Venture Operator submitted a tailings management paper to the ERCB, that sets forth
its plan to comply with the Directive. This plan is currently under review by the ERCB. Increased compliance costs may result if tailing pond reclamation technologies prove unsuccessful or less effective than anticipated.

Other Matters

The USX Separation

On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31, 2001, Marathon completed the USX
Separation, in which:



•its wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a separate,
publicly traded company; and



•USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.







As a result of the USX Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies
and neither has any ownership interest in the other.

In connection with the USX Separation and pursuant to the Plan of
Reorganization, Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the USX Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from
periods before the USX Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements.

Financial Matters
Agreement

Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of our
principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us:



•obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities
ranging from 2011 through 2033;



•sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works facility, with a lease term to 2012,
subject to extensions;



•obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed by
United States Steel; and



•certain other guarantees.

The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before the tenth anniversary of the USX Separation, United States Steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of
the assumed industrial revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding
on, and any premium required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds.

Under the financial
matters agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States
Steel has no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases.

The financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all covenants and other
obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations.

United
States Steel’s obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement
does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without our consent.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We are
exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including
the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. While no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, we have exposures to United States Steel arising from the transaction discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated
financial statements.

Trademarks, Patents and Licenses

We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard
any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.







Employees

We had 28,855 active employees as of December 31, 2009. Of that number, 18,325 were employees of SSA, most of who were employed at our retail marketing outlets.

Certain hourly employees at our Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber,
Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers Union under labor agreements that expire on January 31, 2012. Certain employees at our Texas City refinery are represented by the same union under a labor agreement that expires on
March 31, 2012. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly employees under labor agreements that are scheduled to expire on May 31, 2012 at our St. Paul Park refinery and January 31, 2011, at our Detroit
refinery.
