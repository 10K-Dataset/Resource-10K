Items 1. and 2. Business and Properties

General

Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE: MRO) is an independent exploration and production company incorporated in 2001, focused on U.S. resource plays: the Eagle Ford in Texas, the Bakken in North Dakota, STACK and SCOOP in Oklahoma and Northern Delaware in New Mexico. We also have international operations in E.G. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600. Each of our two reportable operating segments are organized by geographic location and managed according to the nature of the products and services offered. The two segments are:

•United States – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in the United States;

•International – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of the United States as well as produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.

Our strategy is to deliver competitive and improving corporate level returns by focusing our capital investment in the lower cost, higher margin U.S. resource plays while maintaining a strong balance sheet, prioritizing sustainable cash flow generation over a wide range of commodity prices, and returning capital to shareholders. SeeItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, for a more detailed discussion of our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.

Our portfolio is concentrated in our core operations in the U.S. resource plays and E.G. The map below shows the locations of our U.S. operations:










Segment Information

In the following discussion regarding our United States and International segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.

United States Segment

We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the U.S. Our primary focus in the United States segment is concentrated within our four high-quality resource plays. SeeItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsfor further detail on current year results.

United States – U.S. Resource Plays

Eagle Ford– We have been operating in the South Texas Eagle Ford play since 2011, where our acreage is located in the high-return Karnes, Atascosa, Gonzales and Lavaca Counties. Our focus is capital efficient development with a goal of maximizing returns and cash flow generation while extending our core acreage. During 2019, we acquired 18,000 net acres adjacent to our existing acreage in the Eagle Ford, which included production of approximately 7,000 net boed and associated midstream infrastructure. Additionally, we operate 32 central gathering and treating facilities across the play that support more than 1,600 producing wells as well as own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes and Atascosa Counties.

Bakken– We have been operating in the Williston Basin since 2006. The majority of our core acreage is within McKenzie, Mountrail, and Dunn Counties in North Dakota targeting the Middle Bakken and Three Forks reservoirs. We continue focusing our investment in our high-return Myrmidon and Hector areas, while also delineating and extending our core acreage across the rest of our position.

Oklahoma– With a history in Oklahoma that dates back more than 100 years, our primary focus has recently been early infill development in the STACK Meramec and SCOOP Woodford, while progressing delineation of other plays across our footprint. We primarily hold net acreage with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage and other prospect intervals, with a majority of this in the SCOOP and STACK, with our recent activity in these plays being directed towards the more advantaged overpressured oil areas.

Northern Delaware– We have been operating in the Northern Delaware basin, which is located within the greater Permian area, since closing on two major acquisitions in 2017. Our focus has been to strategically advance our position and prepare for future development by further coring up our footprint, progressing early delineation of our acreage, improving our cost structure and securing midstream solutions.  We have the majority of our acreage in Eddy and Lea counties primarily in the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring New Mexico plays.

United States – Resource Exploration

Our resource exploration properties in the United States include our acquired acreage in the emerging Louisiana Austin Chalk play, with an acreage position focused in the Western Fairway.  Our first exploration well is on flowback and well clean-up and we have recently spud on our second exploration well. We also closed on approximately40,000net acres in the Texas Delaware oil play in West Texas for$106 millionin 2019.

International Segment

We are engaged in oil and gas development and production activities in E.G. We include the results of our investments in the LPG processing plant, gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International segment.

International

Equatorial Guinea– We own a63%operated working interest under a production sharing contract in the Alba field and an80%operated working interest in Block D, both of which are offshore E.G. Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately97%in2019.

Equatorial Guinea – Gas Processing–We own a52%interest in Alba Plant LLC, accounted for as an equity method investment, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island. Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant under a fixed-price long term contract. The LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations.








We also own60%of EGHoldings and45%of AMPCO, both accounted for as equity method investments. EGHoldings operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island. These facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field. The LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta sales and purchase agreement. Under the current agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled approximately3mmta in2019. AMPCO had gross sales totaling approximately878mt in2019. Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S.

During 2019, we executed agreements for third-party gas through existing E.G. infrastructure, the initial step in creating an E.G. gas hub. Natural gas from the Alen field will be processed through the existing Alba Plant LLC LPG processing plant and  the EGHoldings LNG production facility. First gas sales are expected in early 2021.

United Kingdom–In the third quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our U.K. business, which represents a complete country exit. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –Note 5to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

Other International

Kurdistan Region of Iraq– In the second quarter of 2019, we closed on the sale of our 15% non-operated interest in the Atrush block in Kurdistan which represents a complete country exit. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –Note 5to the consolidated financial statements for further detail.

Reserves

Proved reserves are required to be disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves. A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent. For additional detail on reserves, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.

Acreage

We believe we have satisfactory title to our United States and International properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation. In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry. In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international production sharing contracts or exploration licenses.

The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held as ofDecember 31, 2019.

In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future. If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, undeveloped acreage listed in the table below could expire over the next three years.  We plan to continue the terms of certain of these leases through operational or administrative actions.  There are no material quantities of net proved undeveloped reserves assigned to expiring undeveloped acreage in the next three years.

(d)Production, severance and property taxes are excluded; however, shipping and handling as well as other operating expenses are included in the production costs used in this calculation. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities- Results of Operations for Oil and Gas Production Activities for more information regarding production costs.



Marketing

Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas. These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production. We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points. Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale.








Major Customers

We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In2019,sales to Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Flint Hills Resources, Valero Marketing and Supply, and Shell Trading and each of their respective affiliates, accounted for approximately13%,13%,11%and10%of our total revenues. In2018, sales to Valero Marketing and Supply and Flint Hills Resources and their respective affiliates, each accounted for approximately11%of our total revenues. In2017, sales to Vitol and their respective affiliates accounted for approximately10%of our total revenues.

Gross Delivery Commitments

We have committed to deliver gross quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas to customers under a variety of contracts. As ofDecember 31, 2019, the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following commitments:

All of these contracts provide the option of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate to satisfy our commitment. In addition to the contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production. Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms.

Competition

Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and we compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, national oil companies, and to a lesser extent, companies that supply alternative sources of energy. We compete, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves, acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties, the marketing and delivery of our production into worldwide commodity markets and for the labor and equipment required for exploration and development of those properties. Principal methods of competing include geological, geophysical, and engineering research and technology, experience and expertise, economic analysis in connection with portfolio management, and safely operating oil and gas producing properties. SeeItem 1A. Risk Factorsfor discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters

The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties.

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution or recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil and produced water, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal. In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners








or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations.

New laws have been enacted or are otherwise being considered and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, seeItem 3. Legal ProceedingsandItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.

Air and Climate Change

Environmental advocacy groups and regulatory agencies in the United States and other countries have focused considerable attention on the emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases and their role in climate change. Developments in greenhouse gas initiatives may affect us and other similarly situated companies operating in the oil and gas industry. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship and as required by law, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.

Government entities and other groups have filed lawsuits in several states and other jurisdictions seeking to hold a wide variety of companies that produce fossil fuels liable for the alleged impacts of the greenhouse gas emissions attributable to those fuels. The lawsuits allege damages as a result of global warming and the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages and abatement under various tort theories. Marathon Oil has been named as a defendant in several of these lawsuits, along with numerous other companies. Similar lawsuits may be filed in other jurisdictions. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that the claims made against us are without merit and will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

The EPA finalized a more stringent NAAQS for ozone in October 2015. States that contain any areas designated as non-attainment, and any tribes that choose to do so, will be required to complete development of implementation plans in the 2020-2022 time frame. The EPA may in the future designate additional areas as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate. The EPA is also in the process of reviewing the ozone NAAQS to determine whether to maintain the 2015 standard or to promulgate a more stringent standard.  This review is expected to be complete by December 2020. The implementation of the 2015 standard, or the promulgation of a future more stringent standard, may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia largely upheld EPA’s 2015 standard in August 2019.  No party has sought review of this decision and, therefore, it is final.

In November 2016, the BLM issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements. BLM issued a two-year stay of these requirements in December 2017. In September 2018, BLM published a final rule to rescind substantial portions of the rule. The rescission was challenged by multiple parties in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. If the judicial challenges to the rule are successful and the rule were to come back into effect, the requirements would result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.

Hydraulic Fracturing

Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations. Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing. Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with these initiatives, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented.








Water

In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the federal CWA and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule was stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits. In October 2019, EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule that repealed the 2015 regulations and reinstated the agencies’ narrower pre-2015 scope of federal CWA jurisdiction. In January 2020, EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers promulgated a new WOTUS definition that continues to provide a narrower scope of federal CWA jurisdiction than contemplated under the 2015 WOTUS definition, while also providing for greater predictability and consistency of federal CWA jurisdiction. Judicial challenges to EPA’s October 2019 final rule are currently before multiple federal district courts and challenges to EPA’s January 2020 final rule are anticipated. If the October 2019 final rule is vacated and the 2015 rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.

For additional information, seeItem 1A. Risk Factors.
