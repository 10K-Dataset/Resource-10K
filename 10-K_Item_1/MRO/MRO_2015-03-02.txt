General

Marathon Oil Corporation is a global energy company based in Houston, Texas, with operations in North America, Europe and Africa. Our corporate headquarters are located at 5555 San Felipe Street, Houston, Texas 77056-2723 and our telephone number is (713) 629-6600.  Each of our three reportable operating segments is organized based upon both geographic location and the nature of the products and services it offers.

•North America E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas in North America;

•International E&P – explores for, produces and markets crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas outside of North America and produces and markets products manufactured from natural gas, such as LNG and methanol, in E.G.; and

•Oil Sands Mining – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and market synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil.

We were incorporated in 2001. On June 30, 2011, we completed the spin-off of our downstream business, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Oil and MPC.

Strategy and Results Summary

We have production operations in the U.S., E.G., Canada, the U.K. and Libya.  The focus of our U.S. operations is our three core unconventional resource plays:  the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins.  Our exploration prospects are in E.G., Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq and the U.S, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico.  Our strategy is guided by the following seven strategic imperatives ("SI7"):

1.Living Our Values

2.Investing in Our People

3.Continuous Improvement in Operational and Capital Efficiency

4.Driving Profitable and Sustainable Growth

5.Rigorous Portfolio Management

6.Quality and Material Resource Capture

7.Delivering Long-Term Shareholder Value

In 2014, we continued to focus on liquid hydrocarbon reserves, realizing substantial increases in our three unconventional resource plays, the Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins.  In 2014, our U.S. operations added 288 mmboe proved reserves, excluding acquisitions, dispositions and production, amounting to an increase of 37 percent over the prior year's ending balance.

For the total company, we ended2014with proved reserves of approximately2,198mmboe, compared to2,171mmboe at the end of2013.  Excluding proved reserves of 106 mmboe related to our Angola and Norway discontinued operations, proved reserves related to continuing operations increased from2,065mmboe at the end of2013to2,198mmboe at the end of2014for an increase of 6 percent.

We continually evaluate ways to optimize our portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures. In 2014, we executed two strategic dispositions for aggregate cash proceeds of more than $4 billion.  We closed the sale of our Angola assets in the first quarter and our Norway business in the fourth quarter.

During 2014, we repurchased approximately 29 million shares for $1 billion.  Our cash additions to property, plant and equipment related to continuing operations were$5.2 billion, primarily funded with cash flow from operations, with more than 70 percent of that related to our Eagle Ford, Bakken and Oklahoma Resource Basins where net sales volumes increased 35 percent year-over-year.

Segment and Geographic Information

For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note7to the consolidated financial statements.

In the following discussion regarding our North America E&P, International E&P and Oil Sands Mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.

North America E&P Segment

We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in the U.S. and Canada.

Unconventional Resource Plays

Eagle Ford- As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had approximately 180,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford in south Texas and 954 gross (714 net) operated producing wells, where we have been operating since 2011.  During2014, we reached total depth on 360 gross operated wells and brought 310 gross operated wells to sales, compared to 299 reaching total depth and 307 brought to sales in2013.  Included with the Eagle Ford well counts noted above, were 22 gross operated Austin Chalk wells brought online in 2014 and the first four Upper Eagle Ford wells which were brought online late in the fourth quarter of 2014.  Our2014average spud-to-TD time was 13 days compared to 12 days in2013.  Our high-density pad drilling continues to average approximately four wells per pad in2014.  This higher pad density and the longer laterals being drilled in2014contribute to the slightly higher spud-to-TD time in2014.

Throughout 2013, we evaluated the potential of downspacing to 40-acre and 60-acre spacing with several pilot programs.  Wells drilled in these programs at closer spacing showed improved completion efficiency which helped offset impacts due to tighter well spacing.  The continued focus on stimulation design has contributed to incremental improvements in well performance across our area of activity.

Eagle Ford net sales in2014were112mboed,65 percentcrude oil and condensate, 17 percent NGLs and 18 percent natural gas, compared to81mboed in2013, a38 percentincrease.  In2014, we transported approximately 70 percent of our










Eagle Ford production by pipeline and anticipate this to increase to 90 percent in 2015 as additional pipeline capacity is constructed and completed.  The ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint.

During 2014, we continued evaluation of the Austin Chalk formation across our Eagle Ford acreage position in south Texas, delineating 18,000 initial Austin Chalk acres and bringing online 22 wells.  Initial Austin Chalk production results indicate that the mix of crude oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas is similar to Eagle Ford condensate wells.  We plan to drill 56 to 62 additional gross wells in the Austin Chalk formation in2015.  Co-development of the Austin Chalk and Lower Eagle Ford will leverage the infrastructure investments we have made to support production growth across the Eagle Ford operating area.  During the fourth quarter of 2014, the first four Upper Eagle Ford wells were brought online and we spud our first four-well pilot with Austin Chalk, Upper Eagle Ford, and two Lower Eagle Ford wells.

We operate approximately 800 miles of gathering pipeline in the Eagle Ford area.  We now have 31 central gathering and treating facilities, with aggregate capacity of more than 460 mboed. We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 37-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes, Atascosa, and Bee Counties of south Texas.

Approximately 40 percent of our2015Budget, $1.4 billion, is allocated to the Eagle Ford.  Our drilling plans for2015include drilling 141 - 152 net wells  (245 - 260 gross, of which we will operate 215 - 225), a decrease of approximately 40 percent over 2014.  We anticipate bringing 255 - 275 gross operated wells to sales during 2015.

Bakken– We hold approximately 290,000 net acres in the Bakken shale oil play in North Dakota and eastern Montana, where we have been operating since 2006.  Since inception, we have continuously sought improvement in efficiency and well performance through optimizing completion techniques.  We began high-density spacing pilots in 2014, with each pad comprised of six Middle Bakken formation and six Three Forks first bench formation wells per drilling-spacing unit.  We continue to execute an enhanced completion design pilot program, including elevated proppant volumes, hybrid slickwater fracs, increased stages and cemented liners, with 42 of the 55 tests online at the end of 2014.

Our time to drill a well averaged 17 days spud-to-TD in2014compared to 15 days in2013.  We reached TD on 83 gross operated wells and brought to sales 67 gross operated wells in2014compared to 76 reaching total depth and 77 brought to sales in2013.  We recompleted 35 wells during 2014.

Our net sales from the Bakken shale averaged51mboed in2014, approximately 88 percent crude oil, 6 percent NGLs and 6 percent natural gas, compared to39mboed in2013, a31 percentincrease.  In efforts to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local North Dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside the state.

Approximately 20 percent of our2015Budget, $760 million, is allocated to the Bakken.  Our 2015 Bakken program includes plans to drill 42 - 53 net wells (100 - 120 gross, of which we will operate 38 - 48). We anticipate bringing 68 - 78 gross operated wells to sales during 2015.

Oklahoma Resource Basins– Our primary focus in 2015 will be in the SCOOP and STACK areas.  In the SCOOP area we hold approximately 145,000 net acres with rights to the unconventional Woodford, Springer, Granite Wash and other Pennsylvanian sands plays.  We also hold approximately 100,000 net acres in the STACK area with rights to the unconventional Woodford, Meramec and other Mississippian plays.  These totals include over 50,000 acres added in the SCOOP and STACK areas in 2014.  Though not a focus of the 2015 program, we also hold 57,000 net acres in the broader western Oklahoma Granite Wash and other Pennsylvanian sands plays.

In the SCOOP and STACK areas, we reached total depth on 17 gross operated wells and brought 18 gross operated wells to sales in2014compared to 10 reaching total depth and nine brought to sales in2013.  A total of nine net non-operated unconventional wells were brought to sales in2014compared to three in2013.

Sales from our Oklahoma Resource Basins in2014were primarily from the Anadarko Woodford shale and averaged18mboed, approximately 16 percent crude oil, 28 percent NGLs and 56 percent natural gas, compared to14mboed in2013, a29 percentincrease.

Approximately 6 percent of our2015Budget, $226 million, is allocated to the Oklahoma Resource Basins.  Our drilling plans for the Oklahoma Resource Basins in 2015 include drilling and completing 17 - 20 net wells (41 - 50 gross of which 16 - 20 are company operated wells).  We anticipate bringing 18 - 22 gross operated wells to sales during 2015.

See below for discussion of our conventional, primarily natural gas, production operations in Oklahoma.










Other United States

Gulf of Mexico–Production– OnDecember 31, 2014, we held significant interests in 11 producing fields, four of which are company-operated.  Average net sales in2014from the Gulf of Mexico were14mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and16mmcfd of natural gas, or17mboed compared to 19 mboed in2013.  Operational availability for our operated properties was 96 percent, with internal unplanned losses of four percent.

We have a 65 percent operated working interest in the Ewing Bank Block 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana.  The platform serves as a production hub for the Lobster, Oyster and Arnold fields on Ewing Bank Blocks 873, 917 and 963.  The facility also processes third-party production via subsea tie-backs.

We have a 50 percent non-operated working interest in the Petronius field on Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830, located 130 miles southeast of New Orleans, which includes 15 producing wells.  The Petronius platform is also capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields.

We hold a 30 percent non-operated working interest in the Neptune field located on Atwater Valley Block 575, 120 miles south off the coast of Louisiana.  The development includes seven subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform.  A new Neptune sidetrack well came online late December 2014.

We have an 18 percent non-operated working interest in the Gunflint field development located on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 948, 949, 992(N/2) and 993(N/2), 90 miles south off the coast of Louisiana.  The discovery well was drilled in 2008 and encountered pay in the Middle Miocene reservoirs. Two subsequent appraisal wells were drilled and evaluated in 2012 and 2013. The subsea tie-back development project will continue to progress in 2015, with first oil expected in 2016.

Gulf of Mexico – Exploration–We have a 3-year shared contract on the Maersk Valiant drillship and plan to utilize the rig to test prospects in the Gulf of Mexico, including one operated exploration well in 2015.  As we evaluate various opportunities for drilling, we may seek partners to further reduce our exploration risk on individual projects.

A deepwater oil discovery on the Shenandoah prospect, located on Walker Ridge Block 52, was drilled in 2009.  We own a 10 percent non-operated working interest in this prospect.  The first appraisal well on the Shenandoah prospect reached total depth in 2013 and was successful.  The second appraisal well was spud in late May 2014 and the well costs incurred through December 31, 2014 were expensed in the fourth quarter of 2014.  A third appraisal well is anticipated to spud on Walker Ridge Block 51 in 2015.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we drilled two exploratory wells in the Gulf of Mexico: one on the Key Largo prospect, located on Walker Ridge Block 578, in which we have a 60 percent working interest and one on the Perseus prospect, located on Desoto Canyon Block, in which we have a 30 percent non-operated working interest.  Neither well encountered commercial hydrocarbons and the well costs incurred through December 31, 2014 were charged to dry well expense.  We have no further plans to explore either prospect.

Oklahoma– We have long-established operated and non-operated conventional production in several Oklahoma fields from which sales averaged 8 mboed in 2014 and 9 mboed in2013.

Texas/North Louisiana/New Mexico– We hold approximately 242,000 net acres in these areas of which approximately 20,000 of the acres are in the Haynesville and Bossier natural gas shale plays.  Most of the acreage in these shale plays is held by production.  We participated in one gross non-operated well in the Haynesville shale play during2014.  Conventional production was primarily from the Mimms Creek, Pearwood and Haynesville fields in2014, with net sales averaging 5 mboed in both 2014 and 2013.  We also participate in several non-operated Permian Basin fields in west Texas and New Mexico.  Net sales from this area averaged 7 mboed in2014.

Wyoming –We have ongoing enhanced oil recovery waterflood projects at the mature Bighorn Basin and Wind River Basin fields and at our 100 percent owned and operated Pitchfork field.  We have conventional natural gas operations in the Greater Green River Basin.  Operated production at the Powder River Basin field ceased in March 2014, and plug and abandonment activities were substantially complete as of December 31, 2014.

Our Wyoming net sales averaged16mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and11mmcfd of natural gas, or18mboed, during2014compared to 22 mboed in2013.  We drilled 11 gross operated development wells in Wyoming in2014.   In addition, we own and operate the 420-mile Red Butte Pipeline.  This crude oil pipeline connects Silvertip Station on the Montana/Wyoming state line to Casper, Wyoming.










Canada

We hold interests in both operated and non-operated exploration stage oil sand leases in Alberta, Canada, which would be developed using in-situ methods of extraction.  These leases cover approximately142,000gross (54,000net) acres in four project areas: Namur, in which we hold a 70 percent operated interest; Birchwood, in which we hold a 100 percent operated interest; Ells River, in which we hold a 20 percent non-operated interest; and Saleski in which we hold a 33 percent non-operated interest.

During 2012, we submitted a regulatory application relating to our Canada in-situ assets at Birchwood, for a proposed 12 mbbld steam assisted gravity drainage ("SAGD") demonstration project.  We expect to receive regulatory approval for this project by the end of 2015.  Upon receiving this approval, we will further evaluate our development plans.

North America E&P--Acquisitions

In an asset acquisition that closed August 2014, we added acreage to our Oklahoma Resource Basins at a cost of approximately $80 million before final settlement adjustments.

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we acquired additional acreage in the SCOOP, at a cost of approximately $60 million before final settlement adjustments.

International E&P Segment

We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and/or production activities in E.G., Ethiopia, Gabon, Kenya, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Libya and the U.K.  We include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International E&P segment.

Africa

Equatorial Guinea–Production– We own a 63 percent operated working interest under a PSC in the Alba field which is offshore E.G.  During2014, E.G. net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged31mbbld and net natural gas sales averaged439mmcfd, or104mboed, compared to107mboed in2013.  Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 98 percent in2014, with internal unplanned losses of one percent.  A compression project designed to maintain the production plateau two additional years and extend field life up to eight years is underway and is expected to be operational in 2016.

Dry natural gas from the Alba field, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed by Alba Plant LLC, as discussed below, is supplied to AMPCO and EGHoldings under long-term contracts at fixed prices.  Because of the location and limited local demand for natural gas in E.G., we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, EGHoldings and AMPCO  to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances.  Any dry gas not sold is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba field for later production.

Equatorial Guinea–Exploration– We hold a 63 percent operated working interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and an 80 percent operated working interest in the Corona well on Block D.  We plan to develop Block D through a unitization with the Alba field, which is currently being negotiated.  We also have an 80 percent operated working interest in exploratory Block A-12 offshore Bioko Island, located immediately west of our operated Alba Field. The Sodalita West #1 exploratory well was spud during 2014 and reached total depth in February 2015.  This well did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons and well costs incurred through December 31, 2014 were charged to dry well expense in the fourth quarter of 2014.  A second exploratory well and one Alba field infill well are expected to be drilled in 2015.

Equatorial Guinea–Gas Processing –We own a 52 percent interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee, that operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island.  Alba field natural gas is processed by the LPG plant.  Under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, the LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations.  During2014, the gross quantity of natural gas supplied to the LPG production facility was 856 mmcfd, from which 6 mbbld of secondary condensate and 19 mbbld of LPG were produced by Alba Plant LLC.

We also own 60 percent of EGHoldings and 45 percent of AMPCO, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments.  EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island.  These facilities allow us to monetize natural gas reserves from the Alba field.

EGHoldings' 3.7 mmta LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement through 2023.  The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index.  Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 4 mmta in2014.  Operational availability was 98 percent in 2014, including a planned turnaround, while internal unplanned losses were less than one percent.










AMPCO had gross sales totaling 885 mt in2014.  Operational availability for this methanol plant was 90 percent in2014, and internal unplanned losses were ten percent.  Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S.

Libya– We hold a 16 percent non-operated working interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya.  Beginning in the third quarter of 2013, our Libya operations were impacted by third-party labor strikes at the Es Sider oil terminal. In early July 2014, Libya's National Oil Corporation rescinded force majeure associated with the third-party labor strikes, and our concession term was extended for slightly more than one year.  Although we had five liftings during 2014, in December 2014, Libya’s National Oil Corporation once again declared force majeure at Es Sider as disruptions from civil unrest continue.  Considerable uncertainty remains around the timing of future production and sales levels.  We and our partners in the Waha concessions continue to assess the situation and the condition of our assets in Libya.  See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our Libya operations.

Gabon–Exploration– We hold a 21.25 percent non-operated working interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit offshore Gabon, which covers approximately 2.2 million gross (477,000 net) acres.  The Diaman-1B well reached total depth in the third quarter of 2013, encountering 160-180 net feet of hydrocarbon pay in the deepwater pre-salt play.  Analysis confirmed dry gas accumulation with minor condensate.  Multiple additional pre-salt prospects have been identified on this License.  In 2014, 3D seismic acquisition was completed in the western part of the block.

In August 2014, we signed an exploration and production sharing contract for Gabon offshore Block G13, which was subsequently re-named Tchicuate.  The block, which is located in the pre-salt play offshore Gabon, encompasses 277,000 acres. The seismic program is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2015, and processing will occur through the remainder of the year.  We hold a 100 percent participating interest and operatorship in the block.  In the event of development, the Republic of Gabon will assume a 20 percent financed interest in the contract upon commencement of production.  The State holds additional rights to participate in the block in the future as a co-investor.

Kenya–Exploration– We hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in Block 9, consisting of approximately 3.9 million gross (1.9 million net) acres in northwest Kenya.  The Sala-1 exploration well was spud in February 2014 on the eastern side of Block 9 and made a natural gas discovery in the second quarter of 2014.  The well was drilled to a total depth of approximately 10,000 feet, and analysis indicated three zones of interest over a 3,280-foot gross interval which were subsequently drill-stem tested.  The Sala-2 appraisal well spud in the third quarter of 2014, but did not encounter commercial hydrocarbons, and the well costs were charged to dry well expense.  We hold a 50 percent non-operated working interest in Block 9 with the option to operate any commercial development.

We also hold a 15 percent non-operated working interest in Block 12A, covering approximately 3.8 million gross (566,000 net) acres, which is also located in northwest Kenya.  The acquisition of 2D seismic on Block 12A began in 2013 and was completed in 2014.  Multiple prospects have been identified and the first exploratory well is anticipated to be drilled in late 2015.

Ethiopia–Exploration– We hold a 20 percent non-operated working interest in the onshore South Omo Block in Ethiopia.  The concession has an area of approximately 5.4 million gross (1.1 million net) acres.  Two wells were drilled on the South Omo Block in 2014:  the Shimela-1 well, which reached total depth in May 2014, and the Gardim-1 well, which reached total depth in July 2014.  Neither well encountered commercial hydrocarbons and the well costs were charged to dry well expense during 2014.

We have a 50 percent non-operated working interest in the Rift Basin Area Block with approximately 10.5 million gross acres.  We began 2D seismic acquisition in the first quarter of 2015 in order to develop prospect inventory for a future drilling program.  We have the option to operate if a discovery is made.

Other– An outbreak of the Ebola virus has existed in certain regions of West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, Sierra Leone) since late 2013.  Although neither E.G. nor any other African country in which we have business activities has been impacted by Ebola to date, our business operations may be adversely affected through travel or other restrictions. We continue to monitor the situation, have enhanced our emergency response plans to address any potential impact, and are working closely with appropriate external parties to maintain business continuity and the health and well-being of our staff.

Other International

United Kingdom– Net sales from the U.K. averaged11mbbld of liquid hydrocarbons and28mmcfd of natural gas, or16mboed, in2014compared to20mboed in2013.  Our largest asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 39 percent working interest in the East Brae field.  The Brae Alpha platform and facilities host the South, Central and West Brae fields.  The North Brae and East Brae fields are natural gas condensate fields which are produced via the Brae Bravo and the East Brae platforms, respectively.  The East Brae platform also hosts the nearby Braemar field in which we have a 28 percent










working interest.  Operational availability in 2014 for the Brae complex was 90 percent and internal unplanned losses were nine percent.  We brought two South Brae infill wells online late in the second half of 2014 and plan to complete two West Brae subsea wells and one additional South Brae infill well in 2015.

The strategic location of the Brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986.  Currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the Brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the Brae infrastructure.  In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage.

The working interest owners of the Brae area producing assets collectively own a 50 percent non-operated interest in the  SAGE system.  The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day.  The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.

We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and a 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields.  The export of Foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an FPSO to market.  All natural gas sales are to the non-operated Magnus platform for use as injection gas.

Croatia– We were awarded, as part of a consortium, seven blocks located offshore in the Adriatic Sea, subject to negotiation of a PSC with the Croatian Government.  We have a 60 percent interest in the consortium.

Kurdistan Region of Iraq– In aggregate, we have approximately109,000net acres in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.  We have a 45 percent operated working interest in the Harir block located northeast of Erbil. For a short time in 2014, we suspended certain operations due to security concerns in the region and continue to closely monitor the situation.  We also have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush with 15 percent working interest and Sarsang with 20 percent working interest.

On the non-operated Atrush block, following the successful appraisal program and a declaration of commerciality, the Kurdistan Ministry of Natural Resources approved a plan for field development in September 2013.  The development project consists of drilling three production wells and constructing a central processing facility in Phase 1 which provides for a 25-year production period.  We expect first production in late 2015 with estimated initial gross production of approximately 30 mbbld of oil.  Subject to further drilling and testing results, and partner and government approvals, a potential Phase 2 development could add an additional gross 30 mbbld facility.  The Atrush-3 appraisal well, within the potential Phase 2 development area approximately four miles east of existing wells, confirmed the extension of the oil bearing reservoirs in 2013 and has been suspended as a potential future producer.

On the non-operated Sarsang block, the Swara Tika discovery was declared commercial in May 2014 and a field development plan was filed in June 2014.  Currently, the East Swara Tika-1 exploration well is being sidetracked up-dip. Discussions are ongoing with the Ministry of Natural Resources to finalize the Swara Tika field development plan.

On the operated Harir block, we spud the Mirawa-2 appraisal well in December 2014 which is expected to reach total depth in the second quarter of 2015.  In December 2014, we announced the Jisik-1 discovery and in 2013, the Mirawa-1 discovery.  Both the Jisik-1 and Mirawa-1 exploratory wells had discovered multiple stacked oil and natural gas producing zones, and have been suspended for potential future use as producing wells.

Acquisitions and Dispositions

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we closed the sale of our Norway business, including the operated Alvheim FPSO, 10 operated licenses and a number of non-operated licenses on the Norwegian Continental Shelf in the North Sea,with an effective date of January 1, 2014 for proceeds of approximately $2.1 billion.

In the first quarter of 2014, we closed the sales of our 10 percent non-operated working interests in the Production Sharing Contracts and Joint Operating Agreements for Angola Blocks 31 and 32 for aggregate proceeds of approximately $2 billion. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these dispositions, including discontinued operations presentation.

Acreage

We believe we have satisfactory title to our North America E&P and International E&P properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation.  In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition.  Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations.  Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry.  In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international PSCs or exploration licenses.

The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held in our North America E&P and International E&P segments combined as ofDecember 31, 2014.

In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future.  If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, licenses, or concessions, undeveloped acreage listed in the table below will expire over the next three years.  We plan to continue the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas or retain leases through operational or administrative actions.

Oil Sands Mining Segment

We hold a 20 percent non-operated interest in the AOSP, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in Alberta, Canada.  The joint venture produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil.

The AOSP’s mining and extraction assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and include the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines.  Gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net to our interest) barrels of bitumen per day. The AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils.  Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques.  The mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles.  The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry.  The slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth.  A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes.  The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently.  The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300-mile Corridor Pipeline.

The AOSP's Scotford upgrader is located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton, Alberta.  The bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products.  Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products.  The upgrader produces synthetic crude oils and vacuum gas oil.  The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long-term contract at market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace.

As ofDecember 31, 2014, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 163,000 gross (33,000 net) acres.  The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta.  Synthetic crude oil sales volumes for2014averaged50mbbld and net-of-royalty production was41mbbld.

In December 2013, a Jackpine mine expansion project received conditional approval from the Canadian government.  The project includes additional mining areas, associated processing facilities and infrastructure.  The government conditions relate to wildlife, the environment and aboriginal health issues.  We will evaluate the potential expansion project and government conditions after infrastructure reliability initiatives are completed.

The governments of Alberta and Canada have agreed to partially fund Quest CCS for $865 million Canadian.  In the third quarter of 2012, the Energy and Resources Conservation Board ("ERCB"), Alberta's primary energy regulator at that time, conditionally approved the project and the AOSP partners approved proceeding to construct and operate Quest CCS.   Government funding commenced in 2012 and continued as milestones were achieved during the development, construction and operating phases.  Failure of the AOSP to meet certain timing, performance and operating objectives may result in repaying some of the government funding.  Construction and commissioning of Quest CCS is expected to be completed by late 2015.










Reserves

Estimated Reserve Quantities

Reserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15 percent or more of our total proved reserves.  A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent, or a continent.  Other International ("Other Int’l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.  We closed the sale of our Angola assets in the first quarter of 2014 and our Norway business in the fourth quarter of 2014, and both are shown as discontinued operations ("Disc Ops") for all periods presented.  Approximately 76 percent of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries.

Our December 31, 2014 proved reserves were calculated using the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in 2014 within the 12-month period.  The 2014 unweighted averages for certain of the benchmark prices were as follows:

•WTI crude oil - $94.99 per bbl

•Henry Hub natural gas - $4.31 per mmbtu

•Brent crude oil - $101.39 per bbl

A sustained period of lower commodity prices could also cause us to decrease our near term capital programs and defer investment until prices improve.  A shifting of capital expenditures into future periods outside of five years from the initial proved reserve booking could potentially lead to a reduction in proved undeveloped reserves.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a further discussion of how a substantial extended decline in commodity prices could impact us.

The most significant increase in total proved reserves from 2013 to 2014 related to our U.S. unconventional shale plays, while sales of reserves in place related to our Norway and Angola discontinued operations were the largest decreases in 2014 proved reserves.  Excluding discontinued operations, total proved reserves related to continuing operations increased 133 mmboe primarily due to drilling programs in our U.S. unconventional shale plays and additions in E.G. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, offset by production.  In the U.S., we added 288 mmboe in 2014, excluding purchases and sales of reserves in place and production, amounting to an increase of 37 percent over the 2013 ending balance, mainly due to downspacing, drilling activity and improved well performance.  The negative 55 mmboe revision to Canadian synthetic crude oil reserves primarily reflects the impact of technical and price changes on calculated royalty volumes as well as development plan changes in the mineable areas. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities for more information.

The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our proved crude oil and condensate, NGL, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the 12-month periods endedDecember 31, 2014,2013and2012.

Preparation of Reserve Estimates

All estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X.  Crude oil and condensate, NGL, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group, which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and his staff of Reserve Coordinators.  Crude oil and condensate, NGL, and natural gas reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators ("QREs").  QREs are engineers or geoscientists who hold at least a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed Marathon Oil's QRE training course.  Our Corporate Reserves group screens all fields with net proved reserves of 20 mmboe or greater, every year, to determine if a field review will be performed.  Any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 1 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by a Reserve Coordinator.

Our Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Vice President, Operations Services, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.  In his 27 years with Marathon Oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including managing our OSM segment.  He is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE") and a former member of the Petroleum Engineering Advisory Council for the University of Texas at Austin.

Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves are prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants ("GLJ") of Calgary, Canada, third-party consultants.  Their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The individual responsible for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves has 14 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta.

Audits of Estimates

Third-party consultants are engaged to provide independent estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period for the purpose of auditing and validating our internal reserve estimates.  We exceeded this percentage for the four-year period endedDecember 31, 2014.  We have established a tolerance level of 10 percent such that initial estimates by the third-party consultants for each field are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates.  Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both parties re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate.  This resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent.  In the very limited instances where differences outside the 10 percent tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and senior management consent is obtained.  The audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for2014,2013or2012.










During2014,2013and2012, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. ("NSAI") prepared a certification of the prior year's reserves for the Alba field in E.G.  The NSAI summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Members of the NSAI team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI.  The senior technical advisor has over 35 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences, with over 15 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves.  The second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering, with 5 years experience in the estimation and evaluation of reserves.  Both are registered  Professional Engineers in the State of Texas.

Ryder Scott Company ("Ryder Scott") also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in2014,2013and2012.  Their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 20 years of industry experience, having worked for a major international oil and gas company before joining Ryder Scott.  He is a member of SPE, where he served on the Oil and Gas Reserves Committee, and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.

Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves

As ofDecember 31, 2014, 728 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, an increase of 101 mmboe fromDecember 31, 2013.  The following table shows changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for2014:

(mmboe)Beginning of year627Revisions of previous estimates1Improved recovery1Purchases of reserves in place4Extensions, discoveries, and other additions227Dispositions(29)Transfers to proved developed(103)End of year728

Significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during2014included 121 mmboe in the Eagle Ford and 61 mmboe in the Bakken shale plays due to development drilling.  Transfers from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves included 67 mmboe in the Eagle Ford, 26 mmboe in the Bakken and 1 mmboe in the Oklahoma Resource Basins due to development drilling and completions. Costs incurred in2014,2013and2012relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were$3,149 million,$2,536 millionand$1,995 million.

A total of 102 mmboe was booked as extensions, discoveries or other additions due to the application of reliable technology.  Technologies included statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis.  The statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved undeveloped locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves.

Projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as large development projects which take more than five years to complete, or the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. Of the 728 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves atDecember 31, 2014, 19 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. The majority of this volume is related to a compression project in E.G. that was sanctioned by our Board of Directors in 2004. The timing of the installation of compression is being driven by the reservoir performance with this project intended to maintain maximum production levels. Performance of this field since the Board sanctioned the project has far exceeded expectations. Estimates of initial dry gas in place increased by roughly 10 percent between 2004 and 2010. During 2012, the compression project received the approval of the E.G. government, allowing design and planning work to progress towards implementation, with completion expected by mid-2016. The other component of Alba proved undeveloped reserves is an infill well approved in 2013 and to be drilled in the second quarter of 2015.

Proved undeveloped reserves for the North Gialo development, located in the Libyan Sahara desert, were booked for the first time in 2010.  This development, which is anticipated to take more than five years to develop, is executed by the operator and encompasses a multi-year drilling program including the design, fabrication and installation of extensive liquid handling and gas recycling facilities.  Anecdotal evidence from similar development projects in the region lead to an expected project execution time frame of more than five years from the time the reserves were initially booked.  Interruptions associated with the civil unrest in 2011 and third-party labor strikes and civil unrest in 2013-2014 have also extended the project duration.

As ofDecember 31, 2014, future development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves related to continuing operations for the years2015through2019are projected to be $2,915 million, $2,598 million, $2,493 million, $2,669 million and $2,745 million.

Marketing and Midstream

Our operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our liquid hydrocarbon, synthetic crude oil and natural gas production.  These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production.  We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points.  Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale.

As discussed previously, we currently own and operate gathering systems and other midstream assets in some of our production areas.  We continue to evaluate midstream infrastructure investments in connection with our development plans.

Delivery Commitments

We have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and synthetic crude oil to customers under a variety of contracts.  As ofDecember 31, 2014, those contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to liquid hydrocarbon production in the Eagle Ford and Bakken, and OSM synthetic crude oil production.  Eagle Ford liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments range from a minimum of 76 mbbld increasing to 113 mbbld in 2015 through 2018 and 51 mbbld to 65 mbbld in 2019 through 2020.   Bakken liquid hydrocarbon production sales commitments of 10 mbbld commence in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expire June 1, 2026.  Synthetic crude oil production sales commitments fall under a 3-year agreement for 13.5 mbbld which expires July 2017.  Our current production rates, forecasts and proved reserves are sufficient to meet these commitments.  All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate.

In addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production.  Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms.

Competition and Market Conditions

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves.  We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties.  Based upon statistics compiled in the "2014Global Upstream Performance Review" published by IHS Inc., we rank tenth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of2013worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.

We also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America.  Additional synthetic crude oil projects are being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market.  Because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.

Our operating results are affected by price changes for liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve.  Generally, results from oil and gas production and OSM operations benefit from higher liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas prices.  Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations.  See Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Overview – Market Conditions for additional discussion of the impact of prices on our operations.










Environmental, Health and Safety Matters

The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters.  Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs.  We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties.

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety.  These laws and regulations include the Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA") with respect to the protection of the health and safety of employees, the Clean Air Act ("CAA") with respect to air emissions, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (also known as the Clean Water Act ("CWA")) with respect to water discharges, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA") with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 ("OPA-90") with respect to oil pollution and response, the National Environmental Policy Act with respect to evaluation of environmental impacts, the Endangered Species Act with respect to the protection of endangered or threatened species, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal and the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act with respect to the dissemination of information relating to certain chemical inventories.  In addition, many other states and countries in which we operate have their own laws dealing with similar matters.

These laws and regulations could result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal.  In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them.  New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new rules can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.  Based on regulatory trends, particularly with respect to the CAA and its implementing regulations, we have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations.  We believe that substantially all of our competitors must comply with similar environmental laws and regulations.  However, the specific impact on each competitor may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities, marketing areas and production processes.

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.

Air and Climate Change

The EPA proposed a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone in December 2014.   A more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process.  Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with any regulation or other action by the EPA that lowers the ozone NAAQS, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented.










operations, we could be required to forego construction, modification or certain operations.  These regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.  Obtaining permits may delay the development of our oil and natural gas projects, including the construction and operation of facilities.

In 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions.  Further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding potential methane regulation by EPA).  These requirements apply or could apply in countries in which we operate.  Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations.  The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time.  For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.  As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations.  We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates.  In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.

Hydraulic Fracturing

Increased regulation and attention given to the hydraulic fracturing process could lead to greater opposition to oil and gas activities using hydraulic fracturing techniques.  Additional legislation or regulation could also lead to operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from the developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.  The adoption of any federal, state or local laws or the implementation of regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could potentially cause a decrease in the completion of new oil and gas wells and increased compliance costs, which could increase costs of our operations and cause considerable delays in acquiring regulatory approvals to drill and complete wells.

Transportation

A number of state and federal rules apply to the transportation of liquid hydrocarbons.  In 2014, the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) proposed a rule relating to testing and classification of liquid hydrocarbons and imposing additional restrictions on the types of rail cars that may be used in certain types of liquid hydrocarbon service.  Although our businesses do not own rail cars and purchasers of our liquid hydrocarbons make arrangements for its transportation, such regulations could increase transportation costs which are passed on to Marathon Oil by liquid hydrocarbon purchasers.  We anticipate a final rule sometime in 2015.  In addition, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, a sub-agency of DOT, has proposed or announced the intention to propose various rules related to pipeline transportation of natural gas and/or liquid hydrocarbons.  Such regulations could increase the regulatory burden on our businesses where we own or operate pipelines, or could otherwise increase costs to third parties that are passed on to Marathon Oil.

Remediation

The AOSP operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from open-pit mines, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils.  Tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds.  The AOSP is required to reclaim its tailings ponds as part of its ongoing reclamation work.  The reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan.  The AOSP continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate alternate tailings management technologies.  In February 2009, the ERCB issued a directive which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings.  We believe that we are substantially in compliance with the directive at this time.  We could incur additional costs if further new regulations are issued or if we fail to comply in a timely manner.










Water

In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and its various programs.  If finalized as proposed, this expansion will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping, and recording for some of our facilities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries.  The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate.  For2014, sales to Shell Oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10 percent of our total revenues.  For2013, sales to Statoil, the purchaser of the majority of our Libyan crude oil, accounted for approximately 10 percent of our annual revenues.  For2012, sales to Statoil accounted for approximately 15 percent of our total revenues, while sales to Shell Oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 12 percent of our annual revenues.

Trademarks, Patents and Licenses

We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications.  Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.

Employees

We had3,330active, full-time employees as ofDecember 31, 2014.  We consider labor relations with our employees to be satisfactory.  We have not had any work stoppages or strikes pertaining to our employees.
