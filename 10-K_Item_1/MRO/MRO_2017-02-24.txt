Segment and Geographic Information

For reportable operating segment and geographic financial information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note7to the consolidated financial statements.

In the following discussion regarding our North America E&P, International E&P and Oil Sands Mining segments, references to net wells, acres, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.

North America E&P Segment

We are engaged in oil and gas exploration, development and production activities in the U.S.  Our primary focus in the North America E&P segment is concentrated within our three quality unconventional resource plays.

North America E&P-- Unconventional Resource Plays

Oklahoma Resource Basins– We hold approximately 365,000 net surface acres and includes 61,000 net acres added in the PayRock acquisition in the STACK Meramec play during 2016.  In the SCOOP and STACK areas we hold net acres with rights to the Woodford, Springer, Meramec, Osage, Oswego, Granite Wash and other Pennsylvanian and Mississippian plays.  Our primary 2017 focus will be in the Meramec play in the STACK and the Woodford and Springer plays in the SCOOP.

Eagle Ford- We hold approximately 145,000 net acres in south Texas where we have been operating since 2011. We operate more than 1,365 gross (962 net) producing wells, 32 central gathering and treating facilities and approximately 865 miles of gathering pipeline in the Eagle Ford.  We also own and operate the Sugarloaf gathering system, a 42-mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of our acreage in Karnes, Atascosa and Bee Counties of south Texas.

Approximately 95% of the crude oil and condensate production is transported by pipeline with connections to multiple sales points.  The ability to transport more barrels by pipeline enables us to improve/optimize price realizations, reduce costs, improve reliability and lessen our environmental footprint.

Bakken– We hold approximately 270,000 net acres in North Dakota and eastern Montana, where we have been operating since 2006.  Our large scale water gathering system is handling nearly 70% of our produced water.  We are currently transporting about 75% of our oil production on pipeline.  In an effort to optimize price realizations, we sell our production in local North Dakota markets and to select purchasers who may elect to transport outside of the state.

Other North America

Our remaining properties in North America primarily consist of a number of outside operated assets in the Gulf of Mexico, the largest of which is the Gunflint field located on Mississippi Canyon Blocks 948, 949, 992 (N/2) and 993 (N/2).  The Gunflint field, in which we hold an 18% non-operated working interest, achieved first oil in the third quarter of 2016.

In 2016, we continued our progress on portfolio management, with approximately$1.3 billionof non-core assets sales, which mainly included Wyoming and West Texas properties. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note6to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.

International E&P Segment

We are engaged in a range of activities, including oil and gas exploration, development and production across our international locations in E.G., Gabon, the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Libya and the U.K.  We include the results of our natural gas liquefaction operations and methanol production operations in E.G. in our International E&P segment.

Africa

Equatorial Guinea–Production– We own a 63% operated working interest under a PSC in the Alba field which is offshore E.G.  Operational availability from our company-operated facilities averaged approximately 97% in2016.

Equatorial Guinea–Gas Processing –We own a 52% interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee, which operates an onshore LPG processing plant located on Bioko Island.  Alba field natural gas, under a long-term contract at a fixed price per btu, is processed by the LPG plant.   The LPG plant extracts secondary condensate and LPG from the natural gas stream and uses some of the remaining dry natural gas in its operations.

We also own 60% of EGHoldings and 45% of AMPCO, both of which are accounted for as equity method investments.  EGHoldings operates a 3.7 mmta LNG production facility and AMPCO operates a methanol plant, both located on Bioko Island.  These facilities allow us to further monetize natural gas production from the Alba field.  AMPCO had gross sales totaling 1,100 mt in2016.  Methanol production is sold to customers in Europe and the U.S.

The LNG production facility sells LNG under a 3.4 mmta, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement.  Under the agreement, which runs through 2023, the purchaser takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index.  Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.6 mmta in 2016.








Libya– We hold a 16% non-operated working interest in the Waha concessions, which encompass almost 13 million gross acres located in the Sirte Basin of eastern Libya. Civil and political unrest has interrupted our production operations in recent years.  During 2016, Force Majeure was lifted in September, production commenced shortly thereafter and liftings resumed in December.  See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note12to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our Libya operations.

Other International

United Kingdom– Our operated asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42% working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields, a 39% working interest in the East Brae field, and a 28% working interest in the nearby Braemar field.

The strategic location of the Brae platforms, along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure, has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986.  Currently, the operators of 31 third-party fields are contracted to use the Brae system and 72 mboed are being processed or transported through the Brae infrastructure.  In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business optimizes infrastructure usage.

The working interest owners of the Brae area producing assets collectively own a 50% non-operated interest in the SAGE pipeline system, which has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 bcf per day.  The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 0.3 bcf per day of third-party natural gas.

We own non-operated working interests in the Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28% working interest in the main Foinaven field, a 47% working interest in East Foinaven and a 20% working interest in the T35 and T25 fields.  The export of Foinaven liquid hydrocarbons is via shuttle tanker from an FPSO to market.  All natural gas sales are to the non-operated Magnus platform for use as injection gas.

Kurdistan Region of Iraq– In 2016, we relinquished to the Kurdistan Regional Government our 45% operated working interest in the Harir block located northeast of Erbil.  We have non-operated interests in two blocks located north-northwest of Erbil: Atrush with a 15% working interest and Sarsang with a 20% working interest.

International E&P Exploration

Equatorial Guinea – Exploration – We hold a 63% operated working interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and an 80% operated working interest in the Corona well on Block D. We plan to develop Block D through unitization with the Alba field.  Negotiations have been substantially completed and we are awaiting approval from the host government.

Gabon – Exploration – We hold a 21.25% non-operated working interest in the Diaba License G4-223 and its related permit offshore Gabon, and a 100% participating interest and operatorship in the Tchicuate block where we have an exploration and production sharing agreement.

In 2015, we entered into agreements to sell our East Africa exploration acreage in Ethiopia and Kenya. This transaction closed during the first quarter of 2016.  See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note6to the consolidated financial statements for information about these dispositions.

Oil Sands Mining Segment

We hold a 20% non-operated interest in the AOSP, an oil sands mining and upgrading joint venture located in Alberta, Canada.  Other JV partners include Shell Canada Limited with a 60% ownership interest and Chevron Canada Limited with a 20% ownership interest.  Shell Canada Limited operates the joint venture, which produces bitumen from oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen into synthetic crude oils.  The AOSP’s mining and extraction assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta, and include the Muskeg River and the Jackpine mines.  Gross design capacity of the combined mines is 255,000 (51,000 net) barrels of bitumen per day.

As ofDecember 31, 2016, we own or have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped surface mineable leases totaling approximately 155,000 gross (31,000 net) acres.  The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta.

Reserves

Proved reserves are disclosed by continent and by country if the proved reserves related to any geographic area, on an oil equivalent barrel basis, represent 15% or more of our total proved reserves.  A geographic area can be an individual country, group of countries within a continent or a continent.  Other International ("Other Int’l"), includes the U.K. and the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Approximately 79% of our proved reserves are located in OECD countries.








The following tables set forth estimated quantities of our total proved crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves based upon an SEC pricing for period ended December 31,2016.North AmericaAfricaDecember 31, 2016U.S.CanadaTotalE.G.OtherTotalOther Int'lTotalProved Developed ReservesCrude oil and condensate(mmbbl)238—2384517221713468Natural gas liquids(mmbbl)78—7824—24—102Natural gas(bcf)648—648943951,03851,691Synthetic crude oil(mmbbl)—692692————692Total proved developed reserves(mmboe)4246921,116226188414141,544Proved Undeveloped ReservesCrude oil and condensate (mmbbl)325—325———9334Natural gas liquids (mmbbl)92—92————92Natural gas (bcf)640—640—1101105755Synthetic crude oil(mmbbl)————————Total proved undeveloped reserves  (mmboe)524—524—181810552Total Proved ReservesCrude oil and condensate (mmbbl)563—5634517221722802Natural gas liquids (mmbbl)170—17024—24—194Natural gas (bcf)1,288—1,2889432051,148102,446Synthetic crude oil (mmbbl)—692692————692Total proved reserves (mmboe)9486921,640226206432242,096

As of December 31, 2016, we had total estimated proved reserves of 802 mmbbl of crude oil and condensate, 194 mmbbl of NGLs, 2,446 bcf of natural gas, and 692 mmbbl of synthetic crude oil. Combined, total estimated proved reserves are 2,096 mmboe, of which liquids represents 81 percent. As of December 31, 2016, we had estimated proved developed reserves totaled 1,544 mmboe or 74% and estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaling 552 mmboe or 26% of our total proved reserves.  For additional detail on reserves, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Supplementary Information on Oil and gas Producing Activities.

Preparation of Reserve Estimates

All estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X.  Crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group ("CRG"), which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and his staff of Reserve Coordinators.  Crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are developed or reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators ("QREs").  QREs are petro-technical professionals located throughout our organization who meet the qualifications we have established for employees engaged in estimating reserves and resources. QREs have the education, experience, and training necessary to estimate reserves and resources in a manner consistent with all external reserve estimation regulations and internal resource estimation directives and practices. QREs generally hold at least a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed our QRE training course.  All reserves changes (including proved) must be approved by the CRG. Additionally, any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by the Director of Corporate Reserves.

The Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of New Mexico.  In his 30 years with Marathon Oil, he has held numerous engineering and management positions, including more recently managing reservoir engineering and geoscience for our Eagle Ford development in South Texas.  He is a 25 year member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers ("SPE").

Technologies used in proved reserves estimation includes statistical analysis of production performance, decline curve analysis, pressure and rate transient analysis, pressure gradient analysis, reservoir simulation and volumetric analysis. The








observed statistical nature of production performance coupled with highly certain reservoir continuity or quality within the reliable technology areas and sufficient proved developed locations establish the reasonable certainty criteria required for booking proved reserves.

Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves were prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants of Calgary, Alberta, Canada, third-party consultants during 2015 and 2014. Their reports for all years are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The individual responsible, during 2015 and 2014, for the estimates of our synthetic crude oil reserves had 15 years of experience in petroleum engineering, has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 2009 and is a registered Practicing Professional Engineer in the Province of Alberta.

Audits of Estimates

We engage third-party consultants to provide, at a minimum, independent estimates for fields that comprise 80% of our total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period.  We exceeded this percentage for the four-year period endedDecember 31, 2016, with 84% of our total proved reserves independently audited.  An audit tolerance at a field level of +/- 10%, to our internal estimates, has been established.  Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fall outside our tolerance band, both parties will re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis, if appropriate.  In the very limited instances where differences outside the 10% tolerance cannot be resolved by year end, a plan to resolve the difference is developed and executive management consent is obtained.  The audit process did not result in any significant changes to our reserve estimates for2016,2015or2014.

During2016,2015and2014, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. prepared a reserves certification for the last three reporting periods for the Alba field in E.G.  The NSAI summary reports are filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Members of the NSAI team have multiple years of industry experience, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI.  NSAI’s technical team members meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The senior technical advisor has over 12 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering and the estimation and evaluation of reserves and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.  The second team member has over 10 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences and is a licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas.

Ryder Scott Company also performed audits of the prior years' reserves of several of our fields in2016,2015and2014.  Their summary reports are filed as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 34 years of industry experience, having worked for a major financial advisory services group before joining Ryder Scott.  He is a 25 year member of SPE and is a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.

Acreage

We believe we have satisfactory title to our North America E&P and International E&P properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the industry; nevertheless, we can be involved in title disputes from time to time which may result in litigation.  In the case of undeveloped properties, an investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition.  Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations.  Our title to properties may be subject to burdens such as royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the industry.  In addition, our interests may be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws or burdens such as net profits interests, liens related to operating agreements, development obligations or capital commitments under international PSCs or exploration licenses.

The following table sets forth, by geographic area, the gross and net developed and undeveloped acreage held in our North America E&P and International E&P segments as ofDecember 31, 2016.

In the ordinary course of business, based on our evaluations of certain geologic trends and prospective economics, we have allowed certain lease acreage to expire and may allow additional acreage to expire in the future.  If production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms of the leases, licenses or concessions, additional undeveloped acreage will expire in future years.  We plan to continue the terms of certain of these licenses and concession areas or retain leases through operational or administrative actions.

Marketing

Our reportable operating segments include activities related to the marketing and transportation of substantially all of our crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil.  These activities include the transportation of production to market centers, the sale of commodities to third parties and the storage of production.  We balance our various sales, storage and transportation positions in order to aggregate volumes to satisfy transportation commitments and to achieve flexibility within product types and delivery points.  Such activities can include the purchase of commodities from third parties for resale.

Delivery Commitments

We have committed to deliver quantities of crude oil and condensate, NGLs, natural gas and synthetic crude oil to customers under a variety of contracts.  As ofDecember 31, 2016, the contracts for fixed and determinable quantities were at variable, market-based pricing and related primarily to the following sales commitments:

All of these contracts provide the options of delivering third-party volumes or paying a monetary shortfall penalty if production is inadequate.  Certain volumetric requirements can also be met through purchases of third-party volumes.  In addition to the sales contracts discussed above, we have entered into numerous agreements for transportation and processing of our equity production.  Some of these contracts have volumetric requirements which could require monetary shortfall penalties if our production is inadequate to meet the terms.








Competition

Competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves.  We compete with major integrated and independent oil and gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties.  See Item 1A. Risk Factors for discussion of specific areas in which we compete and related risks.

We also compete with other producers of synthetic crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America.  Because not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic crude oil in significant volumes, sufficient market demand may not exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.

Environmental, Health and Safety Matters

The Health, Environmental, Safety and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental, health and safety matters.  Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations.  Committees comprised of certain of our officers review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs.  We also have a Corporate Emergency Response Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties.

Our businesses are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, health and safety at the national, state and local levels. These laws and their implementing regulations and other similar state and local laws and rules can impose certain operational controls for minimization of pollution, recordkeeping, monitoring and reporting requirements or other operational or siting constraints on our business, result in costs to remediate releases of regulated substances, including crude oil, into the environment, or require costs to remediate sites to which we sent regulated substances for disposal.  In some cases, these laws can impose strict liability for the entire cost of clean-up on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of others (such as prior owners or operators of our assets) or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them.  We have incurred and will continue to incur capital, operating and maintenance, and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations.

New laws have been enacted and regulations are being adopted by various regulatory agencies on a continuing basis and the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations can only be broadly appraised until their implementation becomes more defined.

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.

The EPA finalized a more stringent National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ozone in October 2015.  This more stringent ozone NAAQS could result in additional areas being designated as non-attainment, including areas in which we operate, which may result in an increase in costs for emission controls and requirements for additional monitoring and testing, as well as a more cumbersome permitting process.  Although there may be an adverse financial impact (including compliance costs, potential permitting delays and increased regulatory requirements) associated with this revised regulation, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot be reliably or accurately estimated due to the present uncertainty regarding any additional measures and how they will be implemented. The EPA's final rule has been judicially challenged by both industry and other interested parties, and the outcome of this litigation may also impact implementation and revisions to the rule.

In June 2016, the EPA published a suite of final rules specifically targeting methane emissions from the oil and gas industry, aggregation of air emissions sources and minor source permitting for operations on tribal lands. The EPA has also announced that it intends to impose methane emission standards for existing sources and has issued information collection requests for oil and natural gas facilities. We are currently evaluating the impact of these rules on our operations.  If we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego construction or implement modifications to certain operations. These regulations may also increase compliance costs for some facilities we own or operate, and result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.








In 2010, the EPA promulgated rules that require us to monitor and submit an annual report on our greenhouse gas emissions.  In October 2015, the EPA finalized rules that added new sources to the scope of the greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting requirements. These new sources include gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. The revisions also include the addition of well identification reporting requirements for certain facilities.  Further, state, national and international requirements to reduce greenhouse emissions are being proposed and in some cases promulgated (see discussion above regarding regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry by the EPA).  Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations.  The cost to comply with these laws and regulations cannot be estimated at this time.

In November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued a final rule to further restrict venting and/or flaring of gas from facilities subject to BLM jurisdiction, and to modify certain royalty requirements.  These regulations are currently subject to a challenge under the Congressional Review Act, which if successful, would result in complete withdrawal of these requirements.  If not withdrawn, this rule is expected to result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.  If we are unable to comply with the terms of these regulations, we could be required to forego certain operations. These regulations may also result in administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance.

For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.  As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from our operations.  We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates.  In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable and cost effective.

Hydraulic Fracturing

Hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used process that involves injecting water, sand and small volumes of chemicals into the wellbore to fracture the hydrocarbon-bearing rock thousands of feet below the surface to facilitate higher flow of hydrocarbons into the wellbore. Our business uses this technique extensively throughout our operations.  Hydraulic fracturing has been regulated at the state and local level through permitting and compliance requirements. Federal, state and local-level laws or regulations targeting various aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process are being considered, or have been proposed or implemented. For example, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation that would require additional regulation affecting the hydraulic fracturing process, and may be expected to do so in future legislative sessions. Further, various state and local-level initiatives in regions with substantial shale resources have been or may be proposed or implemented to further regulate hydraulic fracturing practices, limit water withdrawals and water use, require disclosure of fracturing fluid constituents, restrict which additives may be used, or implement temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing.

For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.

Transportation

Water

In 2014, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published proposed regulations which expand the surface waters that are regulated under the Clean Water Act and its various programs. While these regulations were finalized largely as proposed in 2015, the rule has been stayed by the courts pending a substantive decision on the merits.  If this rule is ultimately implemented, the expansion of CWA jurisdiction will result in additional costs of compliance as well as increased monitoring, recordkeeping and recording for some of our facilities.








Concentrations of Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries.  The creditworthiness of customers and other counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. In 2016, sales to Irving Oil and Valero Marketing and Supply and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 17% and 10% of our total revenues. In 2015, sales to Irving Oil and Shell Oil and each of their respective affiliates accounted for approximately 13% and 11% of our total revenues.  In 2014, sales to Shell Oil and its affiliates accounted for approximately 10% of our total revenues.

Trademarks, Patents and Licenses

We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications.  Although in the aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.
