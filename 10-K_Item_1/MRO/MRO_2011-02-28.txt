Item 1. Business

Plan to Create Independent Downstream Company

On January 13, 2011, the Board of Directors of Marathon Oil Corporation (“Marathon”) announced that it has approved moving forward with plans to spin off our downstream (Refining, Marketing
and Transportation) business, creating two independent energy companies: Marathon Petroleum Corporation (“MPC”) and Marathon Oil Corporation (“MRO”). To effect the spin-off, we intend to distribute one common share of MPC for
every two common shares of Marathon held at a record date to be determined. The transaction is expected to be effective June 30, 2011, with distribution of MPC shares shortly thereafter. A tax ruling request was submitted to the U.S. Internal
Revenue Service (“IRS”) regarding the tax-free nature of the spin-off and we anticipate a response during the second quarter of 2011.

The above discussion of the plans to create an independent downstream company includes forward looking statements. Factors which could affect the plans include board approval, receipt of a favorable
private letter ruling from the IRS and a registration statement declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).

General

Marathon
Oil Corporation was originally organized in 2001 as USX HoldCo, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the former USX Corporation. As a result of a reorganization completed in July 2001, USX HoldCo, Inc. (1) became the parent entity of the
consolidated enterprise (the former USX Corporation was merged into a subsidiary of USX HoldCo, Inc.) and (2) changed its name to USX Corporation. In connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph (the “USX
Separation”), USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

Before December 31,
2001, Marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock: USX-Marathon Group common stock, which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business, and USX-U.S. Steel Group common stock (“Steel Stock”), which was intended to
reflect the performance of our steel business. On December 31, 2001, we disposed of our steel business through a tax-free distribution of the common stock of our wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel Corporation (“United States
Steel”) to holders of Steel Stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of Steel Stock on a one-for-one basis.

In connection with the USX Separation, our certificate of incorporation was amended on December 31, 2001, and Marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date.

Segment and Geographic Information

Our operations consist of four reportable operating segments: 1) Exploration and Production (“E&P”) – explores for, produces and markets liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas on a
worldwide basis; 2) Oil Sands Mining (“OSM”) – mines, extracts and transports bitumen from oil sands deposits in Alberta, Canada, and upgrades the bitumen to produce and







Index to Financial Statements

market synthetic crude oil; 3) Integrated Gas (“IG”) – markets and transports products manufactured from natural gas, such as liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) and methanol,
on a worldwide basis; and 4) Refining, Marketing and Transportation (“RM&T”) – refines, transports and markets crude oil and petroleum products, primarily in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and southeastern regions of the United States.
For operating segment and geographic financial information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.

The E&P, OSM and IG segments comprise our upstream operations. The RM&T segment comprises our downstream operations.

Exploration and Production

In the discussion that follows regarding
our exploration and production operations, references to “net” wells, sales or investment indicate our ownership interest or share, as the context requires.

At the end of 2010, we were conducting oil and gas exploration, development or production activities in ten countries:
the United States, Angola, Canada, Equatorial Guinea, Indonesia, Libya, Norway, Poland, the Iraqi Kurdistan Region, and the United Kingdom.

Our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales averaged 245 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”). Our 2010 worldwide net natural gas sales, including natural gas acquired for injection and
subsequent resale, averaged 878 million cubic feet per day (“mmcfd”). In total, our 2010 worldwide net sales averaged 391 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (“mboepd”). For purposes of determining barrels of oil
equivalent (“boe”), natural gas volumes are converted to approximate liquid hydrocarbon barrels by dividing the natural gas volumes expressed in thousands of cubic feet (“mcf”) by six. The liquid hydrocarbon volume is added to
the barrel equivalent of natural gas volume to obtain boe.

In the United States during 2010, we drilled 77
gross (36 net) exploratory wells of which 73 gross (32 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. Of these 73 wells, 35 were temporarily suspended or in the process of being completed at year end. Internationally, we drilled 10
gross (2 net) exploratory wells of which 7 gross (1 net) wells encountered commercial quantities of hydrocarbons. All 7 wells were temporarily suspended or were in the process of being completed at December 31, 2010.

North America

United States– Our U.S. operations accounted for 29 percent of our 2010 worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes and 41 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales volumes.

Offshore – The Gulf of Mexico continues to be a core area, with over 20 prospects. At year end 2010, we
held material interests in seven producing fields, four of which are company operated. An eighth field is under development and anticipated to come on-line in 2011.

Gulf of Mexico Drilling Moratorium – On April 22, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon, a rig that was engaged in
drilling operations in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, sank after an explosion and fire. The incident resulted in a significant oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Marathon had no involvement in the incident.

As a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident, the U.S. Department of the Interior issued a drilling moratorium on
May 30, 2010, to suspend the drilling of deepwater wells, and prohibit drilling any new deepwater wells (defined as greater than 500 foot water depth). Shortly after the moratorium was issued, we temporarily suspended drilling an exploratory
well on the Innsbruck prospect, located on Mississippi Canyon Block 993. Although the drilling moratorium was lifted on October 12, 2010, it is not known when plans and permits will be approved for future deepwater drilling activity. We sent a
Revised Development Operations Coordination Document for the Ozona completion and a Revised Exploration Plan for the Innsbruck well to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management Regulation and Enforcement (“BOEMRE”). We continue to update our
revised Oil Spill Response Plan as new and updated requirements come from the BOEMRE. We filed our first deepwater Exploration Plan since the Deepwater Horizon incident to the BOEMRE on October 15, 2010. We are continuing to engage the BOEMRE
to provide them with all the requested information. The BOEMRE has not yet deemed our plan submitted. The effects of new or additional laws or regulations that may be adopted in response to this incident are not fully known at this time and may
impact future project execution.

We operate the Ewing Bank 873 platform which is located 130 miles south of
New Orleans, Louisiana. The platform started operations in 1994 and serves as a production hub for the Ewing Bank 873 (Lobster), Ewing Bank 917 (Oyster) and Ewing Bank 963 (Arnold) fields. The facility also processes third-party production via
subsea tie-backs.







Index to Financial Statements

We own a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated Petronius field on
Viosca Knoll Blocks 786 and 830. The Petronius platform is capable of providing processing and transportation services to nearby third-party fields.

The Neptune development commenced production of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in July 2008. We hold a 30 percent working interest in this outside-operated development located on Atwater Valley 575,
120 miles off the coast of Louisiana. The completed Phase I development included six subsea wells tied back to a stand-alone platform. Phase II development activities have begun and the first well in this program was successfully drilled and
completed in late 2009.

Our Droshky development in the Gulf of Mexico on Green Canyon Block 244 began
production in mid-July of 2010 and reached peak net production of 45,000 boepd in the third quarter of 2010. Production declines have been steeper than anticipated due to reservoir compartmentalization and lack of aquifer support. This subsea
project consists of four development wells tied back to a third-party platform. Three of the four wells are currently producing. We plan to re-enter the fourth well in the first quarter of 2011. We hold a 100 percent operated working interest and an
81 percent net revenue interest in Droshky.

Development of our operated Ozona prospect, located on Garden
Banks Block 515, has also continued. We are in the process of securing a rig to complete the previously drilled appraisal well and tie back to the nearby third-party Auger platform. First production of liquid hydrocarbon is expected in 2011. We hold
a 68 percent working interest in Ozona.

In 2008, we drilled a successful oil appraisal well on the Stones
prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 508. We hold a 25 percent interest in the outside-operated Stones prospect. In the third quarter of 2008, we announced deepwater oil discovery on the Gunflint prospect located on Mississippi Canyon Block 948.
We own a 13 percent interest in this outside-operated prospect. In the first quarter of 2009, we participated in a deepwater oil discovery on the Shenandoah prospect located on Walker Ridge Block 52. We own a 10 percent interest in the
outside-operated prospect.

In December 2009, we began drilling an exploratory well on the Flying Dutchman
prospect, located on Green Canyon Block 511 in the Gulf of Mexico. We have 63 percent ownership and are the operator of this liquid hydrocarbon prospect. The Flying Dutchman reached its targeted total depth in early May 2010. The well encountered
hydrocarbon-bearing sands that require further technical evaluation. The results of the Flying Dutchman well will continue to be evaluated to determine overall commerciality.

In addition to the prospects listed above, we held interests in 103 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico at the end of 2010,
including 97 in the deepwater area. Our plans call for exploration drilling on some of these leases in 2011 and 2012, presuming a favorable regulatory environment that will allow deep-water drilling to resume.

Onshore – We hold 391,000 net acres in the Bakken shale oil play in the Williston Basin of North Dakota with a
working interest of approximately 80 percent. Approximately 275 company-operated locations will be drilled over the next 4 years. We are evaluating other potential horizons above and below the Middle Bakken. We currently have six operated drilling
rigs running in our Bakken shale program, and will add a rig solely dedicated to completion operations in the first quarter of 2011.

In the Anadarko Woodford shale horizon, a liquids-rich play in Oklahoma, we continue to expand our acreage position and now hold approximately 88,000 net acres within the play. We have existing production
operations in this geographical area which will facilitate early drilling, with initial wells currently in progress. We plan to increase from three to eight company operated rigs in 2011. We also have domestic natural gas operations in Oklahoma,
East Texas, and North Louisiana with combined net gas sales of 103 mmcfd in 2010.

In December 2010, we
entered into an agreement with an operator in the Eagle Ford shale, a liquids-rich play in Texas. We initially paid $10 million and will drill and complete four wells to earn approximately 17,000 net acres. We also have an option that expires
October 31, 2011 to purchase the operator’s remaining 58,000 net acres at a total cost of approximately $209 million, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions. In the event that we do not exercise the purchase
option, the operator has the option to put the remaining 58,000 acres to us at a total cost, including the initial payment, carried well interest and lease extensions, of approximately $92 million.

We hold leases with natural gas production in the Piceance Basin of Colorado, located in Garfield County in the Greater
Grand Valley field complex. We acquired approximately 177,000 net acres within the Niobrara play in the DJ Basin of northern Colorado and southeast Wyoming. We expect to commence drilling in 2011 and will leverage our Bakken operating experience.
Net liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas sales from our existing Wyoming fields averaged 24 mbpd and 106 mmcfd in 2010. We plan to drill approximately 20 company operated wells in 2011 in the Big Horn, Wind River and Powder River Basins.







Index to Financial Statements

We hold acreage in two additional emerging shale resource plays in the U.S.
In the Appalachian Basin we hold 80,000 net acres in the Marcellus shale natural gas play in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In February 2011, we entered into a joint venture with a company on a large portion of our Marcellus shale acreage position.
Under the agreement terms, the company will to earn 50 percent of approximately 60,000 acres under a drilling carry. The company also has an option to acquire our remaining acreage while we retain the rights to continue to market the acreage to
others. We drilled three wells in 2010 and five in 2009. In Louisiana and east Texas, we hold 20,000 net acres in the Haynesville shale natural gas play, where we drilled two wells in 2010 and one in 2009.

We produce natural gas in the Cook Inlet and adjacent Kenai Peninsula of Alaska. We have operated and outside-operated
interests in ten fields and hold a 51 to 100 percent working interest in each. Typically, our natural gas sales from Alaska are seasonal in nature, trending down during the second and third quarters of each year and increasing during the fourth and
first quarters. To manage supplies to meet contractual demand we produce and store natural gas in a partially depleted reservoir in the Kenai natural gas field. In 2010, we drilled three operated wells in Alaska and plan to drill one to three
company-operated wells per year during 2011 and 2012.

Canada– We hold interests in both operated
and outside-operated exploration stage in-situ oil sand leases as a result of the acquisition of Western in 2007. The three potential in-situ developments are Namur, in which we hold a 60 percent operated interest, Birchwood, in which we hold a 100
percent operated interest, and Ells River, in which we hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest. Initial test drilling on the Birchwood prospect confirmed bitumen presence and an additional 70 test wells are planned in 2011 to assess reservoir
quality. Sanction of the initial phase of the Birchwood development is anticipated in 2014, with resulting first production expected in 2016.

Africa

Equatorial Guinea– We own a 63 percent operated working interest in the Alba field which is offshore Equatorial Guinea. During 2010, Equatorial Guinea net liquid hydrocarbon sales were 15
percent of our worldwide net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes, and net natural gas sales were 46 percent of our worldwide net natural gas sales.

We also own a 52 percent interest in Alba Plant LLC, an equity method investee that operates an onshore liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) processing plant. Alba field natural gas is processed by
the LPG plant under a long-term contract at a fixed price for the British thermal units used in the operations of the LPG plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and LPG. During 2010,
a gross 753 mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the LPG production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in 2010 included 3 mbpd of secondary condensate and 11 mbpd of LPG produced by Alba Plant LLC.

As part of our Integrated Gas segment, we own 45 percent of Atlantic Methanol Production Company LLC (“AMPCO”)
and 60 percent of Equatorial Guinea LNG Holdings Limited (“EGHoldings”), both of which are accounted for as equity method investments. AMPCO operates a methanol plant and EGHoldings operates an LNG production facility, both located on
Bioko Island. Dry natural gas from the Alba field, which remains after the condensate and LPG are removed, is supplied to both of these facilities under long-term contracts at fixed prices. Because of the location of and limited local demand for
natural gas in Equatorial Guinea, we consider the prices under the contracts with Alba Plant LLC, AMPCO and EGHoldings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or
similar circumstances. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and LPG produced by Alba Plant LLC is reflected in our E&P segment. Our share of the income ultimately generated by the
subsequent export of methanol produced by AMPCO and LNG produced by EGHoldings is reflected in our Integrated Gas segment as discussed below. During 2010, a gross 108 mmcfd of dry natural gas was supplied to the methanol plant and a gross 623 mmcfd
of dry gas was supplied to the LNG production facility. Any remaining dry gas is returned offshore and reinjected into the Alba field for later production.

We hold a 63 percent operated interest in the Deep Luba discovery on the Alba Block and we are the operator with a 90 percent interest in the Corona well on Block D. These wells are part of our long-term
LNG strategy. We expect these discoveries to be developed when the natural gas supply from the nearby Alba field starts to decline.

Angola–Offshore Angola, we hold 10 percent interests in Block 31 and Block 32, both of which are outside-operated. The discoveries on Blocks 31 and 32 represent four potential
development hubs. The Plutao, Saturno, Venus and Marte discoveries and one successful appraisal well form a planned development area in the northeastern portion of Block 31. In 2008, we received approval to proceed with this first deepwater
development project, called the PSVM development. The PSVM development will utilize a floating, production, storage and offloading (“FPSO”) vessel. A total of 48 production and injection wells are planned with development drilling
currently underway. First production is anticipated in 2012. Other discoveries on Block 31 comprise potential development areas in the southeast and middle portions of the block. A development area in the south eastern portion of Block 32 is
currently being evaluated with the potential to include 6 fields for an anticipated first oil production in 2016.







Index to Financial Statements

Libya– We hold a 16 percent interest in the Waha concessions,
which encompass almost 13 million acres located in the Sirte Basin. Our exploration program in 2010 included the drilling of 10 wells, including 2 carry over wells from 2009: seven of these wells were discoveries, two were dry and abandoned,
and one was drilling as of yearend. We drilled 28 development wells in Libya in 2010. Phase II of the Faregh project began commissioning during the third quarter of 2010, with production coming on line in November.

Europe

Norway– Norway continues to be a core area, which complements our long-standing operations in the U.K. sector of the North Sea discussed below. We were approved for our first operatorship on
the offshore Norwegian continental shelf in 2002, where today we operate ten licenses and hold interests in over 240,000 net acres.

The operated Alvheim complex located on the Norwegian continental shelf commenced production in June 2008. The complex consists of a Floating Production, Storage and Offloading (“FPSO”) vessel
with subsea infrastructure. Improved reliability, combined with optimization work, increased the throughput of the FPSO to 142 mbpd, up from the original design of 120 mbpd. Produced oil is transported by shuttle tanker and produced natural gas is
transported to the existing U.K. Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (“SAGE”) system using a 14-inch diameter, 24-mile cross border pipeline. First production to the complex was from the Alvheim development which is comprised of the Kameleon,
East Kameleon and Kneler fields, in which we have a 65 percent working interest, and the Boa field, in which we have a 58 percent working interest. At the end of 2010, the Alvheim development included 11 producing wells and 2 water disposal wells. A
Phase 2 drilling program commenced in 2010, with 1 well on production since December 2010 and a further two production wells to be drilled in 2011. A Phase 2b drilling program consisting of 2 production wells is planned for 2011 and 2012.

The nearby outside-operated Vilje field, in which we own a 47 percent working interest, began producing
through the Alvheim complex in August 2008.

In June 2009, we completed the drilling program for the Volund
field as a subsea tieback to the Alvheim complex. The Volund development, in which we own a 65 percent operated interest, is located approximately five miles south of the Alvheim area and consists of three production wells and one water injection
well. First production from Volund was announced in September 2009. In the second quarter of 2010, we commenced production at the Volund field which allows us to maintain full capacity on the Alvheim FPSO. Net sales from Alvheim, Vilje, and Volund
for 2010 averaged 50 mbpd of liquid hydrocarbons and 30 mmcfd of natural gas.

Also offshore Norway, we and
our partners announced the Marihone and Viper discoveries, both located within tie-back distance of the Alvheim FPSO. The Marihone oil discovery is located in license PL340 about 12 miles south of the Volund and Alvheim fields. We hold a 65 percent
operated working interest in Marihone. The Viper oil discovery is located immediately next to Volund field in PL203, about 12 miles south of the Alvheim FPSO. We are the operator and hold a 65 percent interest in Viper. Conceptual development
studies for both discoveries have begun. First production for both discoveries is anticipated in 2014.

In
December 2010 a sales agreement was entered into for all of our interests in production licenses PL 025, PL 048E and PL 187. The transaction includes our outside-operated 20 percent interest in PL 025 (Gudrun field development) and PL 187 (Brynhild
discovery), and 12.5 percent interest in PL 048E (Eirin discovery).

United Kingdom– Our largest
asset in the U.K. sector of the North Sea is the Brae area complex where we are the operator and have a 42 percent working interest in the South, Central, North and West Brae fields and a 38 percent working interest in the East Brae field. The Brae
A platform and facilities host the underlying South Brae field and the adjacent Central and West Brae fields. A two well development program commenced in 2010 for West Brae with one well on production in January 2011, and the second expected to
produce by the end of March 2011. The North Brae field, which is produced via the Brae B platform, and the East Brae field, which is produced via the East Brae platform, are natural gas condensate fields. The East Brae platform hosts the nearby
Braemar field in which we have a 28 percent working interest.

The strategic location of the Brae platforms
along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third-party processing and transportation business since 1986. Currently, the operators of 30 third-party fields have contracted to use the Brae system. Most recently, in 2010, we agreed
to commence construction and installation of a new module to accommodate the tie back of the third-party operated Devenick field. In addition to generating processing and pipeline tariff revenue, this third-party business also has a favorable impact
on Brae area operations by optimizing infrastructure usage and extending the economic life of the complex.

The Brae group owns a 50 percent interest in the outside-operated SAGE system. The SAGE pipeline transports natural gas
from the Brae area, and the third-party Beryl area, and has a total wet natural gas capacity of 1.1 billion







Index to Financial Statements

cubic feet (“bcf”) per day. The SAGE terminal at St. Fergus in northeast Scotland processes natural gas from the SAGE pipeline as well as approximately 1 bcf per day of third-party
natural gas.

In the U.K. Atlantic Margin west of the Shetland Islands, we own an average 30 percent working
interest in the outside-operated Foinaven area complex, consisting of a 28 percent working interest in the main Foinaven field, 47 percent working interest in East Foinaven and 20 percent working interest in the T35 and T25 fields. The FPSO is being
upgraded which is expected to extend the life of this asset through 2021.

Poland– In 2010, we
added 10 licenses with shale gas potential in Poland, increasing our total acreage position to approximately 2.3 million net acres in 11 licenses. We have a 100 percent interest and operate all 11 blocks. In 2011 we plan to acquire 2D seismic
over all concessions by the end of the third quarter and plan to initiate drilling in the fourth quarter. We have recently been successful in farming-out a portion of our interest in this play. Under the agreement, our partner will earn a 40 percent
working interest in 10 licenses, as well as pay a promote on certain future seismic and well costs. This transaction is subject to the approval of the Polish Ministry of the Environment. We will remain operator of the 10 licenses included in the
agreement.

Other International

Indonesia– We are the operator and hold a 70 percent interest in the Pasangkayu Block located both onshore & offshore Sulawesi in the Makassar Strait, Indonesia. The Pasangkayu Block
covers an area of approximately 872,000 acres and is located directly east of the Kutei Basin production region. The production sharing contract with the Indonesian government was signed in 2006 and we completed 3D seismic acquisition in May 2008.

In November 2010, the Bravo-1 well in the northeastern portion of the Pasangkayu block was drilled in a water
depth of approximately 3,200 feet and reached a total depth of 9,000 feet. No hydrocarbon accumulations were present.

The Romeo prospect, located on the north-central portion of the Pasangkayu block in a water depth of 6,200 feet, is being drilled and is expected to be completed during the first half of 2011.

In 2009, we were awarded a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the Kumawa Block, an Indonesia offshore exploration
block, located offshore West Papua. An increase in ownership to 55 percent received Indonesian government approval in late 2010. The Kumawa Block encompasses 1.24 million acres. A seismic survey was acquired in 2010 and we expect to drill one
exploration well in 2012.

In October 2008, we were granted a 49 percent interest and operatorship in the Bone
Bay Block offshore Sulawesi. An increase in ownership to 55 percent received Indonesian government approval in late 2010. The Bone Bay Block covers an area of 1.23 million acres and is 200 miles southeast of our Pasangkayu Block. A 2D seismic
survey was acquired in 2009 and we expect to drill one exploration well in early 2012.

We continue to pursue
joint study agreements in Indonesia, which provide a right of first refusal in future bid rounds. We completed one joint study agreement in 2010 and continue to evaluate regional potential for other opportunities.

Iraqi Kurdistan Region– In October 2010, we acquired a position in four exploration blocks in the Kurdistan
Region of Iraq. We have signed production sharing agreements for operatorship and an 80 percent ownership in two open blocks northeast of Erbil; Harir and Safen. The Kurdistan Regional Government (“KRG”) will hold a 20 percent carried
interest. We were assigned working interests in two additional blocks located north-northwest of Erbil; Atrush, in which we have a 16 percent ownership (KRG holds a 4 percent carried interest), and Sarsang, in which we have a 20 ownership (KRG holds
a 4 percent carried interest). These contracts provide us with access to approximately 368,000 net acres. We have committed to a seismic program and to drilling one well on each of the two open blocks during the initial three-year exploration
period. The Atrush and Sarsang blocks each have one well currently drilling.

Divestitures

Angola –In February 2010, we closed the sale of an undivided 20 percent interest in the outside-operated
production sharing contract and joint operating agreement on Block 32 offshore Angola effective January 1, 2009. We retained a 10 percent interest in Block 32.

The above discussion of the E&P segment includes forward-looking statements with respect to anticipated future
exploratory and development drilling, the timing of production from the Ozona development in the Gulf of Mexico, the PSVM development on Block 31 offshore Angola and Block 32 and other possible developments. Some factors which could possible affect
these forward-looking statements include pricing, supply and demand for petroleum products, the amount of capital available for exploration and development, regulatory constraints, drilling rig availability, unforeseen hazards such as weather
conditions, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorist acts and the governmental or military response, and







Index to Financial Statements

other geological, operating and economic considerations. The foregoing forward-looking statements may be further affected by the inability to obtain or delay in obtaining necessary government and
third-party approvals and permits. The offshore developments could further be affected by presently known data concerning size and character of reservoirs, economic recoverability, future drilling success and production experience. The foregoing
factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Oil Sands Mining

We hold a 20 percent outside-operated interest in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project (“AOSP”), an oil sands mining joint venture located in Alberta, Canada. The joint venture produces bitumen from
oil sands deposits in the Athabasca region utilizing mining techniques and upgrades the bitumen to synthetic crude oils. The AOSP’s mining and extractions assets are located near Fort McMurray, Alberta and include the Muskeg River mine which
began bitumen production in 2003 and the Jackpine mine which commenced phased start-up in the third quarter of 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we have rights to participate in developed and undeveloped leases totaling approximately 215,000 gross
(45,000 net) acres. The underlying developed leases are held for the duration of the project, with royalties payable to the province of Alberta. The upgrading assets are located at Fort Saskatchewan, northeast of Edmonton, Alberta.

The first fully integrated expansion of the existing AOSP facilities was approved in 2006. Expansion 1 includes
construction of mining and extraction facilities at the Jackpine mine, new treatment facilities at the existing Muskeg River mine, addition of a new processing train at the Scotford upgrader and development of related infrastructure. A







Index to Financial Statements

phased start-up of the Jackpine mine operations began in the third quarter of 2010. At full capacity, the Jackpine mine will add 100,000 gross bpd to our previously existing capacity. The
expanded upgrader began the commissioning and start-up phase, which will continue into early 2011. Stage 1 debottlenecking activities are scheduled to begin in 2011. Potential future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain
under review.

A planned turnaround at the Muskeg River mine and the upgrader occurred from March through May
2010. Our net share of turnaround costs was $99 million. Production as the AOSP was halted in April 2010 before a staged resumption of operations in mid-May 2010.

Current AOSP operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open-pit mine, extract the bitumen
and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques. The mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are
further reduced to smaller particles. The particles are combined with hot water to create slurry. The slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand, clay and bitumen-rich froth. A solvent is added to the bitumen froth to
separate out the remaining solids, water and heavy asphaltenes. The solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently. The process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then
transported from the mine to the Scotford upgrader via the approximately 300 mile Corridor Pipeline.

The
bitumen is upgraded at Scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products. Blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our
saleable products. The three major products that the Scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil, heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil. The vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at
market-related prices, and the other products are sold in the marketplace.

The above discussion of the Oil
Sands Mining segment includes forward-looking statements concerning the start-up of the expanded upgrader. Factors which could affect this project include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as
weather conditions and delays or other risks customarily associated with start-up projects.

(b)Our businesses in Ireland and Gabon were sold in 2009 and were reported as discontinued operations.

We previously reported OSM segment reserves as bitumen because oil sands mining was not considered an oil and gas
producing activity by the SEC. Proved bitumen reserves reported as of December 31, 2008 were 388 mmboe.

The above estimated quantities of net proved liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas reserves are forward-looking statements
and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry
economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations. The above estimated quantities of synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on presently known
physical data, economic recoverability and operating conditions. To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates. For additional details of the estimated quantities
of proved reserves at the end of each of the last three years, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data— Supplementary Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities.

Preparation of Reserve Estimates

Our estimation of economically producible volumes of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas is a highly technical process performed primarily by in-house teams of reservoir engineers and geoscience
professionals. All estimates of reserves are made in compliance with SEC Rule 4-10 of Regulation S-X. Beginning December 31, 2009, reserve estimates are based upon the unweighted average of closing prices for the first day of each month in the
respective 12-month period ended December 31. In 2008, reserve estimates were based on prices at December 31.

Liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Corporate Reserves Group, which includes our Director of Corporate Reserves and her staff of
Coordinators. Reserves estimates are developed and reviewed by Qualified Reserves Estimators (“QRE”). QRE are engineers or geoscientists with a minimum of a Bachelor of Science degree in the appropriate technical field, have a minimum of
three years of industry experience with at least one year in reserve estimation and have completed Marathon’s Qualified Reserve Estimator training course. The Reserve Coordinators review all reserves estimates for all fields with proved
reserves greater than 3 mmboe at a minimum of once every three years. Any change to proved reserve estimates in excess of 2.5 mmboe on a total field basis, within a single month, must be approved by Corporate Reserves Group management. All
other proved reserve changes must be approved by a Reserve Coordinator.

Our
Director of Corporate Reserves, who reports to our Chief Financial Officer, has a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering and a master of business administration. Her 36 years of experience in the industry include 25 with Marathon. She
is active in industry and professional groups, having served on the Society of Petroleum Engineers (“SPE”) Oil and Gas Reserves Committee (“OGRC”) since 2004, chairing in 2008 and 2009. As a member of the OGRC, she participated
in the development of the Petroleum Resource Management System (“PRMS”) and served on the Technical Program Committee for a 2007 SPE Reserves Estimation Workshop: Sharing the Vision focusing on PRMS. She chaired the development of the OGRC
comments on the SEC’s proposed modernization of oil and gas reporting and was a member of the American Petroleum Institute’s Ad Hoc group that provided comments on the same topic.

Estimates of synthetic crude oil reserves
are prepared by GLJ Petroleum Consultants of Calgary, Canada, third-party consultants. A copy of their December 31, 2010 report is filed as Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K. The engineer responsible for the estimates of our oil sands mining
reserves has 32 years of experience in petroleum engineering and has conducted surface mineable oil sands evaluations since 1986. He is a member of SPE, having served as regional director 1998 through 2001 and is a registered Practicing Professional
Engineer in the Province of Alberta.

Audits of Estimates

Third-party consultants are engaged to audit the in-house reserve estimates for fields that comprise 80 percent of our
total proved reserves over a rolling four-year period. We met this goal for the four-year period ended December 31, 2010, without conducting any third party audits in 2010. We established a tolerance level of 10 percent for reserve audits such
that initial estimates by the third-party consultants are accepted if they are within 10 percent of our internal estimates. Should the third-party consultants’ initial analysis fail to reach our tolerance level, both our team and the
consultants re-examine the information provided, request additional data and refine their analysis if appropriate. This resolution process is continued until both estimates are within 10 percent. This process did not result in significant changes to
our reserve estimates in 2009 or 2008.

Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”) prepared an
independent estimate of December 31, 2008 reserves for the Alba field in Equatorial Guinea. This reserve estimate was used by Corporate Reserves in much the same way third-party audits are now used. The NSAI summary report is Exhibit 99.2 to
this Form 10-K. The senior members of the NSAI team have over fifty years of industry experience between them, having worked for large, international oil and gas companies before joining NSAI. The team lead has a master of science in mechanical
engineering and is a member of SPE. The senior technical advisor has a bachelor of science in geophysics and is a member of the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and the European Association of
Geoscientists and Engineers. Both are licensed in the state of Texas.

Ryder Scott Company (“Ryder
Scott”) performed audits of several of our fields in 2009. Their summary report on audits performed in 2009 is Exhibit 99.3 to this Form 10-K. The team lead for Ryder Scott has over 19 years of industry experience, having worked for a major
international oil and gas company before joining Ryder Scott. He has a bachelor of science in mechanical engineering, is a member of SPE and is a registered Professional Engineer in the state of Texas.

The Corporate Reserves Group may also perform separate, detailed technical reviews of reserve estimates for significant
fields that were acquired recently or for properties with problematic indicators such as excessively long lives, sudden changes in performance or changes in economic or operating conditions.

Changes in Proved Undeveloped Reserves

As of
December 31, 2010, 405 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves were reported, a decrease of 87 mmboe from December 31, 2009. The following table shows of the changes in total proved undeveloped reserves for 2010:



Beginning of year492Revisions of previous estimates(30)Extensions, discoveries, and other additions71Transfer to developed(128)End of year405

Significant additions to proved undeveloped reserves during 2010 include 28 mmboe for development drilling in our Libya properties and 19 mmboe additional for development drilling in the Bakken Shale
play. Revisions include 26 mmboe of proved undeveloped reserves reclassified as proved developed in Equatorial Guinea because operating pressures can be reduced more than originally anticipated with the existing equipment. Transfers include the
movement of 67 mmboe from proved undeveloped to proved developed due to start up for the Jackpine mine Expansion 1 in Canada and 26 mmboe related to the commencement of production at the Gulf of Mexico Droshky development in July 2010. Costs
incurred in the periods ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 relating to the development of proved undeveloped reserves, were $1,463 million, $792 million and $1,189 million.

Projects can remain in proved undeveloped reserves for extended periods in certain situations such as behind-pipe zones
where reserves will not be accessed until the primary producing zone depletes, large development projects which take more than five years to complete, and the timing of when additional gas compression is needed. Of the 405 mmboe of proved
undeveloped reserves at year end 2010, 30 percent of the volume is associated with projects that have been included in proved reserves for more than five years. The majority of this volume is related to a compression project in







Index to Financial Statements

Equatorial Guinea that was sanctioned by our Board of Directors in 2004 and is expected to be completed in 2015. The timing of the installation of compression is being deferred as a result of
better than expected reservoir performance. In addition, the North Gialo project in Libya is being executed by the operator, encompassing a continuous drilling program and designing, fabricating, and installing extensive liquid handling and gas
recycling facilities. In 2010, an engineering firm was awarded the bid for the front-end engineering and design activities. Long lead items are expected to be procured in 2011 and first production is expected in 2016. There are no other significant
undeveloped reserves expected to be developed more than five years.

As of December 31, 2010, future
development costs estimated to be required for the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves for the years 2011 through 2015 are projected to be $884 million, $315 million, $379 million, $433
million, and $224 million.

The timing of future projects and estimated future development costs relating to
the development of proved undeveloped liquid hydrocarbon, natural gas and synthetic crude oil reserves are forward-looking statements and are based on a number of assumptions, including (among others) commodity prices, presently known physical data
concerning size and character of the reservoirs, economic recoverability, technology developments, future drilling success, industry economic conditions, levels of cash flow from operations, production experience and other operating considerations.
To the extent these assumptions prove inaccurate, actual recoveries and development costs could be different than current estimates.

Integrated Gas

Our integrated gas operations include natural gas liquefaction and regasification operations and methanol production
operations. Also included in the financial results of the Integrated Gas segment are the costs associated with ongoing development of projects to link stranded natural gas resources with key demand areas.

We hold a 60 percent interest in EGHoldings, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. EGHoldings has
a 3.7 million metric tonnes per annum (“mmtpa”) LNG production facility on Bioko Island in Equatorial Guinea. LNG from the production facility is sold under a 3.4 mmtpa, or 460 mmcfd, sales and purchase agreement with a 17-year term
ending in 2024. The purchaser under the agreement takes delivery of the LNG on Bioko Island, with pricing linked principally to the Henry Hub index, regardless of destination. This production facility allows us to monetize our natural gas reserves
from the Alba field, as natural gas for the facility is purchased from the Alba field participants under a long-term natural gas supply agreement. Gross sales of LNG from this production facility totaled 3.7 million metric tonnes in 2010. In
2010, we continued discussions with the government of Equatorial Guinea and our partners regarding a potential second LNG production facility on Bioko Island.

We own a 30 percent outside-operated interest in a natural gas liquefaction plant in Kenai Alaska. This facility began first production in 1969 and we currently lease one 87,500 cubic meter tankers to
transport LNG to customers in Japan. In February 2011 we, along with the plant operator, announced that exports would cease in spring of 2011.

We own a 45 percent interest in AMPCO, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. AMPCO owns a methanol plant located in Malabo, Equatorial Guinea. Feedstock for the plant is supplied
from our natural gas production from the Alba field. Gross sales of methanol from the plant totaled 850,605 metric tonnes in 2010. Production from the plant is used to supply customers in Europe and the U.S.







Index to Financial Statements

The above discussion of the Integrated Gas segment contains forward-looking
statements with respect to the possible expansion of the LNG production facility in Equatorial Guinea. Factors that could potentially affect the possible expansion of the LNG production facility include partner and government approvals, access to
sufficient natural gas volumes through exploration or commercial negotiations with other resource owners and access to sufficient regasification capacity. The foregoing factors (among others) could cause actual results to differ materially from
those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

Refining, Marketing and Transportation

We have refining, marketing and transportation operations concentrated primarily in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and Southeast
regions of the U.S. We rank as the fifth largest crude oil refiner in the U.S. and the largest in the Midwest. Our operations include a six-plant refining network and an integrated terminal and transportation system which supplies wholesale and
Marathon-brand customers as well as our own retail operations. Our wholly-owned retail marketing subsidiary Speedway LLC (“Speedway”) is one of the largest company-owned and -operated retail gasoline and convenience stores in the U.S.

In December 2010, we sold our St. Paul Park, Minnesota, refinery (including associated terminal, tankage and
pipeline investments and 166 SuperAmerica retail outlets (collectively, “Minnesota Assets”). Operations for the Minnesota Assets are included in all of the annual statistics reported.

Refining

We currently own and operate six refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 1,142 thousand barrels per day (“mbpd”) of crude oil as detailed in the table below.



Crude Oil Refining Capacity(mbpd)Garyville, Louisiana464Catlettsburg, Kentucky212Robinson, Illinois206Detroit, Michigan106Canton, Ohio78Texas City, Texas76Total1,142

During 2010, our refineries processed 1,173 mbpd of crude oil and 162 mbpd of other charge and blend stocks. Our refineries include crude oil atmospheric and vacuum distillation, fluid catalytic cracking,
catalytic reforming, desulfurization and sulfur recovery units. The refineries process a wide variety of crude oils and produce numerous refined products, ranging from transportation fuels, such as reformulated gasolines, blend-grade gasolines
intended for blending with fuel ethanol and ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel, to heavy fuel oil and asphalt. Additionally, we manufacture aromatics, cumene, propane, propylene, and sulfur.

Our Garyville, Louisiana, refinery is located along the Mississippi River in southeastern Louisiana between New Orleans
and Baton Rouge. The Garyville refinery is configured to processes heavy sour crude oil into products such as gasoline, distillates, sulfur, asphalt, propane, polymer grade propylene, isobutane and coke. An expansion project was completed in the
fourth quarter of 2009 that increased Garyville’s crude oil refining capacity, making it one of the largest refineries in the U.S. Our Garyville refinery has earned designation as a U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)
Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR site.

Our Catlettsburg, Kentucky, refinery is located in northeastern
Kentucky on the western bank of the Big Sandy River, near the confluence with the Ohio River. The Catlettsburg refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, asphalt, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals, propane, propylene
and sulfur.

Our Robinson, Illinois, refinery is located in southeastern Illinois. The Robinson refinery
processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as multiple grades of gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, diesel fuel, propane, propylene, sulfur and anode-grade coke. The Robinson refinery has earned designation as an OSHA VPP STAR site.

Our Detroit, Michigan, refinery is located near Interstate 75 in southwest Detroit. It is the only petroleum
refinery currently operating in Michigan. The Detroit refinery processes light sweet and heavy sour crude oils, including Canadian crude oils, into products such as gasoline, diesel, asphalt, slurry, propane, chemical grade propylene and sulfur. In
2007, we approved a heavy oil upgrading and expansion project at this refinery, with a current projected cost of $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized interest). This project will enable the refinery to process an additional 80 mbpd of heavy sour
crude oils, including Canadian bitumen blends, and will increase its crude oil refining capacity by about 15 mbpd. Construction

began in the first half of 2008 and reached 50 percent completion at December 31, 2010. The project is expected to be complete in the second half of 2012. Our Detroit refinery is certified
as a Michigan VPP STAR site.

Our Canton, Ohio, refinery is located approximately 60 miles southeast of
Cleveland, Ohio. The Canton refinery processes sweet and sour crude oils into products such as gasoline, diesel fuels, kerosene, propane, sulfur, asphalt, roofing flux, home heating oil and No. 6 industrial fuel oil.

Our Texas City, Texas, refinery is located on the Texas Gulf Coast approximately 30 miles south of Houston, Texas. The
refinery processes sweet crude oil into products such as gasoline, propane, chemical grade propylene, slurry, sulfur and aromatics.

The above discussion includes forward-looking statements concerning the Detroit refinery heavy oil upgrading and expansion project. Some factors that could affect this project include transportation
logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party approvals and other risks customarily associated with construction
projects.

Our refineries are integrated with each other via pipelines, terminals and barges to maximize
operating efficiency. The transportation links that connect our refineries allow the movement of crude oil, feedstocks and intermediate products between refineries to optimize operations, produce higher margin products and utilize our processing
capacity efficiently.

We sell gasoline, gasoline blendstocks and No. 1 and No. 2 fuel oils (including kerosene, jet fuel and diesel fuel) to wholesale marketing customers in the Midwest, Gulf Coast and southeastern
regions of the U.S. We sold 54 percent of our gasoline volumes and 88 percent of our distillates volumes on a wholesale or spot market basis in 2010. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in many of our markets, with demand typically being at its
highest levels during the summer months.

We have blended ethanol into gasoline for over 20 years and expanded
our blending program in 2007, in part due to federal regulations that require us to use specified volumes of renewable fuels. Ethanol volumes sold in blended gasoline averaged 68 mbpd in 2010, 60 mbpd in 2009 and 54 mbpd in 2008. The future
expansion or contraction of our ethanol blending program will be driven by the economics of the ethanol supply and by government regulations. We sell reformulated gasoline, which is also blended with ethanol, in parts of our marketing territory,
including: Chicago, Illinois; Louisville, Kentucky; northern Kentucky; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We also sell biodiesel-blended diesel in Illinois, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

We produce propane at all six of our refineries. Propane is primarily used for home heating and cooking, as a feedstock
within the petrochemical industry, for grain drying and as a fuel for trucks and other vehicles. Our propane sales are typically split evenly between the home heating market and industrial consumers.

We are a producer and marketer of petrochemicals and specialty products. Product availability varies by refinery and
includes benzene, cumene, dilute naphthalene oil, molten sulfur, propylene, toluene and xylene. We market propylene, cumene and sulfur domestically to customers in the chemical industry. We also have the capacity to produce 1,400 tons per day of
anode grade coke at our Robinson refinery, which is used to make carbon anodes for the aluminum smelting industry, and 5,600 tons per day of fuel grade coke at the Garyville refinery, which is used for power generation and in miscellaneous
industrial applications.

We produce and market heavy residual fuel oil or related components at all six of our
refineries. Heavy residual fuel oil is primarily used in the utility and ship bunkering (fuel) industries, though there are other more specialized uses of the product.

We have refinery based asphalt production capacity of up to 92 mbpd. We market asphalt through 33 owned or leased
terminals throughout the Midwest and Southeast. We have a broad customer base, including approximately 641 asphalt-paving contractors, government entities (states, counties, cities and townships) and asphalt roofing shingle manufacturers. We sell
asphalt in the wholesale and cargo markets via rail and barge. We also produce asphalt cements, polymer modified asphalt, emulsified asphalt and industrial asphalts.

We hold a 35 percent interest in an entity which owns and operates a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production
facility in Clymers, Indiana. We also own a 50 percent interest in an entity which owns a 110-million-gallon-per-year ethanol production facility in Greenville, Ohio. Both of these facilities are managed by a co-owner.

Pipeline transportation –We own a system of pipelines through Marathon Pipe Line LLC (“MPL”) and
Ohio River Pipe Line LLC (“ORPL”), our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Our pipeline systems transport crude oil and refined products primarily in the Midwest and Gulf Coast regions to our refineries, our terminals and other pipeline systems.
Our MPL







Index to Financial Statements

and ORPL wholly-owned and undivided interest common carrier systems consist of 1,707 miles of crude oil lines and 1,825 miles of refined product lines comprising 31 systems located in 11 states.
The MPL common carrier pipeline network is one of the largest petroleum pipeline systems in the U.S., based on total barrels delivered. Our common carrier pipeline systems are subject to state and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations and
guidelines, including published tariffs for the transportation of crude oil and refined products. Third parties generated 11 percent of the crude oil and refined product shipments on our MPL and ORPL common carrier pipelines in 2010. Our MPL and
ORPL common carrier pipelines transported the volumes shown in the following table for each of the last three years.

We also own 175 miles of private crude oil pipelines and 846 miles of private refined products pipelines, and we lease 217 miles of common carrier refined product pipelines. We have partial ownership
interests in several pipeline companies that have approximately 110 miles of crude oil pipelines and 3,600 miles of refined products pipelines, including about 970 miles operated by MPL. In addition, MPL operates most of our private pipelines and
985 miles of crude oil and 160 miles of natural gas pipelines owned by our E&P segment.

Our major refined
product pipelines include the owned and operated Cardinal Products Pipeline and the Wabash Pipeline. The Cardinal Products Pipeline delivers refined products from Kenova, West Virginia, to Columbus, Ohio. The Wabash Pipeline system delivers product
from Robinson, Illinois, to various terminals in the area of Chicago, Illinois. Other significant refined product pipelines owned and operated by MPL extend from: Robinson, Illinois, to Louisville, Kentucky; Garyville, Louisiana, to Zachary,
Louisiana; and Texas City, Texas, to Pasadena, Texas.

In addition, as of December 31, 2010, we had
interests in the following refined product pipelines:



•65 percent undivided ownership interest in the Louisville-Lexington system, a petroleum products pipeline system extending from Louisville to
Lexington, Kentucky;



•60 percent interest in Muskegon Pipeline LLC, which owns a refined products pipeline extending from Griffith, Indiana, to North Muskegon, Michigan;



•50 percent interest in Centennial Pipeline LLC, which owns a refined products system connecting the Gulf Coast region with the Midwest market;



•17 percent interest in Explorer Pipeline Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from the Gulf Coast to the Midwest; and



•6 percent interest in Wolverine Pipe Line Company, a refined products pipeline system extending from Chicago, Illinois, to Toledo, Ohio.

Our major owned and operated crude oil lines run from: Patoka, Illinois, to Catlettsburg,
Kentucky; Patoka, Illinois, to Robinson, Illinois; Patoka, Illinois, to Lima, Ohio; Lima, Ohio to Canton, Ohio; Samaria, Michigan, to Detroit, Michigan; and St. James, Louisiana, to Garyville, Louisiana.

As of December 31, 2010, we had interests in the following crude oil pipelines:



•51 percent interest in LOOP LLC, the owner and operator of LOOP, which is the only U.S. deepwater oil port, located 18 miles off the coast of
Louisiana, and a crude oil pipeline connecting the port facility to storage caverns and tanks at Clovelly, Louisiana;



•59 percent interest in LOCAP LLC, which owns a crude oil pipeline connecting LOOP and the Capline system;



•33 percent undivided joint interest in the Capline system, a large-diameter crude oil pipeline extending from St. James, Louisiana, to Patoka,
Illinois;



•26 percent undivided joint interest in the Maumee Pipeline System, a large diameter crude oil pipeline extending from Lima, Ohio, to Samaria,
Michigan.

We plan to construct, by the end of 2012, a new section of pipeline connecting an
existing pipeline to our Detroit refinery which will allow us to deliver additional supplies of Canadian crude.

The above discussion contains forward looking statements with respect to the plans to construct a new section of
pipeline. Factors which could affect these plans include transportation logistics, availability of materials and labor, unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions, delays in obtaining or conditions imposed by necessary government and third-party
approvals, and other risks customarily associated with construction projects.

Retail Marketing

Speedway, our wholly-owned subsidiary headquartered in Enon, Ohio, sells gasoline and merchandise
through owned and operated retail outlets primarily under the Speedway®brand. Diesel fuel is also sold at a
number of these outlets. Speedway retail outlets offer a wide variety of merchandise, such as prepared foods, beverages, and non-food items, as well as a significant number of proprietary items. For eleven consecutive quarters ending
September 30, 2010, Speedway has been rated as the best convenience store chain in terms of overall customer satisfaction in a national consumer perception survey conducted by Corporate Research International®. In 2010, Harris Interactive’s EquiTrend®annual brand equity study named
Speedway®the number one gasoline brand with consumers for the second year in a row. Speedway’s Speedy
Rewards™, an industry-leading customer loyalty program, has built active membership to 3.5 million customers.

As of December 31, 2010, Speedway had 1,358 retail outlets in seven states. Sales of refined products through these retail outlets accounted for 13 percent of our refined product sales volumes in
2010 and provide us with a base of ratable sales. Revenues from sales of non-petroleum merchandise through these retail outlets totaled $3,195 million in 2010, $3,109 million in 2009 and $2,838 million in 2008. The demand for gasoline is seasonal in
a majority of Speedway markets, with the highest demand usually occurring during the summer driving season. Margins from the sale of merchandise and services tend to be less volatile than margins from the retail sale of gasoline and diesel fuel.

Competition and Market Conditions

Strong competition exists in all sectors of the oil and gas industry and, in particular, in the exploration for and development of new reserves. We compete with major integrated and independent oil and
gas companies, as well as national oil companies, for the acquisition of oil and natural gas leases and other properties. We compete with these companies for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties and in the
marketing of oil and natural gas to end-users. Many of our competitors have financial and other resources greater than those available to us. Acquiring exploration opportunities frequently requires competitive bids involving front-end bonus payments
or commitments-to-work programs. We also compete in attracting and retaining personnel, including geologists, geophysicists and other specialists. Based upon statistics compiled in the “2010 Global Upstream Performance Review” published by
IHS Herold Inc., we rank ninth among U.S.-based petroleum companies on the basis of 2009 worldwide liquid hydrocarbon and natural gas production.

We also compete with other producers of synthetic and conventional crude oil for the sale of our synthetic crude oil to refineries primarily in North America. Additional synthetic crude oil projects are
being contemplated by various competitors and, if undertaken and completed, these projects may result in a significant increase in the supply of synthetic crude oil to the market. Since not all refineries are able to process or refine synthetic
crude oil in significant volumes, there can be no assurance that sufficient market demand will exist at all times to absorb our share of the synthetic crude oil production from the AOSP at economically viable prices.

Our
operating results are affected by price changes in conventional and synthetic crude oil, natural gas and petroleum products, as well as changes in competitive conditions in the markets we serve. Generally, results from production and oil sands
mining operations benefit from higher crude oil prices while the refining and wholesale marketing gross margin may be adversely affected by crude oil price increases. Price differentials between sweet and sour crude oil also affect operating
results. Market conditions in the oil and gas industry are cyclical and subject to global economic and political events and new and changing governmental regulations.

Environmental Matters

The Public Policy Committee of our Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing our position on public issues, including environmental matters. Our Corporate Health, Environment, Safety and Security
organization has the responsibility to ensure that our operating organizations maintain environmental compliance systems that support and foster our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Committees comprised of certain of our officers
review our overall performance associated with various environmental compliance programs. We also have a Crisis Management Team which oversees our response to any major environmental or other emergency incident involving us or any of our properties.

State, national and international legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are being proposed and, in
some cases, promulgated. This legislation applies or could apply in countries in which we operate. Potential legislation and regulations pertaining to climate change could also affect our operations. The cost to comply with these laws and
regulations cannot be estimated at this time, but could be significant. For additional information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. As part of our commitment to environmental stewardship, we estimate and publicly report greenhouse gas emissions from
our operations. We are working to continuously improve the accuracy and completeness of these estimates. In addition, we continuously strive to improve operational and energy efficiencies through resource and energy conservation where practicable
and cost effective.

For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of
compliance for air, water, solid waste and remediation, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Management’s Discussion and Analysis
of Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies.

Air

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) is in the process of implementing regulations to address the
National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for fine particulate emissions and ozone. In connection with these standards, the EPA will designate certain areas as “nonattainment,” meaning that the air quality in such areas
does not meet the NAAQS. The proposed rule is directed at electric generating units, not refineries, and is expected to be finalized in 2011. However, we cannot reasonably estimate any final financial impact of the state actions to implement the
CATR until the EPA has issued a final rule and states have taken further action to implement that rule.

The
EPA is reviewing and is proposing to revise, all NAAQS for criteria air pollutants. In January, 2010, the EPA issued the final nitrogen dioxide standard. In addition, in June 2010, the EPA published the final standard for sulfur dioxide. In December
2010, the EPA announced that the final ozone rule will be completed by July 29, 2011. We cannot reasonably estimate the final financial impact of these revised NAAQS standards until the implementing rules are established and judicial challenges
over the revised NAAQS standards are resolved.

Water

We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of
the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance efforts. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which amended the CWA. Among other requirements, OPA-90 requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an
emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. Also, in case of any such release, OPA-90 requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages. OPA-90 also provides for civil penalties and imposes
criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions.







Index to Financial Statements

Additionally, OPA-90 requires that new tank vessels entering or operating in
U.S. waters be double-hulled and that existing tank vessels that are not double-hulled be retrofitted or removed from U.S. service, according to a phase-out schedule. All of the barges used for river transport of our raw materials and refined
products meet the double-hulled requirements of OPA-90. We operate facilities at which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability
provisions, including provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90, and we have established
Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures (“SPCC”) plans for facilities subject to CWA SPCC requirements.

Solid Waste

We continue to seek methods to minimize the generation of hazardous wastes in our operations. The
RCRA establishes standards for the management of solid and hazardous wastes. Besides affecting waste disposal practices, RCRA also addresses the environmental effects of certain past waste disposal operations, the recycling of wastes and the
regulation of underground storage tanks (“USTs”) containing regulated substances. We have ongoing RCRA treatment and disposal operations at one of our RM&T facilities and primarily utilize offsite third-party treatment and disposal
facilities.

Remediation

We own or operate certain retail outlets where, during the normal course of operations, releases of refined products from USTs have occurred. Federal and state laws require that contamination caused by
such releases at these sites be assessed and remediated to meet applicable standards. The enforcement of the UST regulations under RCRA has been delegated to the states, which administer their own UST programs. Our obligation to remediate such
contamination varies, depending on the extent of the releases and the stringency of the laws and regulations of the states in which we operate. A portion of these remediation costs may be recoverable from the appropriate state UST reimbursement
funds once the applicable deductibles have been satisfied. We also have other facilities which are subject to remediation under federal or state law. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings – Environmental Proceedings – Other Proceedings for a
discussion of these sites.

The AOSP operations use established processes to mine deposits of bitumen from an
open-pit mine, extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils. Tailings are waste products created from the oil sands extraction process which are placed in ponds. The AOSP is required to reclaim its tailing ponds as part of
its ongoing reclamation work. The reclamation process uses developing technology and there is an inherent risk that the current process may not be as effective or perform as required in order to meet the approved closure and reclamation plan. The
AOSP continues to develop its current reclamation technology and continues to investigate other alternate tailings management technologies. In February 2009, the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board (“ERCB”) issued a directive
which more clearly defines criteria for managing oil sands tailings. The AOSP Joint Venture Operator submitted tailings management papers to the ERCB (for both mines), that sets forth plans to comply with the Directive and received approval
(with conditions) in the second half of 2010. Further new regulations or failure to comply (in a timely manner) could result in additional cost to us.

Other Matters







Index to Financial Statements

On October 13, 2010, the EPA issued a partial waiver decision under the
CAA to allow for an increase in the amount of ethanol permitted to be blended into gasoline from 10 percent (“E10”) to 15 percent (“E15”) for 2007 and newer light-duty motor vehicles. There are numerous state and federal
regulatory issues that would need to be addressed before E15 can be marketed for use in any traditional gasoline engines.

The USX Separation

On December 31, 2001, pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization dated as of July 31,
2001, Marathon completed the USX Separation, in which:



•its wholly-owned subsidiary United States Steel LLC converted into a Delaware corporation named United States Steel Corporation and became a
separate, publicly traded company; and



•USX Corporation changed its name to Marathon Oil Corporation.

As a result of the USX Separation, Marathon and United States Steel are separate companies and neither has any ownership
interest in the other.

In connection with the USX Separation and pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization,
Marathon and United States Steel have entered into a series of agreements governing their relationship after the USX Separation and providing for the allocation of tax and certain other liabilities and obligations arising from periods before the USX
Separation. The following is a description of the material terms of one of those agreements.

Financial Matters Agreement

Under the financial matters agreement, United States Steel has assumed and agreed to discharge all of
our principal repayment, interest payment and other obligations under the following, including any amounts due on any default or acceleration of any of those obligations, other than any default caused by us:



•obligations under industrial revenue bonds related to environmental projects for current and former U.S. Steel Group facilities, with maturities
ranging from 2011 through 2033;



•sale-leaseback financing obligations under a lease for equipment at United States Steel’s Fairfield Works facility, with a lease term to 2012,
subject to extensions;



•obligations relating to various lease arrangements accounted for as operating leases and various guarantee arrangements, all of which were assumed
by United States Steel; and



•certain other guarantees.

The financial matters agreement also provides that, on or before December 31, 2011, United States Steel will provide for our discharge from any remaining liability under any of the assumed industrial
revenue bonds. United States Steel may accomplish that discharge by refinancing or, to the extent not refinanced, paying us an amount equal to the remaining principal amount of all accrued and unpaid debt service outstanding on, and any premium
required to immediately retire, the then outstanding industrial revenue bonds.

Under the financial matters
agreement, United States Steel has all of the existing contractual rights under the leases assumed from us, including all rights related to purchase options, prepayments or the grant or release of security interests. However, United States Steel has
no right to increase amounts due under or lengthen the term of any of the assumed lease obligations without our prior consent other than extensions set forth in the terms of the assumed leases.

The financial matters agreement requires us to use commercially reasonable efforts to assure compliance with all
covenants and other obligations to avoid the occurrence of a default or the acceleration of the payments on the assumed obligations.

United States Steel’s obligations to us under the financial matters agreement are general unsecured obligations that rank equal to United States Steel’s accounts payable and other general
unsecured obligations. The financial matters agreement does not contain any financial covenants and United States Steel is free to incur additional debt, grant mortgages on or security interests in its property and sell or transfer assets without
our consent.

Concentrations of Credit Risk

We are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonpayment by counterparties, a significant portion of which are concentrated in energy-related industries. The creditworthiness of customers and other
counterparties is subject to continuing review, including the use of master netting agreements, where appropriate. While no single customer accounts for more than 10 percent of annual revenues, we have exposures to United States Steel arising from
the transaction discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.

Trademarks, Patents and Licenses

We currently hold a number of U.S. and foreign patents and have various pending patent applications. Although in the
aggregate our trademarks, patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single trademark, patent, license or group of related trademarks, patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole.

Employees

We had
29,677 active employees as of December 31, 2010. Of that number, 19,147 were employees of Speedway, most of whom were employed at our retail marketing outlets.

Certain hourly employees at our Catlettsburg and Canton refineries are represented by the United Steel, Paper and
Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers Union under labor agreements that expire on January 31, 2012. Certain employees at our Texas City refinery are represented by the same union under a labor agreement
that expires on March 31, 2012.

The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents certain hourly
employees at our Detroit refinery under a labor agreement that is scheduled to expire on January 31, 2014. They also represent employees at the St. Paul Park refinery under a labor agreement that is scheduled to expire on May 31, 2012. The
St. Paul Park Refinery was sold effective December 1, 2010, however there is a transition services agreement in place. Due to this agreement, we remain subject to the labor contracts until the employee transfer date. See Item 8. Financial
Statements and Supplementary Data—Note 6 for transaction details.
