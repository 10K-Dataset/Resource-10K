Item 1. Business.

Overview

Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. and its subsidiaries, collectively referred to
herein as we, our, us or Gallagher, are engaged in providing insurance brokerage and third-party claims settlement and administration services to entities in the United States (U.S.) and abroad. We believe that our major strength is our ability to
deliver comprehensively structured insurance and risk management services to our clients. Our brokers, agents and administrators act as intermediaries between insurers and their customers and we do not assume underwriting risks.

Since our founding in 1927, we have grown from a one-man agency to the world’s fourth largest insurance broker based on revenues, according toBusiness Insurancemagazine’s July 16, 2012 edition, and the world’s largest property/casualty third-party claims administrator, according toBusiness Insurancemagazine’s August 13, 2012 edition. We generate
approximately 80% of our revenues domestically, with the remaining 20% derived primarily from operations in Australia, Bermuda, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom (U.K.).

Shares of our common stock are traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol AJG, and we had a market capitalization at December 31, 2012 of approximately $4.4 billion. Information in this
report is as of December 31, 2012 unless otherwise noted. We were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1972. Our executive offices are located at Two Pierce Place, Itasca, Illinois 60143-3141, and our telephone number is
(630) 773-3800.

We have three reporting segments: brokerage, risk management and corporate, which contributed approximately 73%, 22% and
5%, respectively, to 2012 revenues.

Operating Segments

We report our results in three segments: brokerage, risk management and
corporate. The major sources of our operating revenues are commissions, fees and supplemental and contingent commissions from brokerage operations and fees from risk management operations. Information with respect to all sources of revenue, by
segment, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, is as follows (in millions):

See Note 17 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information, including earnings from
continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets by segment for 2012, 2011 and 2010.







Our business, particularly our brokerage business, is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Commission and fee
revenues, and the related brokerage and marketing expenses, can vary from quarter to quarter as a result of the timing of policy inception dates and the timing of receipt of information from insurance carriers. On the other the hand, salaries and
employee benefits, rent, depreciation and amortization expenses generally tend to be more uniform throughout the year. The timing of acquisitions and recognition of investment gains and losses also impact the trends in our quarterly operating
results. See Note 16 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements for unaudited quarterly operating results for 2012 and 2011.

Brokerage Segment

The brokerage segment
accounted for 73% of our revenues in 2012. Our brokerage segment is primarily comprised of retail and wholesale insurance brokerage operations. Our retail brokerage operations negotiate and place property/casualty, employer-provided health and
welfare insurance, and healthcare exchange and retirement solutions principally for middle-market commercial, industrial, public entity, religious and not-for-profit entities. Many of our retail brokerage customers choose to place their insurance
with insurance underwriters, while others choose to use alternative vehicles such as self-insurance pools, risk retention groups or captive insurance companies. Our wholesale brokerage operations assist our brokers and other unaffiliated brokers and
agents in the placement of specialized, unique and hard-to-place insurance programs.

Our primary sources of compensation for our retail
brokerage services are commissions paid by insurance carriers, which are usually based upon either a percentage of the premium paid by insureds or brokerage and advisory fees paid directly by our clients. For wholesale brokerage services, we
generally receive a share of the commission paid to the retail broker by the insurer. Commission rates depend on a number of factors, including the type of insurance, the particular insurance company underwriting the policy and whether we act as a
retail or wholesale broker. Advisory fees paid to us by our clients depend on the extent and value of the services we provide. In addition, under certain circumstances, we receive supplemental and contingent commissions for both retail and wholesale
brokerage services. A supplemental commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier that is above the base commission paid. The insurance carrier determines the supplemental commission that is eligible to be paid annually based on historical
performance criteria in advance of the contractual period. A contingent commission is a commission paid by an insurance carrier based on the overall profit and/or the overall volume of business placed with that insurance carrier during a particular
calendar year and is determined after the contractual period.

We operate our brokerage operations through a network of approximately 350
sales and service offices located throughout the U.S. and in 17 other countries. Most of these offices are fully staffed with sales and service personnel. In addition, we offer client-service capabilities in more than 140 countries around the world
through a network of correspondent brokers and consultants.

Retail Insurance Brokerage Operations

Our retail insurance brokerage operations accounted for 76% of our brokerage segment revenues in 2012. Our retail brokerage operations place nearly all
lines of commercial property/casualty and health and welfare insurance coverage. Significant lines of insurance coverage and consultant capabilities are as follows:



401(k) SolutionsDentalFireProducts Liability403(b) SolutionsDirectors & Officers LiabilityGeneral LiabilityProfessional LiabilityAviationDisabilityLifePropertyCasualtyEarthquakeMarineWindCommercial AutoErrors & OmissionsMedicalWorkers Compensation

Our retail brokerage operations are organized in more than 300 geographical profit centers primarily located in the U.S.,
Australia, Canada and U.K. and operate within certain key niche/practice groups, which account for approximately 61% of our retail brokerage revenues. These specialized teams target areas of business and/or industries in which we have developed a
depth of expertise and a large client base. Significant niche/practice groups we serve are as follows:



AgribusinessExecutive BenefitsInternational BenefitsReligious/Not-for-ProfitAutomotiveGlobal RisksMarineRestaurantAviation & AerospaceHealth and WelfareManufacturingRetirementCaptive ConsultingHealthcarePersonalScholasticConstructionHealthcare AnalyticsPrivate EquityTechnology/TelecomEnergyHigher EducationProfessional GroupsTransportationEntertainmentHospitalityPublic EntityVoluntary BenefitsEnvironmentalHuman ResourcesReal Estate

Our specialized focus on these niche/practice groups allows for highly-focused marketing efforts and facilitates the
development of value-added products and services specific to those industries or business segments. We believe that our detailed understanding and broad client contacts within these niche/practice groups provide us with a competitive advantage.







We anticipate that our retail brokerage operations’ greatest revenue growth over the next several years
will continue to come from:



•Mergers and acquisitions;



•Our niche/practice groups and middle-market accounts;



•Cross-selling other brokerage products to existing customers; and



•Developing and managing alternative market mechanisms such as captives, rent-a-captives and deductible plans/self-insurance.

Wholesale Insurance Brokerage Operations

Our wholesale insurance brokerage operations accounted for 24% of our brokerage segment revenues in 2012. Our wholesale brokers assist our retail brokers and other non-affiliated brokers in the placement
of specialized and hard-to-place insurance. These brokers operate through more than 65 geographical profit centers located across the U.S., Bermuda and through our approved Lloyd’s of London brokerage operation. In certain cases, we act as a
brokerage wholesaler and, in other cases, we act as a managing general agent or managing general underwriter distributing specialized insurance coverages for insurance carriers. Managing general agents and managing general underwriters are agents
authorized by an insurance company to manage all or a part of the insurer’s business in a specific geographic territory. Activities they perform on behalf of the insurer may include marketing, underwriting (although we do not assume any
underwriting risk), issuing policies, collecting premiums, appointing and supervising other agents, paying claims and negotiating reinsurance.

More than 75% of our wholesale brokerage revenues come from non-affiliated brokerage customers. Based on revenues, our domestic wholesale brokerage
operation ranked as the largest domestic managing general agent/underwriting manager according toBusiness Insurancemagazine’s October 8, 2012 edition.

We anticipate growing our wholesale brokerage operations by increasing the number of broker-clients, developing new managing general agency and underwriter programs, and through mergers and acquisitions.

Risk Management Segment

Our
risk management segment accounted for 22% of our revenues in 2012. Our risk management segment provides contract claim settlement and administration services for enterprises that choose to self-insure some or all of their property/casualty coverages
and for insurance companies that choose to outsource some or all of their property/casualty claims departments. Approximately 68% of our risk management segment’s revenues are from workers compensation related claims, 27% are from general and
commercial auto liability related claims and 5% are from property related claims. In addition, we generate revenues from integrated disability management (employee absence management) programs, information services, risk control consulting (loss
control) services and appraisal services, either individually or in combination with arising claims. Revenues for risk management services are comprised of fees generally negotiated in advance on a per-claim or per-service basis, depending upon the
type and estimated volume of the services to be performed.

Risk management services are primarily marketed directly to Fortune 1000
companies, larger middle-market companies, not-for-profit organizations and public entities on an independent basis from our brokerage operations. We manage our third-party claims adjusting operations through a network of approximately 110 offices
located throughout the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. Most of these offices are fully staffed with claims adjusters and other service personnel. Our adjusters and service personnel act solely on behalf and under the instruction of
our clients and customers.

While this segment complements our insurance brokerage offerings, more than 88% of our risk management
segment’s revenues come from non-affiliated brokerage customers, such as insurance companies and clients of other insurance brokers. Based on revenues, our risk management operation ranked as the world’s largest property/casualty third
party claims administrator according toBusiness Insurancemagazine’s August 13, 2012 edition.

We expect that the risk
management segment’s most significant growth prospects through the next several years will come from increased levels of business with Fortune 1000 companies, larger middle-market companies, captives, program business and the outsourcing of
insurance company claims departments. In addition, the risk management segment may grow in the future through mergers and acquisitions.







Corporate Segment

The corporate segment accounted for 5% of our revenues in 2012. The corporate segment reports the financial information related to our debt, clean energy investments, external acquisition-related expenses
and other corporate costs. The revenues reported by this segment in 2012 resulted primarily from our consolidation of refined fuel operations that we control and own more than 50% of and from leased facilities we operate and control. At
December 31, 2012, significant investments managed by this segment include:

Clean Coal Related Ventures

We have a 46.54% interest in a privately-held enterprise (Chem-Mod LLC) that has commercialized multi-pollutant reduction technologies to reduce mercury,
sulfur dioxide and other emissions at coal-fired power plants. We also have an 8.0% interest in a privately-held start-up enterprise (C-Quest Technology LLC), which owns technologies that reduce carbon dioxide emissions created by burning fossil
fuels.

Tax-Advantaged Investments

Prior to January 1, 2008, we owned certain partnerships formed to develop energy that qualified for tax credits under the former IRC Section 29. These consisted of waste-to-energy and synthetic
coal operations. These investments helped to substantially reduce our effective income tax rate from 2002 through 2007. The law that permitted us to claim IRC Section 29 tax credits expired on December 31, 2007. In 2009 and 2011, we built
a total of 29 commercial clean coal production plants to produce refined coal using Chem-Mod’s proprietary technologies. We believe these operations produce refined coal that will qualify for tax credits under IRC Section 45. The law that
provides for IRC Section 45 tax credits substantially expires in December 2019 for the fourteen plants we built and placed in service in 2009 (2009 Era Plants) and in December 2021 for the fifteen plants we built and placed in service in 2011
(2011 Era Plants).

International Operations

Our total revenues by geographic area for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 were as follows (in millions):



201220112010Amount% ofTotalAmount% ofTotalAmount% ofTotalUnited States$2,006.180%$1,725.181%$1,613.587%United Kingdom352.314%260.512%148.88%Other foreign, principally Australia, Bermuda and Canada161.96%149.17%101.95%Total revenues$2,520.3100%$2,134.7100%$1,864.2100%

See Notes 5, 14 and 17 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements for additional financial information related to our
foreign operations, including goodwill allocation, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and identifiable assets, by segment, for 2012, 2011 and 2010.

Brokerage Operations in Australia, Bermuda, Canada and the U.K.

The majority of our
international brokerage operations are in Australia, Bermuda, Canada and the U.K.

We operate in Australia and Canada primarily as a retail
commercial property and casualty broker. In the U.K., we also have a retail brokerage and underwriting operation for clients to access the Lloyd’s of London and other international insurance markets, and a program operation offering customized
risk management products and services to U.K. public entities. In Bermuda, we act principally as a wholesaler for clients looking to access the Bermuda insurance markets and also provide services relating to the formation and management of offshore
captive insurance companies.

We also have ownership interests in two Bermuda-based insurance companies and a Guernsey-based insurance company
that operate segregated account “rent-a-captive” facilities. These facilities enable clients to receive the benefits of owning a captive insurance company without incurring certain disadvantages of ownership. Captive insurance companies
are created for clients to insure their risks and capture underwriting profit and investment income, which is then available for use by the insureds generally for reducing future costs of their insurance programs.

We also have strategic brokerage alliances with a variety of international brokers in countries where we do not have a local office presence. Through a
network of correspondent insurance brokers and consultants in more than 140 countries, we are able to fully serve our clients’ coverage and service needs in virtually any geographic area.

Risk Management Operations in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K.

Our international risk management operations are principally in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. Services are similar to those provided in the U.S. and are provided primarily on behalf of
commercial and public entity clients.







Markets and Marketing

We manage our brokerage operations through a network of approximately 350 sales and service offices located throughout the U.S. and in 17 other countries. We manage our third-party claims adjusting
operations through a network of approximately 110 offices located throughout the U.S., Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the U.K. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial, public entity, religious and
not-for-profit entities. No material part of our business depends upon a single customer or on a few customers. The loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our operations. In 2012, our largest single customer accounted
for approximately 2% of total revenues and our ten largest customers represented 5% of total revenues in the aggregate. Our revenues are geographically diversified, with both domestic and international operations.

Each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has a small market-share position and, as a result, we believe has substantial organic growth
potential. In addition, each of our retail and wholesale brokerage operations has the ability to grow through the acquisition of small- to medium-sized independent brokerages. See “Business Combinations” below.

While historically we have generally grown our risk management segment organically, and we expect to continue to do so, from time to time we consider
acquisitions for this segment.

We require our employees serving in sales or marketing capacities, including all of our executive officers, to
enter into agreements with us restricting disclosure of confidential information and solicitation of our clients and prospects upon their termination of employment. The confidentiality and non-solicitation provisions of such agreements terminate in
the event of a hostile change in control, as defined in the agreements.

Competition

Brokerage Segment

According toBusiness Insurancemagazine’s July 16, 2012 edition, we were the fourth largest insurance broker worldwide based on total revenues. The insurance brokerage and service business is highly competitive and there are many insurance
brokerage and service organizations and individuals throughout the world who actively compete with us in every area of our business.

Our
retail and wholesale brokerage operations compete with Aon plc, Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc. and Willis Group Holdings, Ltd., each of which has greater worldwide revenues than us. In addition, various other competing firms, such as
Wells Fargo Insurance Services, Inc., Brown & Brown Inc., Hub International Ltd., Lockton Companies, Inc. and USI Holdings Corporation, operate nationally or are strong in a particular region or locality and may have, in that region or
locality, an office with revenues as large as or larger than those of our corresponding local office. We believe that the primary factors determining our competitive position with other organizations in our industry are the quality of the services
we render and the overall costs to our clients. In addition, for health/welfare products and benefit consultant services, we compete with larger firms such as Aon Hewitt, Mercer (a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc.),
Towers Watson & Co. and the benefits consulting divisions of the national public accounting firms, as well as a vast number of local and regional brokerages and agencies.

Our wholesale brokerage operations compete with large wholesalers such as CRC Insurance Services, Inc., RT Specialty, AmWINS Group, Inc., Swett & Crawford Group, Inc., as well as a vast number of
local and regional wholesalers.

We also compete with certain insurance companies that write insurance directly for their customers.
Government benefits relating to health, disability, and retirement are also alternatives to private insurance and indirectly compete with us.

Risk Management Segment

Our risk
management operation currently ranks as the world’s largest property/casualty third party administrator based on revenues, according toBusiness Insurancemagazine’s August 13, 2012 edition. While many global and regional
claims administrators operate within this space, we compete directly with Sedgwick Claims Management Services, Inc., Broadspire Services, Inc. (a subsidiary of Crawford & Company) and ESIS (a subsidiary of ACE Limited). Several large
insurance companies, such as AIG Insurance and Zurich Insurance, also maintain their own claims administration units, which can be strong competitors. In addition, we compete with various smaller third party administrators on a regional level. We
believe that our competitive position is due to our strong reputation for outstanding service and our ability to resolve customers’ losses in the most cost-efficient manner possible.

Regulation

We are required to be licensed or receive regulatory approval in nearly every
state and foreign jurisdiction in which we do business. In addition, most jurisdictions require that individuals who engage in brokerage, claim adjusting and certain other insurance service activities be personally licensed. These licensing laws and
regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In most jurisdictions, licensing laws and regulations generally grant broad discretion to supervisory authorities to adopt and amend regulations and to supervise regulated activities.







Business Combinations

We completed and integrated 248 acquisitions from January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2012, almost exclusively within our brokerage segment. The majority of these acquisitions have been smaller
regional or local property/casualty retail or wholesale operations with a strong middle-market client focus or significant expertise in one of our focus market areas. Over the last decade, we have also increased our acquisition activity in the
retail employee benefits brokerage and wholesale brokerage areas. The total purchase price for individual acquisitions have typically ranged from $1 million to $50 million.

Through acquisitions, we seek to expand our talent pool, enhance our geographic presence and service capabilities, and/or broaden and further diversify our business mix. We also focus on identifying:



•A corporate culture that matches our sales-oriented culture;



•A profitable, growing business whose ability to compete would be enhanced by gaining access to our greater resources; and



•Clearly defined financial criteria.

See Note 3 to our 2012 consolidated financial statements for a summary of our 2012 acquisitions, the amount and form of the consideration paid and the dates of acquisition.

Employees

As of December 31, 2012,
we had approximately 13,700 employees. We continuously review benefits and other matters of interest to our employees and consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
