Marketed Products

AVONEX

AVONEX is one of the most prescribed treatments for relapsing forms of MS worldwide. MS is a progressive neurological disease in which the body loses the ability to transmit messages along nerve cells, leading to a loss of muscle control, paralysis and, in some cases, death. Patients with active relapsing MS experience an uneven pattern of disease progression characterized by periods of stability that are interrupted by flare-ups of the disease after which the patient returns to a new baseline of functioning. AVONEX is a recombinant form of the interferon beta protein produced in the body in response to viral infection.

2012Developments

•In February 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved two separate dosing innovations designed to improve the treatment experience for patients receiving once-a-week AVONEX for relapsing forms of MS:  AVONEX PEN and a new dose titration regimen.  AVONEX PEN is the first intramuscular autoinjector approved for MS and is designed to enhance the self-injection process for patients receiving AVONEX therapy.  A new dose titration regimen, facilitated by the AVOSTARTGRIP titration devices, provides patients with the option to gradually increase the dose of AVONEX at treatment initiation to reduce the incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms that patients may experience with therapy.  These AVONEX dosing innovations are commercially available in the E.U., U.S. and other countries.

TYSABRI

TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its established efficacy. TYSABRI is a monoclonal antibody approved in numerous countries as a monotherapy for relapsing MS and is also approved in the U.S. to treat Crohn's disease, an inflammatory disease of the intestines.

TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), an opportunistic infection of the brain by the JC virus that usually leads to death or severe disability. Infection by the JC virus (JCV) is required for the development of PML and patients who are anti-JCV antibody positive have a higher risk of developing PML.  Factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. Reports of cases of PML in patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies led us to voluntarily suspend the marketing and commercial distribution of TYSABRI in February 2005 until its reintroduction to the market in July 2006. Because of the risk of PML, TYSABRI has a boxed warning and is marketed under risk management or minimization plans approved by regulatory authorities. In the U.S., for example, TYSABRI is marketed under the TOUCH Prescribing Program, a restricted distribution program designed to assess and minimize the risk of PML, minimize death and disability due to PML, and promote informed benefit-risk decisions regarding TYSABRI use.









U.S. and E.U. regulators continue to monitor and assess on an ongoing basis the criteria for confirming PML diagnosis, the number of PML cases, the incidence of PML in TYSABRI patients, the risk factors for PML, and TYSABRI's benefit-risk profile, which could result in modifications to the approved labels or other restrictions on TYSABRI treatment. We continue to research and develop protocols and therapies that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of PML in patients.

We collaborate with Elan Pharma International, Ltd (Elan) on the development and commercialization of TYSABRI. For information about this collaboration, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

2012- 2013 Developments

•In January 2013, we and Elan Corporation, plc announced the submission of applications to the FDA and European Medicines Agency (EMA) requesting updates to the TYSABRI product labels. The applications request an expanded indication that would include first-line use for people living with certain relapsing forms of MS who have tested negative for antibodies to the JC virus.

•In January 2012, the FDA approved the inclusion in the U.S. product label for TYSABRI of anti-JCV antibody status as an additional factor in stratifying patients for developing PML.  The FDA also approved the inclusion of a table summarizing the estimated incidence of PML according to the duration of TYSABRI treatment, prior immunosuppressant use and anti-JCV antibody status. In addition, the FDA granted Quest Diagnostics a de novo classification petition for the STRATIFY JCV Antibody ELISA testing service, which allows neurologists to determine their MS patients' anti-JCV antibody status.

RITUXAN

RITUXAN is a widely prescribed monoclonal antibody used to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are cancers that affect lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that help to fight infection. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the body's joints, resulting in inflammation, pain and joint damage. ANCA-associated vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disease that largely affects the small blood vessels of the kidneys, lungs, sinuses, and a variety of other organs.

We collaborate with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group, on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN. For information about this collaboration, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

FAMPYRA

FAMPYRA is the first treatment that addresses the unmet medical need of walking improvement in adult patients with MS who have walking disability. FAMPYRA is a prolonged-release tablet formulation of the drug fampridine. FAMPYRA is commercially available throughout the European Union and in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Israel and South Korea, and we anticipate making FAMPYRA commercially available in additional markets in 2013.

We have a license from Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. to develop and commercialize FAMPYRA in all markets outside the U.S. For information about this relationship, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

2012Developments

•The European Commission previously granted a conditional marketing authorization for FAMPYRA in the E.U. in July 2011.  A conditional marketing authorization is renewable annually and is granted to a medicinal product with a positive benefit-risk assessment that fulfills an unmet medical need when the benefit to public health of immediate availability outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.  This marketing authorization was renewed as of July 2012. To meet the conditions of this marketing authorization, we will provide additional data from on-going clinical studies regarding FAMPYRA's benefits and safety in the long term.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis in Germany. Psoriasis is a skin disease in which cells build up on the skin surface and form scales and red patches.









Other Sources of Revenue

Our other sources of revenue consist of royalties we receive from net sales of products related to patents that we licensed (royalty revenues) and revenues from our contract manufacturing, product supply and biosimilar arrangements (corporate partner revenues).  Summary information about our other sources of revenue is set forth in the table below:

(In millions)201220112010Royalty revenues$168.7$158.5$137.4Corporate partner revenues$43.8$57.4$31.7

Our most significant source of royalty revenue is derived from net worldwide sales of ANGIOMAX, which is licensed to The Medicines Company (TMC).  TMC markets ANGIOMAX primarily in the U.S. and Europe for use as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. For a description of this royalty arrangement, please read the subsection entitled “Other Revenues - Royalty Revenues” in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this report.

2012Developments

•In March 2012, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office granted the extension of the term of the principal U.S. patent that covers ANGIOMAX to December 15, 2014.  Under the terms of our royalty arrangement for ANGIOMAX, TMC is obligated to pay us royalties earned, on a country-by-country basis, until the later of (1) twelve years from the date of the first commercial sale of ANGIOMAX in such country or (2) the date upon which the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent in such country. The annual royalty rate is reduced by a specified percentage in any country where the product is no longer covered by a licensed patent and where sales have been reduced to a certain volume-based market share. TMC began selling ANGIOMAX in the U.S. in January 2001.

Research and Development Programs

A commitment to research is fundamental to our mission at Biogen Idec. Our research and development strategy is to discover and develop first-in-class molecules or best-in-class molecules that improve safety or efficacy for unmet medical needs. By applying our expertise in biologics and our growing capabilities in small-molecule drug discovery and development, we target specific medical needs where new or better treatments are needed.

We intend to continue committing significant resources to research and development opportunities and business development activity. As part of our ongoing research and development efforts, we have devoted significant resources to conducting clinical studies to advance the development of new pharmaceutical products and to explore the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their labels. The table below highlights our current research and development programs. Drug development involves a high degree of risk and investment, and the status, timing and scope of our development programs are subject to change. Important factors that could adversely affect our drug development efforts are discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this report.

Late Stage Product Candidates

Additional information about our late stage product candidates is set forth below.

TECFIDERA (BG-12)

In February 2012, we submitted a New Drug Application to the FDA for marketing approval of TECFIDERA, our oral small molecule candidate for the treatment of MS. The regulatory submission was based on TECFIDERA's comprehensive development program, in which TECFIDERA demonstrated significant reductions in MS disease activity coupled with favorable safety and tolerability in the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies.  The FDA accepted our application for TECFIDERA and granted us a standard review timeline.  In October 2012, we announced that the FDA extended the initial PDUFA date for its review of our application by three months, which is a standard extension period. The extended PDUFA target date is in late March 2013. The FDA has indicated that the extension of the PDUFA date is needed to allow additional time for review of our application. The agency has not asked for additional studies.

In March 2012, we submitted a Marketing Authorisation Application for TECFIDERA to the EMA.  The EMA has validated our application for review of TECFIDERA in the E.U.  We have submitted additional regulatory applications for TECFIDERA in Australia, Canada and Switzerland.

We acquired TECFIDERA as part of our acquisition of Fumapharm AG in 2006. For more information about this acquisition and associated milestone obligations, please read the subsection entitled “Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements-Contingent Consideration” in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this report.

Peginterferon beta-1a

Peginterferon beta-1a (Peginterferon) is designed to prolong the effects and reduce the dosing frequency of interferon beta-1a.  The FDA has granted Peginterferon fast track status, which may result in priority review.

In January 2013, we released the primary efficacy analysis and safety data from our Phase 3 study, ADVANCE. Results support Peginterferon as a potential treatment dosed every two weeks or every four weeks for relapsing-remitting MS. The primary endpoint of ADVANCE, annualized relapse rate at one year, was met for both the two-week and four-week dosing regimens. Results showed that Peginterferon also met the secondary endpoints of risk of 12-week confirmed disability progression, proportion of patients who relapsed and magnetic resonance imaging assessments for both dose regimens. We plan to submit marketing applications for Peginterferon in the U.S. and E.U. by mid - 2013.









Daclizumab

Daclizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is being tested in relapsing MS. In May 2010, we began patient enrollment in a Phase 3 study of daclizumab in relapsing MS, known as DECIDE, evaluating the efficacy and safety of daclizumab compared to interferon beta-1a (AVONEX). The DECIDE study is designed to have a two year endpoint and is expected to involve approximately 1,800 patients.

In August 2011, we announced positive results from SELECT, a global, registrational Phase 2b study designed to evaluate daclizumab in relapsing MS over one year. Results showed that daclizumab, administered subcutaneously once every four weeks, met primary and key secondary study endpoints, compared to placebo.

We collaborate with AbbVie Biotherapuetics, Inc., a subsidiary of AbbVie, Inc. on the development and commercialization of daclizumab. For information about this collaboration, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

TYSABRI (SPMS)

As part of our efforts with Elan to identify additional applications for TYSABRI, in September 2011 we began patient enrollment in a Phase 3b study of TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, known as ASCEND. The study is designed to have an endpoint of approximately two years and involve approximately 850 patients.  Secondary progressive MS is characterized by a steady progression of nerve damage, symptoms and disability.

Long-Lasting Recombinant Factors VIII and IX

In October 2012, we announced positive top-line results from the Phase 3 study, known as A-LONG, investigating our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII-Fc fusion protein in hemophilia A, a rare inherited disorder which inhibits blood coagulation.  We plan to submit a Biologics License Application to the FDA for our long-lasting Factor VIII product candidate in the first half of 2013.

We submitted a Biologics License Application to the FDA for marketing approval of our long-lasting recombinant Factor IX-Fc fusion protein in hemophilia B, a rare inherited disorder which inhibits blood coagulation, in the fourth quarter of 2012.  The regulatory submission was based on the positive top-line results from the Phase 3 study known as B-LONG.

Pediatric data will be required as part of the Marketing Authorization Applications for our long-lasting Factor VIII and IX product candidates that we plan to submit to the EMA, and we have initiated two global pediatric studies of our long-lasting Factor VIII and IX product candidates.

We collaborate with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB on the commercialization of long-lasting recombinant Factors VIII and IX. For information about this collaboration, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

GA101

We collaborate with Genentech, Inc., a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group, on the development and commercialization of GA101, a monoclonal antibody. Genentech and Roche are managing the following Phase 3 studies of GA101:

•GOYA: investigating the efficacy and safety of GA101 in combination with CHOP chemotherapy compared to RITUXAN with CHOP chemotherapy in previously untreated patients with CD20-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

•GALLIUM: investigating the efficacy and safety of GA101 in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance with GA101 compared to RITUXAN in combination with chemotherapy followed by maintenance with RITUXAN in previously untreated patients with indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

•GADOLIN: investigating the efficacy and safety of GA101 plus bendamustine compared with bendamustine alone in patients with RITUXAN-refractory, indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

•CLL11: investigating the safety and efficacy of GA101 plus chlorambucil, a chemotherapy, compared to RITUXAN plus chlorambucil or chlorambucil alone in previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients with co-morbidities.









In January 2013, the Roche Group announced that stage 1 of the CLL11 study met its primary endpoint with an improvement in progression-free survival (PFS):  GA101 plus chlorambucil significantly reduced the risk of disease worsening or death compared to chlorambucil alone.  The CLL11 study includes two separate stages. Stage 1 evaluated GA101 plus chlorambucil compared to chlorambucil alone and included a pre-planned PFS futility analysis comparing GA101 plus chlorambucil to RITUXAN plus chlorambucil. The goal of the futility analysis was to evaluate the likelihood that the study would meet its pre-specified endpoint criteria during stage 2 analysis:  improved efficacy (PFS) in the direct comparison of GA101 plus chlorambucil versus RITUXAN plus chlorambucil. The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board assessment concluded that stage 2 of the study should continue until its final analysis.

For information about our collaboration with Genentech, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Former Registrational Program

At the end of December 2012, we learned that a Phase 3 trial investigating dexpramipexole in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) did not meet its primary endpoint, a joint rank analysis of function and survival, and no efficacy was seen in the individual components of function or survival.  The trial also failed to show efficacy in its key secondary endpoints.  Based on these results, we have discontinued development of dexpramipexole in ALS.

Dexpramipexole was being developed pursuant to a license agreement with Knopp Neurosciences, Inc.  For more information about this relationship, please read Note 20,Investments in Variable Interest Entitiesto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Business Development

In December 2012, we entered into an arrangement with Eisai, Inc. to lease a portion of their facility in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (RTP) to manufacture our and Eisai's oral solid dose products and for Eisai to provide us with vial-filling services for biologic therapies and packaging services for oral solid dose products. For additional information about this transaction, please read Note 12,Property, Plant and Equipmentto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

In December, June and January 2012, we entered into three separate exclusive, worldwide option and collaboration agreements with Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Isis) under which both companies will develop and commercialize antisense therapeutics for up to three gene targets, Isis’ product candidates for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) and the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), respectively. For additional information about these transactions, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

In March 2012, we acquired Stromedix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company involved in the discovery of antibodies designed to treat fibrosis disorders.  Stromedix' lead candidate, STX-100, is in a Phase 2 study for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, a disease in which lung tissue becomes scarred over time.  There is no FDA-approved treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at this time. For additional information about this transaction, please read Note 2,Acquisitionsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

In February 2012, we finalized an agreement with Samsung Biologics that established an entity, Samsung Bioepis, to develop, manufacture and market biosimilar pharmaceuticals. For additional information about this transaction, please read Note 21,Collaborative and Other Relationshipsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights

Patents are important to developing and protecting our competitive position. We regularly seek patent protection in the U.S. and in selected countries outside the U.S. for inventions originating from our research and development efforts. In addition, we license rights to various patents and patent applications, generally, in return for the payment of royalties to the patent owner. U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest (priority) application was filed; however, U.S. patents that issue on applications filed before June 8, 1995 may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20 year date. In some cases, the patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review or because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in prosecuting the application. The duration of foreign patents varies similarly, in accordance with local law.

Regulatory data protection also can provide meaningful protection for our products. Regulatory data protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for a set period of time, the exclusive use of the proprietary pre-clinical and clinical data that it compiled at significant cost and submitted to the applicable regulatory authority to obtain approval of its product. After the set period of time, third parties are then permitted to rely upon the data to obtain approval of their abbreviated applications to market generic drugs and biosimilars. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on









trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) requires signatory countries to provide regulatory data protection to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country.

We also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to remain competitive. We protect such information principally through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees, these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment shall be our exclusive property.

Our trademarks, including RITUXAN and AVONEX, are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or registrations in the USPTO and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. We also use trademarks licensed from third parties, such as the mark TYSABRI which we license from Elan. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and continues in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as the mark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.

A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and proprietary rights is set forth in the “Risk Factors” section of this report.

Additional information about the patents and other proprietary rights covering our marketed products and several of our late-stage product candidates is set forth below.

AVONEX and Pegylated Beta Interferon

Our U.S. patent No. 7,588,755, granted in September 2009, claims the use of recombinant beta interferon for immunomodulation or treating a viral condition, viral disease, cancers or tumors. This patent, which expires in September 2026, covers, among other things, the treatment of MS with our product AVONEX, as well as the treatment of MS with pegylated beta interferon. A discussion of legal proceedings related to this patent is set forth in Note 22,Litigationto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

We have non-exclusive rights under certain third-party patents and patent applications to manufacture, use and sell AVONEX, including a patent owned by the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, which expires in 2013 in the U.S. Additionally, we and third parties own pending U.S. patent applications related to recombinant interferon-beta protein and nucleic acid. These applications, which fall outside of the GATT amendments to the U.S. patent statute, are not published by the USPTO and, if they mature into granted patents, may be entitled to a term of seventeen years from the grant date. There are two pending interference proceedings in the USPTO involving such third party applications, and additional interferences could be declared in the future. We do not know which, if any, such applications will mature into patents with claims relevant to our AVONEX product or to pegylated beta interferon.

Additional protection for our pegylated beta interferon is provided by patents and patent applications with expiration dates in 2021 in the U.S. and 2019 in the E.U., with the potential for patent term extension.  We also expect our pegylated beta interferon to be granted regulatory exclusivity until 2026 in the U.S. and 2024 in the E.U.

TYSABRI

We and our collaborator, Elan, have patents and patent applications covering TYSABRI in the U.S. and other countries. These patents and patent applications cover TYSABRI and related manufacturing methods, as well as various methods of treatment using the product. In the U.S., the principal patents covering the product and use of the product to treat MS generally expire between 2015 and 2020. Additional U.S. patents and applications covering other indications, including treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and methods of manufacturing, generally expire between 2012 and 2020. In the rest of world, patents on the product and methods of manufacturing the product generally expire between 2015 and 2020, subject to any supplemental protection (i.e., patent term extension) certificates that may be obtained. In the rest of world, patents and patent applications covering methods of treatment using TYSABRI generally expire between 2012 and 2020.

RITUXAN and Anti-CD20 Antibodies

We have several U.S. patents and patent applications, and numerous corresponding foreign counterparts, directed to anti-CD20 antibody technology, including RITUXAN. The principal patents with claims to RITUXAN or its uses expire in the U.S. between 2015 and 2018 and in the rest of the world in 2013, subject to any available patent term extensions. In addition, we and our collaborator, Genentech, have filed numerous patent applications directed to anti-CD20 antibodies and their uses to treat various diseases. These pending patent applications have the potential of issuing as patents in the U.S. and in the rest of world with claims to anti-CD20 antibody molecules for periods beyond those stated above for RITUXAN. In 2008, a European patent of ours claiming the treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies of certain auto-immune indications, including RA, was revoked by the European Patent Office. We are appealing that decision.









Genentech, our collaborator on RITUXAN, has secured an exclusive license to five U.S. patents and counterpart U.S. and foreign patent applications assigned to Xoma Corporation that relate to chimeric antibodies against the CD20 antigen. These patents expire between 2007 and 2014. We, along with Genentech, share the cost of any royalties due to Xoma in our co-promotion territory on sales of RITUXAN.

FAMPYRA

We have an exclusive license under two European granted patents, several pending European patent applications and numerous corresponding non-U.S. counterpart applications related to FAMPYRA.  European patent EP0484186B1 claims pharmaceutical formulations containing aminopyridines including fampridine. This patent expired in November 2011 but is subject to pending and granted supplemental protection (i.e., patent term extension) certificates which, if granted, will extend the patent term to 2016 on a country-by-country basis. European patent EP1732548B1, which claims sustained-release aminopyridine compositions for increasing walking speed in patients with MS, expires in 2025 but is subject to pending and granted supplemental protection certificates which, if granted, will extend the patent term to 2026 on a country-by-country basis. In addition to these patent rights, FAMPYRA is covered by regulatory data protection in Europe until 2021.

TECFIDERA

We have several U.S. patents and patent applications, and a number of corresponding foreign counterparts, related to TECFIDERA. The principal U.S. patents are U.S. 6,509,376, having claims to formulations of dimethyl fumarate (the active ingredient of TECFIDERA) for use in the treatment of autoimmune diseases including MS, and U.S. 7,320,999 having claims to a method of treating MS using dimethyl fumarate. U.S. 6,509,376 and U.S. 7,320,999, expire in 2019 and 2020, respectively, subject to any available patent term extension following product approval. We also own a patent application, recently determined to be allowable by the USPTO, that covers the dosing regimen (240 mg of dimethyl fumarate administered twice a day) stated on our label under current review at the FDA.  Once granted, this patent will expire in 2028. The granted European patent, EP 1131065, is directed to formulations of dimethyl fumarate and to uses thereof for treating autoimmune diseases, including MS. EP 1131065 expires in 2019, subject to any potential supplemental patent certificates that may be available. The E.U. counterpart to our recently allowed dosing regimen application is pending at the European Patent Office. Our pending patent applications, if granted, would expire as late as 2033, subject to any potential patent term adjustments or extensions that may be available.

In addition to patent protection, TECFIDERA is entitled to regulatory data protection in both the U.S. and the E.U.  In the U.S., TECFIDERA is entitled to the 5 year data exclusivity given to new chemical entities. In the E.U. there are a number of ways to obtain data exclusivity and the EMA has informed us that TECFIDERA is, in principle, eligible for 8 years data exclusivity plus 2 years market exclusivity through the European centralized filing pathway.  In both the US and the EU, the period of data exclusivity runs from the date of approval of the marketing application.

Long-Lasting Recombinant Factors VIII and IX

We have several U.S. patents and patent applications, and a number of corresponding foreign counterparts, related to our long-lasting recombinant Factor VIII and Factor IX product candidates and their use, including U.S. patents nos. U.S. 7,404,956; U.S. 8,329,182;  U.S. 7,348,004;  and U.S. 7,862,820. These patents will expire in 2024 - 2025, and some may be entitled to additional patent term pursuant to the patent term adjustment or patent term extension provisions of the U.S. patent laws.  A related European patent, EP 1624891, expires in 2024 and may be entitled to additional patent term in at least some countries. Additionally, pending patent applications, if granted, would provide additional patent protection through 2033.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We focus our sales and marketing efforts on specialist physicians in private practice or at major medical centers. We use customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products and to educate physicians, such as sales representatives calling on individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, public relations and other methods. We provide customer service and other related programs for our products, such as disease and product-specific websites, insurance research services and order, delivery and fulfillment services. We have also established programs in the U.S. which provide qualified uninsured or underinsured patients with marketed products at no or reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria. Additional information about our sales, marketing and distribution efforts for our marketed products is set forth below.









AVONEX

We continue to focus our marketing and sales activities on maximizing the potential of AVONEX in the U.S. and the rest of world in the face of increased competition. The principal markets for AVONEX are the U.S., Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom. In the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Japan and most of the major countries of the E.U., we market and sell AVONEX through our own sales forces and marketing groups and distribute AVONEX principally through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service providers. In other countries, we sell AVONEX to distribution partners who are then responsible for most marketing and distribution activities.

TYSABRI

The principal markets for TYSABRI are the U.S., the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

In the U.S., we are principally responsible for marketing TYSABRI for MS and use our own sales force and marketing group for this. Elan is responsible for TYSABRI distribution in the U.S. and uses a third party distributor to ship TYSABRI directly to customers.

In the rest of world, we are responsible for TYSABRI marketing and distribution and we use a combination of our own sales force and marketing group and third party service providers.

RITUXAN

The Roche Group and its sub-licensees market and sell RITUXAN worldwide. We collaborate with Genentech, a wholly-owned member of the Roche Group, on the development and commercialization of RITUXAN, but Genentech maintains sole responsibility for the U.S. sales and marketing efforts related to RITUXAN. RITUXAN is generally sold to wholesalers, specialty distributors and directly to hospital pharmacies.

FAMPYRA

We market and sell FAMPYRA outside the U.S. through our own sales forces and marketing groups. Our development and commercialization rights do not include the U.S. market.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM is marketed only in Germany, through our own sales force and marketing group.

Competition

Competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense and comes from many and varied sources, including specialized biotechnology firms and large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors are working to develop products similar to those we are developing or already market and have considerable experience in undertaking clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical products. Certain of these companies have substantially greater financial, marketing and research and development resources than we do.

We believe that competition and leadership in the industry is based on managerial and technological superiority and establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to identify and exploit commercially the products resulting from research and the availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive within the industry is recruiting and retaining qualified scientists and technicians. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel.

Competition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, convenience, reliability, availability and price. In addition, early entry of a new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have an important impact on our competitive position.









We may face increased competitive pressures as a result of the emergence of biosimilars. In the U.S., most of our marketed products, including AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN, are licensed under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) as biological products. In March 2010, U.S. healthcare reform legislation amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve biological products, known as biosimilars or follow-on biologics, that are shown to be highly similar to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. The approval pathway for biosimilars does, however, grant a biologics manufacturer a 12 year period of exclusivity from the date of approval of its biological product before biosimilar competition can be introduced. Biosimilars legislation has also been in place in the E.U. since 2003. In December 2012, guidelines issued by the EMA for approving biosimilars of marketed monoclonal antibody products became effective. If a biosimilar version of one of our products were approved, it could reduce our sales of that product.

Additional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below.

AVONEX AND TYSABRI

Each of AVONEX and TYSABRI competes with the following products:

•COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate), which is marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. COPAXONE generated worldwide revenues of approximately $3.9 billion in 2011.

•REBIF (interferon-beta-1a), which is marketed by Merck (and co-promoted with Pfizer Inc. in the U.S.).  REBIF generated worldwide revenues of approximately $2.2 billion in 2011.

•BETASERON/BETAFERON (interferon-beta-1b), which is marketed by the Bayer Group.  BETASERON/BETAFERON generated worldwide revenues of approximately $1.4 billion in 2011.

•EXTAVIA (interferon-beta-1b), which is marketed by Novartis AG.  EXTAVIA generated worldwide revenues of approximately $154.0 million in 2011.

•GILENYA (fingolimod), which is marketed by Novartis AG. GILENYA generated worldwide revenues of approximately $494.0 million in 2011.

•AUBAGIO (teriflunomide), which is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis. AUBAGIO was approved in the U.S. in September 2012.

Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with AVONEX, TYSABRI or both. For example, a marketing application for LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) (developed by Sanofi-Aventis) has been filed as a potential treatment for MS. In addition, the commercialization of certain of our own pipeline product candidates, such as TECFIDERA, may also negatively impact future sales of AVONEX, TYSABRI or both.

FAMPYRA

FAMPYRA is indicated as a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with MS who have walking disability and is the first treatment that addresses this unmet medical need with demonstrated efficacy in people with all types of MS. The product benefits from exclusivity rights that prohibit generic versions from being manufactured. However, the exclusivity rights are set to expire in 2017, which is the earliest predictable date that a generic version may be available. There are no commercially available generic versions of FAMPYRA.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM competes with several different types of therapies in the psoriasis market within Germany, including oral systemics such as methotrexate and cyclosporine.

RITUXAN IN ONCOLOGY

RITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the oncology market, including:

•TREANDA (bendamustine HCL) (marketed by Cephalon), which is indicated for patients with indolent B-cell NHL that has progressed within 6 months of treatment with RITUXAN and for CLL.

•ARZERRA (ofatumumab) (marketed by GenMab in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline), which is indicated for refractory CLL patients to both alemtuzumab and fludarabine.

We are also aware of other anti-CD20 molecules in development, including our own product candidate GA101, that, if successfully developed and registered, may compete with RITUXAN in the oncology market.









RITUXAN IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS (RA)

RITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the RA market, including:

•traditional therapies for RA, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as steroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine, and pain relievers such as acetaminophen.

•TNF inhibitors, such as REMICADE (infliximab) and SIMPONI (golimumab) (marketed by Johnson & Johnson), HUMIRA (adalimumab) (marketed by AbbVie, Inc.), ENBREL (etanercept) (marketed by Amgen, Inc. and Pfizer) and CIMZIA (certolizumab pegol) (marketed by UCB, S.A.).

•ORENCIA (abatacept) (marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company).

•ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) (marketed by the Roche Group).

We are also aware of other products in development that, if successfully developed and registered, may compete with RITUXAN in the RA market.

Regulatory

Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulation.

Regulation of Pharmaceuticals

Product Approval and Post-Approval Regulation in the United States

Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. With limited exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failure to register a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and dosing regimen, and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application (BLA) or a New Drug Application (NDA). In response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.

The receipt of regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in preclinical or clinical tests, and the risks and benefits of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA will grant marketing approval. The agency may on occasion require the sponsor of a BLA or NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may lead to unanticipated delay or expense. Furthermore, even if a product is approved, the approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA's interpretation of the existing pre-clinical or clinical data.

The FDA has developed four distinct approaches intended to make therapeutically important drugs available as rapidly as possible, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: accelerated approval, fast track, breakthrough therapy, and priority review.

The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” status to products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints, or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the agency's accelerated approval regulations, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In addition, for products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors may be required to submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least thirty days prior to initial dissemination. The FDA may withdraw approval under accelerated approval after a hearing if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify any clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use, or if a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval.









In addition, the FDA may grant “fast track” status to products that treat serious diseases or conditions and fill an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product's development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for accelerated approval, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or BLA for FDA review before the entire filing is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval.

The FDA may also grant “breakthrough therapy” status to drugs designed to treat, alone or in combination with another drug or drugs, a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary evidence suggests a substantial improvement over existing therapies.  Such drugs need not address an unmet need, but are nevertheless eligible for expedited review if they offer the potential for an improvement.  Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA to offer product development or regulatory advice for the purpose of shortening the time to product approval.  Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will be developed or reviewed more quickly and does not ensure FDA approval.

Finally, the FDA may grant “priority review” status to products that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a NDA or BLA, with the goal for completing a priority review being six months (compared to ten months under standard review).

Regardless of the approval pathway employed, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the agency may withdraw its approval. In addition, regardless of the approval pathway, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it can mandate post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In such a case, the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous systems to assure use of the product under safe conditions. These systems are usually referred to as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). The FDA can impose financial penalties for failing to comply with certain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. In addition, any changes to an approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to implementation.

The FDA tracks information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing approval. Non-compliance with the FDA's safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Based on new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post-marketing studies (including additional clinical trials), or suspend or withdraw approval of the product. These requirements may affect our ability to maintain marketing approval of our products or require us to make significant expenditures to obtain or maintain such approvals.

If we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain manufacturing changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of a new indication, we are required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for a use other than that initially approved. FDA regulatory review may result in denial or modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.

In addition, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities and communications for products under its jurisdiction both before and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.

Product Approval and Post-Approval Regulation Outside the United States

We market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S. Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, where most of our ex-U.S. efforts are focused, there are several tracks for marketing approval, depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the NDA or BLA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), the expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission (EC). The CHMP opinion is not binding,









but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all member states. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products, and new treatments for neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.

In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has: (1) a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate application to and approval determination by each country; (2) a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and (3) a mutual recognition procedure, where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection, and evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, and the marketing authorization holder. In some regions, it is possible to receive an “accelerated” review whereby the national regulatory authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs.

Good Manufacturing Practices

Regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities, and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and product-specific regulations enforced by regulatory agencies following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies also conduct periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions or remedies against us, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing operations.

Good Clinical Practices

The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards for designing, conducting, monitoring, auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the rights and welfare of trial participants are adequately protected (commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP)). Regulatory agencies enforce cGCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, contract research organizations (CROs), and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable cGCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with cGCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other sanctions.

Orphan Drug Act

Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e., the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries to encourage the research, development and marketing of medicines to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases. In the E.U., medicinal products intended for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or very serious diseases affecting less than five in 10,000 people receive 10-year market exclusivity, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized procedure for marketing authorization.

Regulation Pertaining to Pricing and Reimbursement

In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability and amount of reimbursement by third party payers, including governments and private health plans. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control cost or affect utilization of our products. Private health plans may also seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the reimbursement by third party payors of newly approved health care products. The U.S. and foreign governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of our products which may have a significant impact on our business.









Within the U.S.

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to any customer (with limited exceptions). The rebate amount must be adjusted upward if AMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). The adjustment can cause the rebate amount to exceed the minimum 23.1% rebate amount. The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute governing the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program provides for civil monetary penalties.

Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of manufacturer discounts. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.

Our products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply Schedule (FSS). FSS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service (PHS). Coverage under Medicaid, the Medicare Part B program and the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index - Urban). In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties in addition to other penalties available to the government.

To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B, we are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.









Outside the U.S.

Outside the U.S., the E.U. represents our major market. Within the E.U., our products are paid for by a variety of payors, with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence reimbursement of products. Governments may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to control the cost of products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). Recent budgetary pressures in many E.U. countries are causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates, and expanded generic substitution and patient cost-sharing. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. For additional information related to our concentration of credit risk associated with certain international accounts receivable balances, please read the subsection below entitled “Market Risk-Credit Risk” in the “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this report.

Regulation Pertaining to Sales and Marketing

Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include federal “sunshine” provisions enacted in 2010 as part of the comprehensive federal health care reform legislation. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations. Outside the U.S., other countries have implemented requirements for disclosure of financial interactions with healthcare providers and additional countries may consider or implement such laws.

Other Regulations

Foreign Anti-Corruption

We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact with may meet the FCPA's definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.

The laws to which we are subject also include the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) which proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.









NIH Guidelines

We conduct research at our U.S. facilities in compliance with the current U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). By local ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts and RTP and are required to operate pursuant to certain permits.

Other Laws

Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

We have two “state-of-the-art” licensed biologics manufacturing facilities in RTP and Cambridge, Massachusetts.  The RTP site includes a 100,000 square foot manufacturing plant, which contains 6,000 (3 x 2,000) liters of bioreactor capacity, as well as a 250,000 square foot Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) plant which contains 90,000 (6 x 15,000) liters of bioreactor capacity.  The Cambridge site is a 70,000 square foot facility that contains 10,000 (5 x 2,000) liters of bioreactor capacity.  We also have a large-scale biologics manufacturing facility in Hillerød, Denmark which contains 90,000 liters of bioreactor capacity and, based on our current global manufacturing strategy, is expected to begin commercial operations in 2013, upon completion of the facility's validation activities. In December 2012, we entered into an arrangement with Eisai, Inc. to lease a portion of their facility in RTP to manufacture our and Eisai's oral solid dose products and for Eisai to provide us with vial-filling services for biologic therapies and packaging services for oral solid dose products. We also utilize an outsourced network to manufacture our small molecule products.

We currently manufacture AVONEX drug substance at our RTP and Cambridge facilities and TYSABRI drug substance at our RTP facility, and plan to also manufacture TYSABRI drug substance in our Hillerød facility in 2013.  Genentech is responsible for all worldwide manufacturing activities for bulk RITUXAN and has sourced the manufacture of certain bulk RITUXAN requirements to a third party. Acorda Therapeutics supplies FAMPYRA to us pursuant to its supply agreement with Alkermes, Inc. We use third parties to manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the final product for FUMADERM.

We source all of our fill-finish and the majority of final product storage operations for our products, along with a substantial part of our packaging operations, to a concentrated group of third party contractors. We have internal label and pack capability for clinical and commercial products at our Cambridge and Hillerød facilities. Raw materials and supplies required for the production of AVONEX, TYSABRI, FAMPYRA and FUMADERM are procured from various suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. Continuity of supply of raw materials is assured using a strategy of dual sourcing where possible or by a risk-based inventory strategy. Our third party service providers, suppliers and manufacturers may be subject to routine cGMP inspections by the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions and undergo assessment and certification by our quality management group.

We believe that our manufacturing facilities represent sufficient capacity for our own growing pipeline of products, as well as the products of potential partners.  In February 2012, we finalized an agreement with Samsung Biologics that established an entity based in Korea to develop, manufacture and market biosimilars.  Samsung will take a leading role in the entity, which has contracted with us for technical development services and biologics manufacturing.

Important factors that could adversely affect our manufacturing operations are discussed in the “Risk Factors” section of this report.
