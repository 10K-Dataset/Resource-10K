Marketed Products

AVONEX

AVONEX is one of the most prescribed
treatments in the world for relapsing forms of MS. MS is a progressive neurological disease in which the body loses the ability to transmit messages along nerve cells, leading to a loss of muscle control, paralysis and, in some cases, death.
Patients with active relapsing MS experience an uneven pattern of disease progression characterized by periods of stability that are interrupted by flare-ups of the disease after which the patient returns to a new baseline of functioning. AVONEX is
a recombinant form of the interferon beta protein produced in the body in response to viral infection.

2011 Developments



•We began making AVONEX PEN available in the E.U. and Canada following marketing approval during the first half of 2011, and we filed for marketing
approval of AVONEX PEN in the U.S. AVONEX PEN is the first single-use intramuscular autoinjector designed to improve the convenience of once-weekly AVONEX administration in patients with relapsing MS.



•In June 2011, we announced clinical trial data showing that titrating AVONEX at the initiation of treatment reduced the severity of flu-like
symptoms. The European Commission has approved the AVONEX titration kit, which is designed to help mitigate flu-like symptoms at the start of therapy, and we filed for marketing approval of the AVONEX titration kit in the U.S.

TYSABRI

TYSABRI has advanced the treatment of MS patients with its established efficacy. TYSABRI is a monoclonal antibody approved
in numerous countries as a monotherapy treatment for relapsing MS and also approved in the U.S. to treat Crohn’s disease, an inflammatory disease of the intestines.







TYSABRI increases the risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy
(PML), an opportunistic infection of the brain by the JC virus that often leads to death or severe disability. Factors that increase the risk of PML are presence of anti-JCV antibodies, prior immunosuppressant use, and longer TYSABRI treatment
duration. Patients who have all three risk factors have the highest risk of developing PML. Reports of cases of PML in patients treated with TYSABRI in clinical studies led us to voluntarily suspend the marketing and commercial distribution of
TYSABRI in February 2005 until its reintroduction to the market in July 2006. Because of the risk of PML, TYSABRI has a boxed warning and is marketed under risk management or minimization plans approved by regulatory authorities. In the U.S., for
example, TYSABRI is marketed under the TOUCH Prescribing Program, a restricted distribution program designed to assess and minimize the risk of PML, minimize death and disability due to PML, and promote informed risk-benefit decisions regarding
TYSABRI use.

U.S. and E.U. regulators continue to monitor and assess on an ongoing basis the criteria for
confirming PML diagnosis, the number of PML cases, the incidence of PML in TYSABRI patients, the risk factors for PML, and TYSABRI’s benefit-risk profile, which could result in modifications to the approved labels or other restrictions on
TYSABRI treatment. We continue to research and develop protocols and therapies that may reduce risk and improve outcomes of PML in patients. For example, we are conducting two clinical studies in the U.S., known as STRATIFY-1 and STRATIFY-2, that
collectively are intended to define the prevalence of serum JC virus antibody in patients with relapsing MS receiving or considering treatment with TYSABRI and to stratify patients into lower or higher risk for developing PML based on antibody
status.

We collaborate with Elan on the development and commercialization of TYSABRI. For information about
this collaboration, please read Note 20,Collaborationsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

2011-2012 Developments



•In January 2012, the FDA approved the inclusion of anti-JCV antibody status as an additional factor in stratifying patients for developing PML in
the U.S. product label for TYSABRI. The FDA also approved the inclusion of a table summarizing the estimated incidence of PML according to the duration of TYSABRI treatment, prior immunosuppressant use and anti-JCV antibody status. In addition, the
FDA granted Quest Diagnostics a de novo classification petition for the STRATIFY JCV Antibody ELISA testing service, which allows neurologists to determine their MS patients’ anti-JCV antibody status.



•In August 2011, our JC virus assay became commercially available broadly in the U.S. The assay was developed to detect the presence of anti-JC virus
antibodies in human serum and plasma. The assay became commercially available broadly in the E.U. in May 2011. The cost of the assay is currently shared by us and Elan.



•In June 2011, the European Commission approved the inclusion of anti-JC virus antibody status as an additional factor in stratifying patients for
developing PML in the E.U. product label for TYSABRI.



•In June 2011, as part of a standard review process, the European Commission concluded that the quality, safety and efficacy of TYSABRI continue to
be adequately demonstrated and renewed the E.U. five-year marketing authorization for TYSABRI. TYSABRI will undergo a second renewal process in another five years.

RITUXAN

RITUXAN is a widely prescribed monoclonal antibody therapeutic used to treat non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic lymphocytic leukemia and two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis.
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia are cancers that affect lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell that help to fight infection. Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic disease that occurs when the immune system
mistakenly attacks the body’s joints, resulting in inflammation, pain and joint damage. ANCA-associated vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disease that largely affects the small blood vessels of the kidneys, lungs, sinuses, and a variety of other
organs.







We collaborate with Genentech on the development and commercialization of
RITUXAN. For information about this collaboration, please read Note 20,Collaborationsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

2011 Developments



•In April 2011, the FDA approved RITUXAN, in combination with corticosteroids, as a treatment for adults with Wegener’s granulomatosis and
microscopic polyangiitis, two forms of ANCA-associated vasculitis.



•In January 2011, the FDA approved RITUXAN as a maintenance treatment for patients with advanced follicular lymphoma who responded to initial
treatment with RITUXAN plus chemotherapy (induction treatment). The European Commission approved RITUXAN for this indication in October 2010.

FAMPYRA

FAMPYRA is the first treatment that
addresses the unmet medical need of walking improvement in adult patients with MS who have walking disability. FAMPYRA is a prolonged-release tablet formulation of the drug fampridine. We launched FAMPYRA in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Norway and
the U.K. in 2011 and plan to launch in additional markets during 2012. We have a license from Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. to develop and commercialize FAMPYRA in all markets outside the U.S. For information about this relationship, please read
Note 20,Collaborationsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

2011 Developments



•In July 2011, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization for FAMPYRA in the E.U. To meet the conditions of this marketing
authorization, we will provide additional data from on-going clinical studies regarding FAMPYRA’s benefits and safety in the long term. A conditional marketing authorization is renewable annually and is granted to a medicinal product with a
positive benefit/risk assessment that fulfills an unmet medical need when the benefit to public health of immediate availability outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required.



•In May 2011, the Australian Therapeutics Goods Administration granted marketing approval for FAMPRYA in Australia.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM is approved for the treatment of severe psoriasis in Germany. Psoriasis is a skin disease in which cells build up on the skin surface and form scales and red patches.

Other Sources of Revenue

Our primary source of other revenue is derived from royalties received on sales by our licensees of other products covered under patents that we own. Our royalty revenues are dependent upon our
licensees’ sales of licensed products which could vary significantly due to competition, manufacturing, regulatory, safety or efficacy issues or other factors that are outside our control. In addition, the expiration or invalidation of any
underlying patents could reduce or eliminate the royalty revenues derived from such patents. Royalties on sales of ANGIOMAX by The Medicines Company (TMC) represent our most significant source of other revenue. TMC markets ANGIOMAX primarily in the
U.S. and the E.U. for use as an anticoagulant in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. For a description of this royalty arrangement and factors that could adversely affect this portion of our revenues, please read the
subsection entitled “Other Revenues — Royalty Revenues” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this report.







We have also sold or exclusively licensed to third parties rights to certain
products previously included within our product line. Supply agreement revenues received based upon those products are recorded as corporate partner revenues within our consolidated statements of income. Amounts recorded as corporate partner revenue
also include amounts earned upon delivery of product under contract manufacturing agreements.



(In millions)201120102009Royalty revenues$158.5$137.4$124.4Corporate partner revenues$57.4$31.7$5.1

2011 Developments



•The principal U.S. patent that covers ANGIOMAX (’404 Patent) was due to expire in March 2010 and TMC applied for an extension of the term of
this patent. Initially, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) rejected TMC’s application because in its view the application was not timely filed. TMC sued the PTO in federal district court seeking to extend the term of the ’404
patent to December 2014. On August 3, 2010, the federal district court ordered the PTO to deem the application as timely filed. The PTO has granted an interim extension of the patent term until August 13, 2012 pending completion of its review of
TMC’s application. A generic manufacturer challenged the federal district court’s order in an appellate proceeding, but on January 23, 2012 the manufacturer filed a motion to dismiss its appeal. The PTO has granted an interim extension of
the patent term until August 23, 2012 pending completion of its review of TMC’s application for extension to December 2014. For more information about our royalty revenues derived from sales of ANGIOMAX, please read the subsection entitled“Other Revenues - Royalty Revenues”in the“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”section of this report.

Late Stage Product Candidates

Additional information about our late stage product candidates is set forth below.

BG-12

In April 2011, we announced positive top-line results from DEFINE, the first of two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials designed to evaluate our investigational oral compound BG-12 (dimethyl fumarate) as a
monotherapy in relapsing MS. Results showed that 240 mg of BG-12, administered either twice or three times a day, met the primary and secondary study endpoints with a favorable safety and tolerability profile. In October 2011, we announced positive
top-line results from CONFIRM, the second of such pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials. Results showed that 240 mg of BG-12, administered either twice a day or three times a day, demonstrated significant efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability
profiles. We are preparing regulatory submissions for BG-12 based on the positive results from these two trials.

We acquired BG-12 as part of our acquisition of Fumapharm AG in 2006. For more information about this acquisition and
associated milestone obligations, please read the subsection entitled “Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements—Contingent Consideration” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations” section of this report.

Daclizumab

Daclizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is being tested in relapsing MS. In May 2010, we began patient enrollment in a
Phase 3 study of daclizumab in relapsing MS, known as DECIDE, evaluating the efficacy and safety of daclizumab compared to interferon beta-1a (AVONEX). The DECIDE trial is designed to have a two year endpoint and is expected to involve approximately
1,800 patients.

In August 2011, we announced positive results from SELECT, a global, registrational Phase
2b clinical trial designed to evaluate daclizumab in relapsing MS over one year. Results showed that daclizumab, administered subcutaneously once every four weeks, met primary and key secondary study endpoints, compared to placebo.

We collaborate with Abbott Biotherapeutics Corporation (Abbott) on the development and commercialization of daclizumab.
For information about this collaboration, please read Note 20,Collaborationsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Dexpramipexole

Dexpramipexole is an orally administered
small molecule in clinical development for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease and motor neuron disease, is a rapidly fatal, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive
muscle weakness and wasting. In the







fourth quarter of 2011, we completed enrollment in a Phase 3 study, known as EMPOWER, that is designed to follow patients for 1 year to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexpramipexole in
patients with ALS. There are over 900 patients participating in the study worldwide. Dexpramipexole has been granted fast track status by the FDA and has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of ALS from both the FDA and EMA.

We have a license agreement with Knopp Neurosciences, Inc. (Knopp) for the development, manufacture and
commercialization of dexpramipexole. For information about this relationship, please read Note 19,Investments in Variable Interest Entitiesto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

PEGylated interferon beta-1a

PEGylated interferon beta-1a is designed to prolong the effects and reduce the dosing frequency of interferon beta-1a. In the fourth quarter of 2011 we completed patient enrollment in a Phase 3 trial of
PEGylated interferon beta-1a in relapsing MS, known as ADVANCE, that is designed to have a one year primary endpoint and involve approximately 1,500 patients. The FDA has granted PEGylated interferon beta-1a fast track status.



TYSABRI (SPMS)



As part of our efforts with Elan to identify additional applications for TYSABRI, we began patient enrollment in a Phase
3b study of TYSABRI in secondary progressive MS, known as ASCEND. The study is designed to have an endpoint of approximately two years and involve approximately 850 patients.

Long-Lasting Recombinant Factors VIII and IX

Factor VIII
is a proprietary fusion protein that is being tested in hemophilia A, a disorder in which blood clotting is impaired. In November 2010, we began patient enrollment in a registrational trial of Factor VIII in hemophilia A, known as A-LONG. This study
will involve approximately 150 patients. Factor VIII has received orphan drug and fast track designation for the treatment of hemophilia A from both the FDA and EMA.

Factor IX is a proprietary fusion protein that is being tested in hemophilia B, a disorder in which blood clotting is
impaired. In December 2009, we began patient enrollment in a registrational trial of Factor IX in hemophilia B, known as B-LONG. This study will involve approximately 100 patients. Factor IX has received orphan drug and fast track designation
for the treatment of hemophilia B from both the FDA and EMA.

In 2011, we received opinions from the EMA’s
Pediatric Committee (PDCO) agreeing to pediatric investigational plans for Factor VIII and Factor IX. In accordance with the PDCO’s opinion, we plan to initiate global pediatric trials in previously-treated patients less than 12 years of age as
soon as sufficient data are available from studies of older patients. The PDCO opinions for Factor VIII and Factor IX are under guidelines published by the EMA for the development of Factor IX and Factor VIII products. Pediatric data from these
trials will be required in the initial submission of Marketing Authorization Applications to the European regulatory agency.

We collaborate with Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB on the commercialization of long-lasting recombinant Factors VIII and IX. For information about this collaboration, please read Note 20,Collaborationsto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

Patents and Other Proprietary Rights

Patents are important
to developing and protecting our competitive position. We regularly seek patent protection in the U.S. and in selected countries outside the U.S. for inventions originating from our research and development efforts. In addition, we license
rights to various patents and patent applications, generally, in return for the payment of royalties to the patent owner. U.S. patents, as well as most foreign patents, are generally effective for 20 years from the date the earliest
(priority) application was filed; however, U.S. patents that issue on applications filed before June 8, 1995 may be effective until 17 years from the issue date, if that is later than the 20 year date. In some cases, the
patent term may be extended to recapture a portion of the term lost during FDA regulatory review or because of U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) delays in prosecuting the application. The duration of foreign patents varies similarly, in
accordance with local law.

Regulatory data protection also can provide meaningful protection for our products.
Regulatory data protection provides to the holder of a drug or biologic marketing authorization, for a set period of time, the exclusive use of the proprietary pre-clinical and clinical data that it compiled at significant cost and submitted to the
applicable regulatory authority to obtain approval of its product. After the set period of time, third parties are then permitted to rely upon the data to obtain approval of their abbreviated applications to market generic drugs and biosimilars.
Although the World Trade Organization’s agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) requires signatory countries to provide regulatory data protection to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and
enforcement varies widely from country to country.







We also rely upon other forms of unpatented confidential information to
remain competitive. We protect such information principally through confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, scientists whose research we sponsor and other advisers. In the case of our employees,
these agreements also provide, in compliance with relevant law, that inventions and other intellectual property conceived by such employees during their employment shall be our exclusive property.

Our trademarks, including RITUXAN and AVONEX, are important to us and are generally covered by trademark applications or
registrations in the USPTO and the patent or trademark offices of other countries. We also use trademarks licensed from third parties, such as the mark TYSABRI which we license from Elan. Trademark protection varies in accordance with local law, and
continues in some countries as long as the mark is used and in other countries as long as the mark is registered. Trademark registrations generally are for fixed but renewable terms.

A discussion of certain risks and uncertainties that may affect our patent position and proprietary rights is set forth in
the “Risk Factors” section of this report.

Additional information about the patents and other
proprietary rights covering our marketed products and BG-12 is set forth below.

AVONEX and Beta Interferon

Our U.S. patent No. 7,588,755, granted in September 2009, claims the use of recombinant beta
interferon for immunomodulation or treating a viral condition, viral disease, cancers or tumors. This patent, which expires in September 2026, covers, among other things, the treatment of MS with our product AVONEX. A discussion of certain legal
proceedings related to this patent is set forth in Note 21,Litigationto our consolidated financial statements included in this report.

We have non-exclusive rights under certain third-party patents and patent applications to manufacture, use and sell AVONEX, including a patent owned by the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research, which
expires in 2013 in the U.S., and a European patent owned by Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH, which expires in 2012. Additionally, we and third parties own pending U.S. patent applications related to recombinant interferon-beta protein and
nucleic acid. These applications, which fall outside of the GATT amendments to the U.S. patent statute, are not published by the USPTO and, if they mature into granted patents, may be entitled to a term of seventeen years from the grant date.
There are two pending interference proceedings in the USPTO involving such third party applications, and additional interferences could be declared in the future. We do not know which, if any, such applications will mature into patents with claims
relevant to our AVONEX product.

TYSABRI

We and our collaborator, Elan, have patents and patent applications covering TYSABRI in the U.S. and other countries.
These patents and patent applications cover TYSABRI and related manufacturing methods, as well as various methods of treatment using the product. In the U.S., the principal patents covering the product and use of the product to treat MS generally
expire between 2015 and 2020. Additional U.S. patents and applications covering other indications, including treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, and methods of manufacturing, generally expire between 2012 and 2020. In the rest of world,
patents on the product and methods of manufacturing the product generally expire between 2015 and 2020, subject to any supplemental protection (i.e., patent term extension) certificates that may be obtained. In the rest of world, patents and patent
applications covering methods of treatment using TYSABRI generally expire between 2012 and 2020.

RITUXAN and Anti-CD20
Antibodies

We have several U.S. patents and patent applications, and numerous corresponding
foreign counterparts, directed to anti-CD20 antibody technology, including RITUXAN. The principal patents with claims to RITUXAN or its uses expire in the U.S. between 2015 and 2018 and in the rest of the world in 2013, subject to any available
patent term extensions. In addition, we and our collaborator, Genentech, have filed numerous







patent applications directed to anti-CD20 antibodies and their uses to treat various diseases. These pending patent applications have the potential of issuing as patents in the U.S. and in
the rest of world with claims to anti-CD20 antibody molecules for periods beyond those stated above for RITUXAN. In 2008, a European patent of ours claiming the treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies of certain auto-immune indications, including RA,
was revoked by the European Patent Office. We are appealing that decision.

Genentech, our collaborator on
RITUXAN, has secured an exclusive license to five U.S. patents and counterpart U.S. and foreign patent applications assigned to Xoma Corporation that relate to chimeric antibodies against the CD20 antigen. These patents expire between 2007
and 2014. Genentech has granted us a non-exclusive sublicense to make, have made, use and sell RITUXAN under these patents and patent applications. We, along with Genentech, share the cost of any royalties due to Xoma in our co-promotion territory
on sales of RITUXAN.

FAMPYRA

We have an exclusive license under two European granted patents, several pending European patent applications and numerous
corresponding non-U.S. counterpart applications related to FAMPYRA. One of the granted European patents claims pharmaceutical formulations containing aminopyridines such as fampridine. This patent expired in November 2011 but is subject to pending
supplemental protection (i.e., patent term extension) certificates which, if granted, will extend to 2016. The other European patent, EP Patent 1732548B1, which claims sustained-release aminopyridine compositions for increasing walking speed in
patients with MS, was granted in 2011. The patent expires in 2025 but is subject to pending supplemental protection certificates which, if granted, will extend to 2026. In addition we have a license under several pending applications directed to
various uses of fampridine, some of which, if granted, would expire as late as 2030.

In addition to patent
protection, FAMPYRA is protected by regulatory data protection in Europe until 2021.

BG-12

We have several U.S. patents and patent applications, and a number of corresponding foreign counterparts, related to
BG-12. The principal U.S. patents are U.S. 6,509,376, having claims to formulations of dimethyl fumarate (the active ingredient of BG-12) for use in the therapy of autoimmune diseases including MS, and U.S. 7,320,999 having claims to a
method of treating MS using dimethyl fumarate. U.S. 6,509,376 and U.S. 7,320,999, expire in 2019 and 2020, respectively, subject to any available patent term extension following product approval. The granted European patent, EP 1131065, is
directed to formulations of dimethyl fumarate and to uses thereof for treating autoimmune diseases, including MS. EP 1131065 expires in 2019, subject to any potential supplemental patent certificates that may be available. The pending
applications, if granted, would expire as late as 2032, subject to any potential patent term extensions that may be available following product approval.

In addition to patent protection, BG-12 is entitled to regulatory data protection. In the U.S., BG-12 is entitled to the 5 year data exclusivity given to new chemical entities. In the E.U. there are
a number of ways to obtain data exclusivity and we have confirmation from the EMA that BG-12 would, in principle, be eligible for 8 years data exclusivity plus 2 years market exclusivity based on information planned to be submitted to the agency as
part of the European centralized filing pathway.

Sales, Marketing and Distribution

We focus our sales and marketing efforts on specialist physicians in private practice or at major medical centers. We use
customary pharmaceutical company practices to market our products and to educate physicians, such as sales representatives calling on individual physicians, advertisements, professional symposia, direct mail, public relations and other methods. We
provide customer service and other related programs for our products, such as disease and product-specific websites, insurance research services and order, delivery and fulfillment services. We have also established programs in the U.S. which
provide qualified uninsured or underinsured patients with marketed products at no or reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria. Additional information about our sales, marketing and distribution efforts for our marketed products is set
forth below.







AVONEX

We continue to focus our marketing and sales activities on maximizing the potential of AVONEX in the U.S. and the
rest of world in the face of increased competition. The principal markets for AVONEX are the U.S., Germany, France and Italy. In the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Japan and most of the major countries of the E.U., we market and sell
AVONEX through our own sales forces and marketing groups and distribute AVONEX principally through wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products, mail order specialty distributors or shipping service providers. In other countries, we sell AVONEX
to distribution partners who are then responsible for most marketing and distribution activities.

TYSABRI

The principal markets for TYSABRI are the U.S., France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.

In the U.S., we are principally responsible for marketing TYSABRI for MS and use our own sales force and
marketing group for this. Elan is responsible for TYSABRI distribution in the U.S. and uses a third party distributor to ship TYSABRI directly to customers.

In the rest of world, we are responsible for TYSABRI marketing and distribution and we use a combination of our own sales
force and marketing group and third party service providers.

RITUXAN

The Roche Group and its sub-licensees market and sell RITUXAN worldwide. We collaborate with Genentech on the development
and commercialization of RITUXAN, but Genentech maintains sole responsibility for the U.S. sales and marketing efforts related to RITUXAN. RITUXAN is generally sold to wholesalers, specialty distributors and directly to hospital pharmacies.

FAMPYRA

We market and sell FAMPYRA outside the U.S. through our own sales forces and marketing groups. Our development and commercialization rights do not include the U.S. market.

FUMADERM

FUMADERM is marketed only in Germany, through our own sales force and marketing group.

Competition

Competition in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries is intense and comes from many and varied sources, including specialized biotechnology firms and large pharmaceutical companies. Many of our
competitors are working to develop products similar to those we are developing or already market and have considerable experience in undertaking clinical trials and in obtaining regulatory approval to market pharmaceutical products. Certain of these
companies have substantially greater financial, marketing and research and development resources than we do.

We believe that competition and leadership in the industry will be based on managerial and technological superiority and
establishing patent and other proprietary positions through research and development. The achievement of a leadership position also depends largely upon our ability to identify and exploit commercially the products resulting from research and the
availability of adequate financial resources to fund facilities, equipment, personnel, clinical testing, manufacturing and marketing. Another key aspect of remaining competitive within the industry is recruiting and retaining qualified scientists
and technicians. We believe that we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel.

Competition among products approved for sale may be based, among other things, on patent position, product efficacy, safety, convenience, reliability, availability and price. In addition, early entry of a
new pharmaceutical product into the market may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance and







market share. Accordingly, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete the testing and approval process and supply commercial quantities of products will have an important
impact on our competitive position.

We may face increased competitive pressures as a result of the emergence
of biosimilars. In the U.S., most of our marketed products, including AVONEX, TYSABRI and RITUXAN, are licensed under the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) as biological products. In March 2010, U.S. healthcare reform legislation amended the
PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve biological products, known as biosimilars or follow-on biologics, that are shown to be highly similar to previously approved biological products based upon potentially abbreviated data packages. The approval
pathway for biosimilars does, however, grant a biologics manufacturer a 12 year period of exclusivity from the date of approval of its biological product before biosimilar competition can be introduced. Biosimilars legislation has also been in
place in the E.U. since 2003. In November 2010, draft guidelines issued by the EMA for approving biosimilars of marketed monoclonal antibody products were adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP). These guidelines
are now out for public consultation. If a biosimilar version of one of our products were approved, it could reduce our sales of that product.

Additional information about the competition that our marketed products face is set forth below.

AVONEX AND TYSABRI

Each of AVONEX and TYSABRI
competes with the following products:



•COPAXONE (glatiramer acetate), which is marketed by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. in the U.S. and copromoted by Teva Pharmaceutical
Industries and Sanofi-Aventis in Europe. COPAXONE generated worldwide revenues of approximately $3.3 billion in 2010.



•REBIF (interferon-beta-1a), which is co-promoted by EMD Serono, a subsidiary of Merck Serono, and Pfizer Inc. in the U.S. and is marketed by
Merck Serono in the E.U. REBIF generated worldwide revenues of approximately $2.3 billion in 2010.



•BETASERON (interferon-beta-1b), which is marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the U.S. pharmaceuticals affiliate of Bayer Schering
Pharma AG, in the U.S. and is marketed under the name BETAFERON by Bayer Schering Pharma AG in the E.U. BETASERON and BETAFERON together generated worldwide revenues of approximately $1.7 billion in 2010.



•EXTAVIA (interferon-beta-1b), which is marketed by Novartis AG in the U.S., E.U. and other markets. EXTAVIA generated worldwide revenues of
approximately $124.0 million in 2010.



•GILENYA (fingolimod), which is marketed by Novartis AG in the U.S., E.U. and other markets. GILENYA was launched in October 2010 as the first oral
MS drug approved in the U.S. GILENYA generated revenue of approximately $15.0 million in 2010 and $494.0 million in 2011.

Along with us, a number of companies are working to develop additional treatments for MS that may in the future compete with AVONEX, TYSABRI or both. For example, teriflunomide (developed by
Sanofi-Aventis) and LEMTRADA (alemtuzumab) (developed by Genzyme Corporation) have filed or are expected to file for marketing approval as treatments for MS. In addition, the commercialization of certain of our own pipeline product candidates, such
as BG-12, may also negatively impact future sales of AVONEX, TYSABRI or both.

FAMPYRA

FAMPYRA is indicated as a treatment to improve walking in adult patients with MS who have walking disability and is the
first treatment that addresses this unmet medical need with demonstrated efficacy in people with all types of MS. AMPYRA (dalfampridine) is protected by exclusivity rights that prohibit a generic version of the drug from being
manufactured. However, the exclusivity rights are set to expire in 2017, which is the earliest predictable date that a generic version may be available. There are no commercially available generic versions of FAMPYRA.







FUMADERM

FUMADERM competes with several different types of therapies in the psoriasis market within Germany, including oral
systemics such as methotrexate and cyclosporine.

RITUXAN IN ONCOLOGY

RITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the oncology market, including:



•CAMPATH (alemtuzumab) (marketed by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals), which is indicated for B-cell CLL.



•TREANDA (bendamustine HCL) (marketed by Cephalon) and ARZERRA (ofatumumab) (marketed by GenMab in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline), which is
indicated for refractory CLL patients to both alemtuzumab and fludarabine.

We are also aware
of other anti-CD20 molecules in development, including our own product candidate GA101, that, if successfully developed and registered, may compete with RITUXAN in the oncology market.

RITUXAN IN RA

RITUXAN competes with several different types of therapies in the RA market, including:



•traditional therapies for RA, including disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs such as steroids, methotrexate and cyclosporine, and pain relievers
such as acetaminophen.



•TNF inhibitors, such as REMICADE (infliximab) and SIMPONI (golimumab) (marketed by Johnson & Johnson), HUMIRA (adalimumab) (marketed by
Abbott Laboratories), ENBREL (etanercept) (marketed by Amgen, Inc. and Pfizer) and CIMZIA (certolizumab pegol) (marketed by UCB, S.A.).



•ORENCIA (abatacept) (marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company).



•ACTEMRA (tocilizumab) (marketed by the Roche Group).

We are also aware of other products in development that, if successfully developed and registered, may compete with
RITUXAN in the RA market.

Regulatory

Our current and contemplated activities and the products and processes that will result from such activities are subject to substantial government regulation.

Regulation of Pharmaceuticals

Product Approval and Post-Approval Regulation in the United States

Before new pharmaceutical products may be sold in the U.S., preclinical studies and clinical trials of the products must be conducted and the results submitted to the FDA for approval. With limited
exceptions, the FDA requires companies to register both pre-approval and post-approval clinical trials and disclose clinical trial results in public databases. Failure to register a trial or disclose study results within the required time periods
could result in penalties, including civil monetary penalties. Clinical trial programs must establish efficacy, determine an appropriate dose and dosing regimen, and define the conditions for safe use. This is a high-risk process that requires
stepwise clinical studies in which the candidate product must successfully meet predetermined endpoints. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a product are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a Biologics License Application
(BLA) or a New Drug Application (NDA). In response to a BLA or NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if it determines the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval.

The receipt of regulatory approval often takes a number of years, involves the expenditure of substantial
resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the disease in question, the availability of alternative treatments, potential safety signals observed in preclinical or clinical tests, and the risks and benefits







of the product as demonstrated in clinical trials. The FDA has substantial discretion in the product approval process, and it is impossible to predict with any certainty whether and when the FDA
will grant marketing approval. The agency may on occasion require the sponsor of a BLA or NDA to conduct additional clinical studies or to provide other scientific or technical information about the product, and these additional requirements may
lead to unanticipated delay or expense.

The FDA has developed three distinct approaches intended to make
therapeutically important drugs available as rapidly as possible, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: accelerated approval, fast track and priority review.

The FDA may grant “accelerated approval” status to products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and
that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this pathway, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints, or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. When approval is
based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the Agency’s Accelerated
Approval regulations, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it will require certain post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In addition, for
products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors must submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least thirty days prior to initial dissemination. The FDA may withdraw approval under accelerated
approval after a hearing if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify any clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use, or if a sponsor fails to comply with
the conditions of the accelerated approval.

In addition, the FDA may grant “fast track” status to
products that treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s
development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, eligibility for accelerated approval, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or BLA for FDA review before the
entire filing is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval.

Finally, the FDA may grant “priority review” status to products that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. Priority review is intended to
reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review a NDA or BLA, with the goal for completing a priority review being six months (compared to ten months under standard review).

Regardless of the approval pathway employed, the FDA may require a sponsor to conduct additional post-marketing studies as
a condition of approval to provide data on safety and effectiveness. If a sponsor fails to conduct the required studies, the agency may withdraw its approval. In addition, regardless of the approval pathway, if the FDA concludes that a drug that has
shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it can mandate post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In such a case, the sponsor may be required to establish rigorous systems to assure use
of the product under safe conditions. These systems are usually referred to as Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS). The FDA can impose financial penalties for failing to comply with certain post-marketing commitments, including REMS. In
addition, any changes to an approved REMS must be reviewed and approved by the FDA prior to implementation.

The FDA tracks information on side effects and adverse events reported during clinical studies and after marketing
approval. Non-compliance with the FDA’s safety reporting requirements may result in civil or criminal penalties. Side effects or adverse events that are reported during clinical trials can delay, impede, or prevent marketing approval. Based on
new safety information that emerges after approval, the FDA can mandate product labeling changes, impose a new REMS or the addition of elements to an existing REMS, require new post-marketing studies (including additional clinical trials), or
suspend or withdraw approval of the product. These requirements may affect our ability to maintain marketing approval of our products or require us to make significant expenditures to obtain or maintain such approvals.

If we seek to make certain types of changes to an approved product, such as adding a new indication, making certain
manufacturing changes, or changing manufacturers or suppliers of certain ingredients or components, the FDA will need to review and approve such changes in advance. In the case of a new indication,







we are required to demonstrate with additional clinical data that the product is safe and effective for a use other than that initially approved. FDA regulatory review may result in denial or
modification of the planned changes, or requirements to conduct additional tests or evaluations that can substantially delay or increase the cost of the planned changes.

In addition, the FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both before
and after approval. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. However, physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug’s labeling. Such
off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician’s belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but the
FDA regulations do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label uses. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective
advertising, and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.

Product Approval and Post-Approval
Regulation Outside the United States

We market our products in numerous jurisdictions outside the U.S.
Most of these jurisdictions have product approval and post-approval regulatory processes that are similar in principle to those in the U.S. In Europe, where most of our ex-U.S. efforts are focused, there are several tracks for marketing approval,
depending on the type of product for which approval is sought. Under the centralized procedure, a company submits a single application to the EMA. The marketing application is similar to the NDA or BLA in the U.S. and is evaluated by the CHMP, the
expert scientific committee of the EMA. If the CHMP determines that the marketing application fulfills the requirements for quality, safety, and efficacy, it will submit a favorable opinion to the European Commission (EC). The CHMP opinion is not
binding, but is typically adopted by the EC. A marketing application approved by the EC is valid in all member states. The centralized procedure is required for all biological products, orphan medicinal products, and new treatments for
neurodegenerative disorders, and it is available for certain other products, including those which constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation.

In addition to the centralized procedure, Europe also has: (1) a nationalized procedure, which requires a separate
application to and approval determination by each country; (2) a decentralized procedure, whereby applicants submit identical applications to several countries and receive simultaneous approval; and (3) a mutual recognition procedure,
where applicants submit an application to one country for review and other countries may accept or reject the initial decision. Regardless of the approval process employed, various parties share responsibilities for the monitoring, detection, and
evaluation of adverse events post-approval, including national authorities, the EMA, the EC, and the marketing authorization holder. In some regions, it is possible to receive an “accelerated” review whereby the national regulatory
authority will commit to truncated review timelines for products that meet specific medical needs.

Good Manufacturing
Practices

Regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities, and processes used in the
manufacturing and testing of pharmaceutical and biologic products prior to approving a product. If, after receiving clearance from regulatory agencies, a company makes a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, additional
regulatory review and approval may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) and product-specific regulations enforced by regulatory agencies following product approval. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory
agencies also conduct periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If, as a result of these inspections, it is determined that our equipment, facilities, or processes do not comply
with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal, or administrative sanctions or remedies against us, including significant financial penalties and the suspension of our manufacturing
operations.







Good Clinical Practices

The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory agencies promulgate regulations and standards for designing, conducting, monitoring,
auditing and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are accurate and that the rights and welfare of trial participants are adequately protected (commonly referred to as current Good Clinical Practices (cGCP)).
Regulatory agencies enforce cGCP through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites, contract research organizations (CROs), and institutional review boards. If our studies fail to comply with applicable cGCP,
the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and relevant regulatory agencies may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. Noncompliance can also result in civil or
criminal sanctions. We rely on third parties, including CROs, to carry out many of our clinical trial-related activities. Failure of such third parties to comply with cGCP can likewise result in rejection of our clinical trial data or other
sanctions.

Orphan Drug Act

Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which generally is a disease or condition that affects
fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. If a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, i.e.,
the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years following marketing approval, except in certain very limited circumstances, such as if the later product is shown to be
clinically superior to the orphan product. Legislation similar to the U.S. Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries to encourage the research, development and marketing of medicines to treat, prevent or diagnose rare diseases. In the
E.U., medicinal products intended for diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or very serious diseases affecting less than five in 10,000 people receive 10-year market exclusivity, protocol assistance, and access to the centralized
procedure for marketing authorization.

Regulation Pertaining to Pricing and Reimbursement

In both domestic and foreign markets, sales of our products depend, in part, on the availability and amount of
reimbursement by third party payers, including governments and private health plans. Governments may regulate coverage, reimbursement and pricing of our products to control cost or affect utilization of our products. Private health plans may also
seek to manage cost and utilization by implementing coverage and reimbursement limitations. Substantial uncertainty exists regarding the reimbursement by third party payors of newly approved health care products. The U.S. and foreign
governments regularly consider reform measures that affect health care coverage and costs. Such reforms may include changes to the coverage and reimbursement of our products which may have a significant impact on our business.

Within the U.S.

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that is administered by the states for low income and disabled beneficiaries. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we are required to pay a rebate for each
unit of product reimbursed by the state Medicaid programs. The amount of the rebate for each product is set by law as the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (AMP) or the difference between AMP and the best price available from us to
any customer (with limited exceptions). The rebate amount must be adjusted upward if AMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index — Urban). The adjustment can cause the rebate amount to exceed the minimum 23.1%
rebate amount. The rebate amount is calculated each quarter based on our report of current AMP and best price for each of our products to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The requirements for calculating AMP and best price are
complex. We are required to report any revisions to AMP or best price previously reported within a certain period, which revisions could affect our rebate liability for prior quarters. In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are
found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the statute provides for civil monetary penalties.

Medicare is a federal program that is administered by the federal government that covers individuals age 65 and over as well as those with certain disabilities. Medicare Part B generally covers
drugs that must be administered by physicians or other health care practitioners; are provided in connection with certain durable







medical equipment; or are certain oral anti-cancer drugs and certain oral immunosuppressive drugs. Medicare Part B pays for such drugs under a payment methodology based on the average sales price
(ASP) of the drugs. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide ASP information to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services on a quarterly basis. The manufacturer-submitted information is used to calculate Medicare payment
rates. The current payment rate for Medicare Part B drugs is ASP plus 6% outside the hospital outpatient setting and ASP plus 4% for most drugs in the hospital outpatient setting. The payment rates for drugs in the hospital outpatient setting are
subject to periodic adjustment. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services also has the statutory authority to adjust payment rates for specific drugs outside the hospital outpatient setting based on a comparison of ASP payment rates to
widely available market prices or to AMP, which could decrease Medicare payment rates, but the authority has not yet been implemented. If a manufacturer is found to have made a misrepresentation in the reporting of ASP, the statute provides for
civil monetary penalties.

Medicare Part D provides coverage to enrolled Medicare patients for
self-administered drugs (i.e., drugs that do not need to be injected or otherwise administered by a physician). Medicare Part D is administered by private prescription drug plans approved by the U.S. government and each drug plan establishes its own
Medicare Part D formulary for prescription drug coverage and pricing, which the drug plan may modify from time-to-time. The prescription drug plans negotiate pricing with manufacturers and may condition formulary placement on the availability of
manufacturer discounts. Manufacturers, including us, are required to provide a 50% discount on brand name prescription drugs utilized by Medicare Part D beneficiaries when those beneficiaries reach the coverage gap in their drug benefits.

Our products are subject to discounted pricing when purchased by federal agencies via the Federal Supply
Schedule (FSS). FFS participation is required for our products to be covered and reimbursed by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service (PHS). Coverage under Medicaid, the Medicare Part B program and
the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program is also conditioned upon FSS participation. FSS pricing is negotiated periodically with the Department of Veterans Affairs. FSS pricing is intended not to exceed the price that we charge our most-favored
non-federal customer for a product. In addition, prices for drugs purchased by the Veterans Administration, Department of Defense (including drugs purchased by military personnel and dependents through the TriCare retail pharmacy program), Coast
Guard, and PHS are subject to a cap on pricing equal to 76% of the non-federal average manufacturer price (non-FAMP). An additional discount applies if non-FAMP increases more than inflation (measured by the Consumer Price Index — Urban).
In addition, if we fail to provide information timely or we are found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, the governing statute provides for civil monetary penalties in addition to other penalties available to the
government.

To maintain coverage of our products under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and Medicare Part B,
we are required to extend discounts to certain purchasers under the PHS pharmaceutical pricing program. Purchasers eligible for discounts include hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of financially needy patients, community health clinics
and other entities that receive health services grants from the PHS.

Outside the U.S.

Outside the U.S., the E.U. represents our major market. Within the E.U., our products are paid for by a variety of payors,
with governments being the primary source of payment. Governments may determine or influence coverage of products. Governments may also set prices or otherwise regulate pricing. Negotiating prices with governmental authorities can delay
commercialization of our products. Governments may use a variety of cost-containment measures to products, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using
those reference prices to set a price). Recent budgetary pressures in many E.U. countries are causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget
pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. For additional information related to our concentration of credit risk associated with certain international accounts receivable balances, please read the subsection
below entitled “Market Risk—Credit Risk” in the “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” section of this report.







Regulation Pertaining to Sales and Marketing

Laws and regulations have been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing
practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers or require disclosure to the government and public of such interactions. The laws include
federal “sunshine” provisions enacted in 2010 as part of the comprehensive federal health care reform legislation. The sunshine provisions apply to pharmaceutical manufacturers with products reimbursed under certain government programs and
require those manufacturers to disclose annually to the federal government (for re-disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require
disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the
penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.

Other Regulations

Foreign Anti-Corruption

We are subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern our international business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. companies and their representatives from paying, offering to pay, promising, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political
party, or political candidate for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or to otherwise obtain favorable treatment or influence a person working in an official capacity. In many countries, the health care professionals we regularly interact
with may meet the FCPA’s definition of a foreign government official. The FCPA also requires public companies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system
of internal accounting controls.

In July 2011, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (Bribery Act) became effective. The
Bribery Act proscribes giving and receiving bribes in the public and private sectors, bribing a foreign public official, and failing to have adequate procedures to prevent employees and other agents from giving bribes. U.S. companies that conduct
business in the United Kingdom generally will be subject to the Bribery Act. Penalties under the Bribery Act include potentially unlimited fines for companies and criminal sanctions for corporate officers under certain circumstances.

NIH Guidelines

We conduct research at our U.S. facilities in compliance with the current U.S. National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant DNA Molecules (NIH Guidelines). By local
ordinance, we are required to, among other things, comply with the NIH Guidelines in relation to our facilities in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina and are required to operate pursuant to certain permits.







Other Laws

Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various
laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous
substances, including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents, used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights may be subject
to national or international antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.

Manufacturing and Raw Materials

We are focused on the manufacture of biologics at our facilities, but also market small molecule products that are manufactured using an outsourced network. We operate licensed biological
bulk-manufacturing facilities in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina (RTP) and Cambridge, Massachusetts, including a 250,000 square foot large-scale manufacturing plant with 90,000 liters of bioreactor capacity in RTP. We also have a large-scale
biologics manufacturing facility in Hillerød, Denmark that, based on our current global manufacturing strategy, is expected to begin commercial operations in the second half of 2012, upon completion of the facility’s validation
activities.

We currently manufacture AVONEX drug substance at our RTP and Cambridge facilities. We currently
manufacture TYSABRI drug substance at our RTP facility through a high-titer process and plan to also manufacture TYSABRI drug substance in our Hillerød facility in the second half of 2012. Genentech is responsible for all worldwide
manufacturing activities for bulk RITUXAN and has sourced the manufacture of certain bulk RITUXAN requirements to a third party. Acorda Therapeutics supplies FAMPYRA to us pursuant to its supply agreement with Alkermes, Inc. We use third parties to
manufacture the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the final product for FUMADERM.

We source all of our
fill-finish and the majority of final product storage operations for our products, along with a substantial part of our packaging operations, to a concentrated group of third party contractors. We have internal label and pack capability for clinical
and commercial products at our Cambridge and Hillerød facilities. Raw materials and supplies required for the production of AVONEX, TYSABRI, FAMPYRA and FUMADERM are procured from various suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs.
Continuity of supply of raw materials is assured using a strategy of dual sourcing where possible or by a risk-based inventory strategy. Each of our third party service providers, suppliers and manufacturers is subject to routine cGMP inspections by
the FDA or comparable agencies in other jurisdictions.

We believe that our manufacturing facilities represent
sufficient capacity for our own growing pipeline of products, as well as the products of potential partners. In December 2011, we entered into an agreement with Samsung to establish an entity based in Korea to develop, manufacture and market
biosimilars. Samsung will take a leading role in the entity, which will contract with Biogen Idec for technical development services and biologics manufacturing. Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions.

Important factors that could adversely affect our manufacturing operations are discussed in the “Risk
Factors” section of this report.

Our Employees
