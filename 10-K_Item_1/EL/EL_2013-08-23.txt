Item 1.Business.



The Estée Lauder Companies Inc., founded in 1946 by Estée and Joseph Lauder, is one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  Our products are sold in over 150 countries and territories under a number of well-known brand names including: Estée Lauder, Aramis, Clinique, Origins, MžAžC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer and Aveda.  We are also the global licensee for fragrances and/or cosmetics sold under brand names such as Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Michael Kors, Tom Ford and Coach.  Each brand is distinctly positioned within the market for cosmetics and other beauty products.



We are a pioneer in the cosmetics industry and believe we are a leader in the industry due to the global recognition of our brand names, our leadership in product innovation, our strong market position in key geographic markets and the consistently high quality of our products and “High-Touch” services.  We sell our prestige products principally through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated with our brands.  These channels, encompassing over 30,000 points of sale, consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas.  In addition, our products are sold in freestanding stores, our own and authorized retailer websites, stores on cruise ships, in-flight, and duty-free shops, as well as by direct response television (“DRTV”), and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets.  We believe that our strategy of pursuing selective distribution strengthens our relationships with retailers, enables our brands to be among the best selling product lines at the stores and heightens the aspirational quality of our brands.

Given the personal nature of our products and the wide array of consumer preferences and tastes, as well as competition for the attention of consumers, our strategy has been to market and promote our products through distinctive brands seeking to address broad preferences and tastes.  Each brand has a single global image that is promoted with consistent logos, packaging and advertising designed to enhance its image and differentiate it from other brands.

Distribution



We sell our products primarily through limited distribution channels to complement the images associated with our brands.  These channels include more than 30,000 points of sale in over 150 countries and territories and consist primarily of upscale department stores, specialty retailers, upscale perfumeries and pharmacies and prestige salons and spas.  In addition, our products are sold in Company and distributor-operated freestanding stores and other freestanding retail formats (e.g., pop-up stores), our own and authorized retailer websites, stores on cruise ships, in-flight and duty-free shops, and DRTV and certain fragrances are sold in self-select outlets.  As is customary in the cosmetics industry, our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested, authorized and approved.



We maintain a dedicated sales force which sells to our retail accounts in North America and in the major overseas markets, and in the travel retail channel.  We have wholly-owned operations in over 50 countries, and a controlling interest in a joint venture that operates in three countries, through which we market, sell and distribute our products.  In certain countries, we sell our products through select local distributors under contractual arrangements designed to protect the image and position of the brands.  In addition, we sell certain products in select domestic and international military locations.  For information regarding our net sales and long-lived assets by geographic region, see“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 – Segment Data and Related Information.”



We sell Aveda products primarily to independent salons and spas, cosmetology schools, third-party distributors and specialty retailers and directly to consumers online, and at our Aveda Experience Centers and certain Aveda Institutes.  There are currently about 8,700 points of sale, primarily in the United States, that sell Aveda products.  Bumble and bumble products are principally sold to about 3,500 independent salons and specialty stores, primarily in the United States.  Darphin products are primarily sold through high-end independent pharmacies, principally in Europe, representing approximately 3,600 points of sale.



As part of our strategy to diversify our distribution, we have been selectively opening new single-brand stores that we or our distributors operate.  The Origins, Aveda and MžAžC brands have been the primary focus for this method of distribution, and we are expanding to other brands.  As of August 19, 2013, we operate approximately 690 single-brand stores worldwide, the majority of which are in the United States, and expect that number to increase moderately over the next several years.  We also operate approximately 130 multi-brand stores.



We primarily sell Flirt!, GoodSkin Labs, American Beauty and grassroots research labs products in approximately 1,100 Kohl’s Department Stores in the United States and internationally in pharmacies, perfumeries and department stores representing approximately 1,400 additional points of sale.



We currently sell products from 15 of our brands directly to consumers online through approximately 180 of our own e-commerce and certain of our m-commerce sites.  Some or all of these brands are sold online in 20 countries including the following: the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Austria, Brazil, Russia, Denmark, Italy, Australia, Korea, China and Japan.



Customers



Our strategy is to build strong relationships with selected retailers globally.  Senior management works with executives of our major retail accounts on a regular basis, and we believe we are viewed as an important supplier to these customers.  Our largest customer, Macy’s Inc., sells products primarily within the United States and accounted for 11% of our consolidated net sales for fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 and 10% of our accounts receivable as of June 30, 2013 and 2012.



Marketing

ž

C and Bobbi Brown Makeup Artists.  At in-store counters, consumers are offered a “High-Touch” experience with personal consultations to market individual products as well as to provide education on their use and application.  We conduct extensive sampling programs and we pioneered gift with purchase as a sampling program.  We believe that the quality and perceived benefits of sample products have been effective inducements to purchases by new and existing consumers.



- 5 -








Our “High-Touch” approach promotes the total value we offer by leveraging our in-person and virtual assets, as well as merchandising and education, to provide a customized consumer experience.  To support this initiative, we continue to expand our online strategy into a multi-pronged digital strategy that encompasses e-commerce, m-commerce, as well as digital and social media.  We have dedicated resources to implement coordinated, brand-enhancing strategies across all online activities to increase our direct access to consumers.  We continue to use the Internet to educate and inform consumers about certain of our brands.  Currently, 18 of our brands have marketing sites.  In order to continue to offer unparalleled service and set the standard for prestige beauty shopping online, we partner with key “brick and mortar” retailers to strengthen their e-commerce business and drive sales of our brands on their websites, continue to innovate to better meet consumer online shopping preferences (e.g., how-to videos, ratings and reviews and mobile phone and tablet applications), and support e-commerce and m-commerce business via digital and social marketing activities designed to build brand equity and consumer engagement.



Most of our creative marketing work is done by in-house creative teams.  The creative staff designs and produces the sales materials, advertisements and packaging for products in each brand.



Global net expenses for advertising, merchandising, sampling, promotion and product development costs were $2,798.0 million, $2,655.7 million and $2,345.8 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  These amounts include activities relating to purchase with purchase promotions that are reflected in net sales and cost of sales and gift with purchase promotions that are reflected in cost of sales.



Information Systems



Information systems support business processes including product development, marketing, sales, order processing, production, distribution and finance.  We expect that these systems will continue to provide pertinent inventory and sales data in the short term.  As part of our long-term effort to enhance these systems and increase productivity, we continue to implement our Strategic Modernization Initiative (“SMI”), which includes an enterprise-wide global program that we expect will deliver a single set of integrated data, processes and technologies, which would be scalable and used to standardize business processes across brands, operating units and sales locations.  As part of SMI, we anticipate the continued migration of our operations to SAP-based technologies (“SAP”) with the majority of our locations being enabled through calendar 2014.



In parallel with our SAP deployment, we are creating a more focused global information technology organization utilizing industry standard processes.  We are also taking this opportunity to rebalance our information technology resources to better align with our global business growth.  We plan to continue to explore opportunities to create a more efficient organization.



Of the many systems currently being utilized, the most significant to our business needs are: (i) a centralized data repository of essential attributes for each of the products we offer, or plan to offer, which enables us to globally manufacture and market products of consistent quality; (ii) a sales analysis system to track weekly sales at the stock keeping unit (“SKU”) level at most significant retail sales locations (i.e. sell-through data), increasing our understanding of consumer preferences and enabling us to coordinate more effectively our product development, manufacturing and marketing strategies; (iii) an automated replenishment system with many of our key domestic customers, allowing us to replenish inventories for individual points of sale automatically, with minimal paperwork; and (iv) an inventory management system that provides us with a global view of finished goods availability relative to forecasted requirements.  As we continue to modernize our key processes and the related systems and infrastructure, we are developing upgraded capabilities to support our human resource and retail operations.  The plan is to progressively develop and deploy key systems globally over the next several years as appropriate according to local requirements and priorities.



Research and Development



We believe that we are an industry leader in the development of new products.  Marketing, product development and packaging groups work with our research and development group to identify shifts in consumer preferences, develop new products and improve, redesign or reformulate existing products.  In addition, research and development personnel work closely with quality assurance and manufacturing personnel on a worldwide basis to provide ongoing technical assistance and know-how, to ensure consistent global standards for our products and to deliver products with attributes that fulfill consumer expectations.  The research and development group has long-standing working relationships with several U.S. and international medical and educational facilities, which supplement internal capabilities.  Members of the group are also responsible for regulatory compliance matters.



We do not conduct animal testing on our products or ingredients, nor ask others to test on our behalf, except when required by law.



As of June 30, 2013, we had approximately 500 employees engaged in research and development.  Research and development costs totaled $103.6 million, $96.5 million and $85.7 million in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  We maintain research and development programs at certain of our principal facilities and facilities dedicated to performing research and development, see “Item 2. Properties.”

Manufacturing, Warehousing and Raw Materials



We manufacture our products primarily in the United States, Belgium, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Canada.  We continue to streamline our manufacturing processes and identify sourcing opportunities to improve innovation, increase efficiencies and reduce costs.  Our major manufacturing facilities operate as “focus” plants that primarily manufacture one type of product (e.g., lipsticks) for all of the principal brands.  Our plants are modern, and our manufacturing processes are substantially automated.  While we believe that our network of manufacturing facilities and third party manufacturers is sufficient to meet current and reasonably anticipated manufacturing requirements, we continue to identify opportunities to make significant improvements in capacity, technology and productivity.  To capitalize on innovation and other supply chain benefits, we continue to utilize a network of third-party manufacturers on a global basis, including an increased percentage of volume in Asia/Pacific to support our growth.



We have established a global distribution network designed to meet the changing demands of our customers while maintaining service levels.  We are continuously evaluating and adjusting this physical distribution network.  We have continued to establish regional distribution centers, including those maintained by third parties, strategically positioned throughout the world in order to facilitate efficient delivery of our products to our customers.



The principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are essential oils, alcohols and specialty chemicals.  We also purchase packaging components that are manufactured to our design specifications.  Procurement of materials for all manufacturing facilities is generally made on a global basis through our Global Supplier Relations department.  We are making a concentrated effort in supplier rationalization with the specific objective of reducing costs, increasing innovation and speed to market and improving quality.  In addition, we continue to focus on supply sourcing within the region of manufacture to allow for improved supply chain efficiencies.  As a result of sourcing initiatives, there is increased dependency on certain suppliers, but we believe that our portfolio of these suppliers has adequate resources and facilities to overcome most unforeseen interruptions of supply.  In the past, we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of essential raw materials and currently believe we have adequate sources of supply for virtually all components of our products.



We are continually benchmarking the performance of the supply chain and will change suppliers, and adjust our distribution networks and manufacturing footprint based upon the changing needs of the business.  As we integrate acquired brands, we continually seek new ways to leverage our production and sourcing capabilities to improve our overall supply chain performance.



Competition



The skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care businesses are characterized by vigorous competition throughout the world.  Brand recognition, quality, performance, availability and price are some of the factors that impact consumers’ choices among competing products and brands.  Advertising, promotion, merchandising, the pace and timing of new product introductions, line extensions and the quality of in-store demonstrations also have a significant impact on consumers’ buying decisions.  With our numerous brands, sold in various channels, we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products.  We compete against a number of companies, some of which have substantially greater resources than we do.



Our principal competitors consist of large, well-known, multinational manufacturers and marketers of skin care, makeup, fragrance and hair care products, most of which market and sell their products under multiple brand names.  They include, among others, L’Oreal S.A.; Shiseido Company, Ltd.; Beiresdorf AG; LVMH Moët Hennessey Louis Vuitton; Coty, Inc.; The Procter & Gamble Company; and Avon Products, Inc.  We also face competition from a number of independent brands, as well as some retailers that have developed their own beauty brands.  Certain of our competitors also have ownership interests in retailers that are customers of ours.



Trademarks, Patents and Copyrights



We own the trademark rights used in connection with the manufacturing, marketing, distribution and sale of our products both in the United States and in the other principal countries where such products are sold, including Estée Lauder, Clinique, Aramis, Prescriptives, Lab Series, Origins, MžAžC, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, Aveda, Jo Malone, Bumble and bumble, Darphin, American Beauty, Flirt!, GoodSkin Labs, grassroots research labs, Ojon, Smashbox, and Osaio, and the names of many of the products sold under these brands.  We are the exclusive worldwide licensee for fragrances, cosmetics and/or related products for Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan New York, DKNY, Kiton, Michael Kors, Tom Ford, Coach, Dr. Andrew Weil, Ermenegildo Zegna, Marni, Aerin and Tory Burch.  For further discussion on license arrangements, including their duration, see“Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – License Arrangements.”  We protect our trademarks in the United States and significant markets worldwide.  We consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business.



A number of our products incorporate patented, patent-pending or proprietary technology.  In addition, several products and packaging for such products are covered by design patents or copyrights.  While we consider these patents and copyrights, and the protection thereof, to be important, no single patent or copyright, or group of patents or copyrights, is considered material to the conduct of our business.

Employees



At June 30, 2013, we had approximately 40,200 full-time employees worldwide (including demonstrators at points of sale who are employed by us), of whom approximately 12,500 are employed in the United States and Canada.  None of our employees in the United States is covered by a collective bargaining agreement.  A limited number of employees outside of the United States are covered by a works council agreement or other syndicate arrangements.



Government Regulation



We and our products are subject to regulation by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal Trade Commission in the United States, as well as by various other federal, state, local and international regulatory authorities and the regulatory authorities in the countries in which our products are produced or sold.  Such regulations principally relate to the ingredients, manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing, shipment, disposal and safety of our products.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with such regulations, as well as with applicable federal, state, local and international and other countries’ rules and regulations governing the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment or that relate to climate change.  There are no significant capital expenditures for environmental control or climate change matters either planned in the current year or expected in the near future.



Seasonality



Our results of operations in total, by region and by product category, are subject to seasonal fluctuations, with net sales in the first half of the fiscal year typically being slightly higher than in the second half of the fiscal year.  The higher net sales in the first half of the fiscal year are attributable to the increased levels of purchasing by retailers for the holiday selling season.  Many of our customers that are retailers follow a 4-4-5 retail calendar which may influence the amount and timing of their order placement and receipt of goods in any fiscal quarter.  In a traditional 4-4-5 retail calendar, each fiscal quarter is comprised of two 4-week periods and one 5-week period, with one extra week in one quarter every seven years.  As a result, our customers’ retail quarter-end and our fiscal quarter-end may be different by up to six days.  Fluctuations in net sales and operating income in total and by geographic region and product category in any fiscal quarter may be attributable to the level and scope of new product introductions.  Additionally, gross margins and operating expenses are impacted on a quarter-by-quarter basis by variations in our launch calendar and the timing of promotions, including purchase with purchase and gift with purchase promotions.
