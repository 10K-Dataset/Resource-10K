ITEM 1. BUSINESS

The Company.Kellogg Company,
founded in 1906 and incorporated in Delaware in 1922, and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and marketing of ready-to-eat cereal and convenience foods.

The address of the principal business office of Kellogg Company is One Kellogg Square, P.O. Box 3599, Battle Creek, Michigan 49016-3599. Unless otherwise specified or indicated by the context,
“Kellogg,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Kellogg Company, its divisions and subsidiaries.

Financial Information About Segments.Information on segments is located in Note 16 within Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements.

Principal
Products.Our principal products are ready-to-eat cereals and convenience foods, such as cookies, crackers, toaster pastries, cereal bars, fruit-flavored snacks, frozen waffles and
veggie foods. These products were, as of February 28, 2012, manufactured by us in 17 countries and marketed in more than 180 countries. Our cereal products are generally marketed under theKellogg’sname and are sold
principally to the grocery trade through direct sales forces for resale to consumers. We use broker and distributor arrangements for certain products. We also generally use these, or similar arrangements, in less-developed market areas or in those
market areas outside of our focus.

We also market cookies, crackers, and other convenience foods, under brands such asKellogg’s, Keebler,
Cheez-It, Murray, AustinandFamous Amos,to supermarkets in the United States through a direct store-door (DSD) delivery system, although other distribution methods are also used.

Additional information pertaining to the relative sales of our products for the years 2009 through 2011 is located in Note 16 within Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, which are included herein under Part II, Item 8.

Raw
Materials.Agricultural commodities, including corn, wheat, soy bean oil, sugar and cocoa, are the principal raw materials used in our products. Cartonboard, corrugated, and plastic are
the principal packaging materials used by us. We continually monitor world supplies and prices of such commodities (which include such packaging materials), as well as government trade policies. The cost of such commodities may fluctuate widely due
to government policy and regulation, weather conditions, climate change or other unforeseen circumstances. Continuous efforts are made to maintain and improve the quality and supply of such commodities for purposes of our short-term and long-term
requirements.

The principal ingredients in the products produced by us in the United States include corn grits, wheat and wheat derivatives, oats,
rice, cocoa and chocolate, soybeans and soybean derivatives, various fruits, sweeteners, flour, vegetable oils, dairy products, eggs, and other filling ingredients, which are obtained from various sources. Most of these commodities are purchased
principally from sources in the United States.

We enter into long-term contracts for the commodities described in this section and purchase these
items on the open market, depending on our view of possible price fluctuations, supply levels, and our relative negotiating power. While the cost of some of these commodities has, and may continue to, increase over time, we believe that we will be
able to purchase an adequate supply of these items as needed. As further discussed herein under Part II, Item 7A, we also use commodity futures and options to hedge some of our costs.

Raw materials and packaging needed for internationally based operations are available in adequate supply and are sometimes imported from countries other than those
where used in manufacturing.

Natural gas and propane are the primary sources of energy used to power processing ovens at major domestic and
international facilities, although certain locations may use oil or propane on a back-up or alternative basis. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products. As further discussed herein
under Part II, Item 7A, we use over-the-counter commodity price swaps to hedge some of our natural gas costs.

Trademarks and Technology.Generally, our products are marketed under trademarks we own. Our principal trademarks are
our housemarks, brand names, slogans, and designs related to cereals and convenience foods manufactured and marketed by us, and we also grant licenses to third parties to use these marks on various goods.

The trademarks listed above, among others, when taken as a whole, are important to our business. Certain individual trademarks are also important to our business.
Depending on the jurisdiction, trademarks are generally valid as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic. Registrations of trademarks can also generally be
renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use.

We consider that, taken as a whole, the rights under our various patents, which expire from
time to time, are a valuable asset, but we do not believe that our businesses are materially dependent on any single patent or group of related patents. Our activities under licenses or other franchises or concessions which we hold are similarly a
valuable asset, but are not believed to be material.

Seasonality.Demand for our products has generally been approximately level throughout the year, although some of our convenience foods have a bias for stronger demand in the second half of the year due to events
and holidays. We also custom-bake cookies for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., which are principally sold in the first quarter of the year.






Working Capital.Although terms vary around the world and by business types, in the United States we generally have required payment for goods sold eleven or sixteen days subsequent to the date of invoice as 2% 10/net
11 or 1% 15/net 16. Receipts from goods sold, supplemented as required by borrowings, provide for our payment of dividends, repurchases of our common stock, capital expansion, and for other operating expenses and working capital needs.

Customers.Our largest customer,
Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated net sales during 2011, comprised principally of sales within the United States. At December 31, 2011, approximately 18% of our consolidated receivables
balance and 28% of our U.S. receivables balance was comprised of amounts owed by Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates. No other customer accounted for greater than 10% of net sales in 2011. During 2011, our top five customers, collectively,
including Wal-Mart, accounted for approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales and approximately 46% of U.S. net sales. There has been significant worldwide consolidation in the grocery industry in recent years and we believe that this trend
is likely to continue. Although the loss of any large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profits, we do not anticipate that this will occur to a significant extent due to the consumer demand for our
products and our relationships with our customers. Our products have been generally sold through our own sales forces and through broker and distributor arrangements, and have been generally resold to consumers in retail stores, restaurants, and
other food service establishments.

Backlog.For the most part, orders are filled within a few days of receipt and are subject to cancellation at any time prior to shipment. The backlog of any unfilled orders at December 31, 2011 and
January 1, 2011 was not material to us.

Competition.We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, intense competition for sales of all of our principal products in our major product categories, both domestically and internationally. Our
products compete with advertised and branded products of a similar nature as well as unadvertised and private label products, which are typically distributed at lower prices, and generally with other food products. Principal methods and factors of
competition include new product introductions, product quality, taste, convenience, nutritional value, price, advertising and promotion.

Research and Development.Research to support and expand the use of our existing products and to develop new food products is
carried on at the W. K. Kellogg Institute for Food and Nutrition Research in Battle Creek, Michigan, and at other locations around the world. Our expenditures for research and development were approximately (in millions): 2011-$192; 2010-$187;
2009-$181.

Regulation.Our activities in the
United States are subject to regulation by various government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, Federal Trade Commission and the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Labor, as well as voluntary regulation by other bodies.
Various state and local agencies also regulate our activities. Other agencies and bodies outside of the United States, including those of the European Union and various countries, states and municipalities, also regulate our activities.

Environmental Matters.Our
facilities are subject to various U.S. and foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations regarding the release of material into the environment and the protection of the environment in other ways. We are not a party to any material
proceedings arising under these regulations. We believe that compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations will not materially affect our consolidated financial condition or our competitive position.

Employees.At December 31,
2011, we had approximately 30,700 employees.
