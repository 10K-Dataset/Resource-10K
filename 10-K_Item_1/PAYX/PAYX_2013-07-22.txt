By offering ancillary services that leverage the information gathered in the base payroll processing service, we are able to provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow employers to expand their employee benefits offerings at an affordable cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay period, and utilization of ancillary services.



At Paychex, innovative technology meets superior customer service.  The integration of service and technology allows us to meet our clients' diverse needs by providing them information and products when, where, and how they want it.  Our Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") solutions, operating in the cloud, allow us to offer such versatility.  Our Paychex Mobile Applications add greater value and convenience for our clients and their employees by allowing them instant access and increased productivity.  Our mobile apps are available for iPad®and AndroidTMtablets and smartphones, and allow our clients and their employees to have full access to our products, offering diverse capabilities for both the employer and employee. During the fiscal year ended












May 31, 2013 ("fiscal 2013"), we introduced an industry-leading, web-based report center and robust report writer.  This provides a one-stop shop for standard or on-demand reporting needs, ad-hoc and customized reporting, data-extract templates, and more.



We are integrating our leading-edge technology and mobility platform with our world class customer service through the Paychex Next Generation suite of innovative products.  This technology creates an integrated workforce management tool for our clients by bringing together the services those clients need, including our payroll products and various human resource and employee benefit management services.

Payroll

Payroll processing is the foundation of our service portfolio. Our payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal accounting records and management reports; preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations. Our payroll services support the small business market through our core payroll and SurePayroll, Inc. ("SurePayroll") products.  Our core payroll clients can opt for our full-service customer service model through our branch operations or use Paychex Online, our secure Internet portal, which offers a suite of self-service, interactive services twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. These services include Paychex Online Payroll®, Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger Reporting Service. Using these services, clients can communicate payroll information, access current and historical payroll information, and transfer payroll information calculated by us to their general ledger accounting software, eliminating manual entries and improving the accuracy of bookkeeping.  In addition, our SurePayroll SaaS solution offers "do-it-yourself," self-service and mobile applications for small business.

Mid-market companies typically have more sophisticated payroll and benefits needs, and are primarily serviced through our Major Market Services ("MMS") payroll product.  We offer a SaaS solution to meet the payroll and human resource administrative needs of our MMS clients. This allows our mid-market payroll product to be integrated with various Internet-based services offered to assist clients with their administrative human resource and payroll needs through every step of the employee life cycle. Ancillary services particularly beneficial to our MMS clients include the following:

•Paychex HR Online, our Internet-based human resource management system, offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits, personnel information, and critical human resource compliance and reporting needs. In addition, its self-service features allow for better communication between management and employees.

•BeneTrac, our employee benefits management and administration system, provides our clients a simple, accurate, and cost-effective solution for streamlined benefits management.

MMS clients also have the option to select from a number of á la carte payroll and human resource ancillary services or opt for our comprehensive human resource and payroll outsourcing solution, Paychex HR Solutions. This flexibility allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their particular needs.

Payroll tax administration services:Our payroll tax administration services (including Taxpay®) provide accurate preparation and timely filing of quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies (federal, state, and local). In connection with these services, we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections from clients, with some items extending to 90 days. We handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and interest disputes, and we are subject to cash penalties imposed by tax or regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under payment of taxes.

Employee payment services:Our employee payment services provide the employer the option of paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a check drawn on a Paychex account (Readychex®), or a check drawn on the employer’s












account and electronically signed by us. For the first three methods, we electronically collect net payroll from the clients’ bank accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide payment to the employees on payday. Our Readychex service provides a cost-effective solution that offers the benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation for employers.

Regulatory compliance services:We offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to comply with federal and state requirements to report information on newly hired employees. This information aids the government in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims. Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies, including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

Sales and Marketing

We market our services primarily through our direct sales force based in the metropolitan markets we serve, with sales representatives specializing within our portfolio of services. Our sales representatives are also supported by marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and telemarketing programs. In recent years, we have increased our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services and products to both new clients and our existing client base.

In fiscal 2013, we added new territories and focused on market segmentation in payroll and retirement services.  Within payroll, we differentiate the markets we serve between the small business market and mid-market companies. Within retirement services, we expanded our sales efforts by creating a dedicated, wholesale sales force focused solely on enhancing our relationships with financial advisors.

In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we utilize relationships with existing clients, certified public accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client referrals. Approximately 60% of our new core payroll clients (excluding business acquisitions) come from these referral sources.

We recently celebrated the ten year anniversary of our partnership with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll provider for its AICPA Business SolutionsTMProgram.  More than half of the CPA firms in the U.S. are enrolled and actively participating in the Paychex Partner Program from AICPA Business Solutions.   Our current partnership agreement with the AICPA is in place through September 2016.  We enhanced our relationships with CPAs by partnering with various state CPA society organizations.  In addition, we recently created a dedicated business development group to drive sales in the banking and franchise channels.

Our website available atwww.paychex.com, which includes online payroll sales presentations and service and product information, is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and new sales, while complementing the efforts of our direct sales force. This online tool allows us to market to clients and prospective clients in other geographical areas where we do not have a direct sales presence. In addition, our insurance services website available atwww.paychexinsurance.comprovides information to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry, and generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact with one of our professional insurance agents.

In addition, Advantage Payroll Services Inc. (“Advantage”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex, Inc., has license agreements with independently owned associate offices (“Associates”), which are responsible for selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing certain operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and payroll tax administration services. The marketing and selling by the Associates is conducted under their own logos.

Paychex also builds on its reputation as an expert in the payroll and human resources industry by providing education and assistance to clients and other interested parties. We provide free webinars, white papers, and other information on our website to aid existing and prospective clients with the impact of regulatory changes. We track current regulatory issues that impact the small business community and provide a monthly regulatory update. Our newly redesigned Paychex Accountant Knowledge Center is a free online resource available through our website that brings valuable information and time-saving online tools to accounting professionals.  During fiscal 2013, in an effort to help entrepreneurs and small-business owners achieve success, we launched a new and improved website,BuildMyBiz.com, that provides tools and resources for starting, growing, and managing a business.

A section of both the Paychex website,www.paychex.com, and our insurance services website,www.paychexinsurance.com,is designated to the topic of health care reform to provide answers, information, and solutions that employers need to prepare for and take action relating to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 ("PPACA") and the Health Care and Education












Reconciliation Act of 2010. Paychex is positioned to assist our clients and their employees as they navigate the complexity of this legislation.

Markets and Competition

We remain focused on servicing small- to medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we believe exists in the markets we serve. Industry data indicates there are approximately12 millionbusinesses in the geographic markets that we currently serve within the U.S. Of those businesses, greater than 99% have fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and target market.

We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the U.S. and in Germany. We utilize service agreements and arrangements with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any time or upon relatively short notice. Forfiscal 2013, client retention reached record levels, in excess of 81% of our beginning client base. No single client has a material impact on total service revenue or results of operations.

The composition of the U.S. market and the client base we serve by number of employees is as follows:

Business size(Number of employees)Estimatedmarket  distribution(1)Paychex, Inc. distributionof client base1-483%42%5-1913%40%20-493%12%50-991%4%100+—%2%



(1)Based on current available market data from Dun & Bradstreet.

The market for payroll processing and human resource services is highly competitive and fragmented. We have one primary national competitor and we also compete with other national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us.

In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our Human Resource Services also compete with a variety of providers of human resource services, such as retirement services companies, insurance companies, and human resources and benefits consulting firms.

Competition in the payroll processing and human resource services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness; product quality and reputation, including ease of use and accessibility of technology; breadth of service and product offering; and price. We believe we are competitive in each of these areas.

Software Maintenance and Development

The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human resource services to our clients. We are continually engaged in developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our clients and the marketplace.

We continue to enhance our Paychex Next Generation platform, with its suite of innovative products, as we believe it is a key building block to our future success. We also continue to add more capabilities to our mobility applications.

Employees

As ofMay 31, 2013, we employed approximately 12,400 people.  None of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements.












Intellectual Property

We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including, but not limited to, confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material importance to us.

Seasonality

There is no significant seasonality to our business. However, during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients, and new Paychex HR Solutions worksite employees tends to be higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily because many new clients prefer to start using our services at the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end transaction processing and client funds activity are traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors, our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in the third quarter.
