    and Products



We offer a comprehensive portfolio of services and products that
    allow our clients to meet their diverse payroll and human
    resource needs. These include:



•payroll processing;•payroll tax administration services;•employee payment services;•regulatory compliance services (new-hire reporting and
    garnishment processing);•Paychex HR Solutions;•retirement services administration;•insurance services;•eServices; and•other human resource services and products.



By offering ancillary services that leverage the information
    gathered in the base payroll processing service, we are able to
    provide comprehensive outsourcing services that allow employers
    to expand their employee benefits offerings at an affordable
    cost. We mainly earn our revenue through recurring fees for
    services performed. Service revenue is primarily driven by the
    number of clients, checks or transactions per client per pay
    period, and utilization of ancillary services.



Payroll



Payroll processing is the foundation of our service portfolio.
    Our payroll service includes the calculation, preparation, and
    delivery of employee payroll checks; production of internal
    accounting records and management reports; preparation of
    federal, state, and local payroll tax returns; and collection
    and remittance of clients’ payroll obligations. Our payroll
    services are provided through either our core payroll or Major
    Market Services (“MMS”) and are made available to
    clients via traditional or Internet-based methods.



Paychex Online is our secure Internet site, which offers core
    payroll clients a suite of self-service, interactive services
    and products twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. These
    include Paychex Online
    Payroll®,

    Internet Time Sheet, Paychex Online Reports, and General Ledger
    Reporting Service. Using these services, clients can





communicate payroll information, access current and historical
    payroll information, and transfer payroll information calculated
    by us to their general ledger accounting software, eliminating
    manual entries and improving the accuracy of bookkeeping. More
    than one-half of our clients are currently utilizing some form
    of Paychex Online payroll service.



During the fiscal year ended May 31, 2011 (“fiscal
    2011”), we acquired SurePayroll, Inc.
    (“SurePayroll”), a provider of software-as-a-service
    payroll processing for small businesses. This acquisition
    expands our product offering for small business clients to
    self-service and mobile applications.



Major Market Services:MMS primarily
    targets companies that have more sophisticated payroll and
    benefits needs. We currently offer this service in all of our
    significant markets. Our proprietary MMS software,
    Preview®,

    provides a powerful payroll solution and allows smooth
    integration with other Paychex service offerings. Preview can be
    used as anon-site,PC-based system or via a secure web-hosted environment.



We offer a software-as-a-service solution to meet the payroll
    and human resource administrative needs of our MMS clients. This
    allows Preview to be integrated with various Internet-based
    services offered to assist clients with their administrative
    human resource and payroll needs through every step of the
    employee life cycle. Ancillary services particularly beneficial
    to our MMS clients include the following:



•Paychex HR Online, our Internet-based human resource management
    system, offers powerful tools for managing employee benefits,
    personnel information, and critical human resource compliance
    and reporting needs. In addition, its self-service features
    allow for better communication between management and employees.•BeneTrac, our employee benefits management and administration
    system, provides our MMS clients a simple, accurate, and
    cost-effective solution for streamlined benefits management.•Paychex Time and Labor Online makes the time and attendance
    process more efficient. This solution can reduce time spent on
    preparing timesheets, minimize redundant data entry, increase
    awareness of critical labor information, and aid in compliance
    with federal time recording requirements.•Paychex Expense Manager is an integrated payroll and expense
    management solution that allows clients to control discretionary
    spending while giving employees an easy-to-use, secure tool to
    prepare and submit expense reports online.•Applicant tracking, offered through our partnership with Taleo
    Corporation, provides our MMS clients with a tool to manage
    their recruiting process in order to better hire and retain
    talented employees.



MMS clients can select Paychex One-Source Solutions, which
    seamlessly integrates Preview, Paychex Time and Labor Online,
    and Paychex HR Online applications through a single, web-based
    client portal. MMS clients also have the option to select from a
    number of á la carte payroll and human resource ancillary
    services or opt for our comprehensive human resource and payroll
    outsourcing solution, Paychex HR Solutions. This flexibility
    allows our clients to define the solution that best meets their
    particular needs.



Payroll tax administration services:As
    of May 31, 2011, 95% of our clients utilized our payroll
    tax administration services (including
    Taxpay®),

    which provide accurate preparation and timely filing of
    quarterly and year-end tax returns, as well as the electronic
    transfer of funds to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies
    (federal, state, and local). In connection with these services,
    we electronically collect payroll taxes from clients’ bank
    accounts, typically on payday, prepare and file the applicable
    tax returns, and remit taxes to the applicable tax or regulatory
    agencies on the respective due dates. These taxes are typically
    paid between one and 30 days after receipt of collections
    from clients, with some items extending to 90 days. We
    handle regulatory correspondence, amendments, and penalty and
    interest disputes, and we are subject to cash penalties imposed
    by tax or regulatory agencies for late filings and late or under
    payment of taxes.



Employee payment services:As of
    May 31, 2011, 79% of our clients utilized our employee
    payment services, which provide the employer the option of
    paying their employees by direct deposit, payroll debit card, a
    check drawn on a Paychex account
    (Readychex®),

    or a check drawn on the employer’s account and
    electronically signed by us. For the first three methods, we
    electronically collect net payroll from the clients’ bank
    accounts, typically one business day before payday, and provide
    payment to the employees on payday. Our flexible payment





options provide a cost-effective solution that offers the
    benefit of convenient, one-step payroll account reconciliation
    for employers.



Regulatory compliance services:We
    offer new-hire reporting services, which enable clients to
    comply with federal and state requirements to report information
    on newly hired employees. This information aids the government
    in enforcing child support orders and minimizes fraudulent
    unemployment and workers’ compensation insurance claims.
    Our garnishment processing service provides deductions from
    employees’ pay, forwards payments to third-party agencies,
    including those that require electronic payments, and tracks the
    obligations to fulfillment. These services enable employers to
    comply with legal requirements and reduce the risk of penalties.

    management manuals, and personnel and required regulatory forms.
    These products are designed to simplify clients’ office
    processes and enhance their employee benefits programs.



Sales and
    Marketing



We market our services primarily through our direct sales force
    based in the metropolitan markets we serve, with sales
    representatives specializing within our portfolio of services.
    For the year ending May 31, 2012 (“fiscal 2012”),
    our sales force is expected to total approximately 2,400
    representatives. Our sales representatives are also supported by
    marketing, advertising, public relations, trade shows, and
    telemarketing programs. We have grown and expect to continue to
    grow our direct sales force. In recent years, we have increased
    our emphasis on the selling of ancillary services and products
    to both new clients and our existing client base.



In addition to our direct selling and marketing efforts, we
    utilize relationships with existing clients, certified public
    accountants (“CPAs”), and banks for new client
    referrals. More than 60% of our new core payroll clients
    (excluding acquisitions) come from these referral sources. To
    further enhance our strong relationship with CPAs, we have
    partnered with the American Institute of Certified Public
    Accountants (“AICPA”) as the preferred payroll
    provider for its AICPA Business Solutions Partner Program since
    2003. This long-standing strategic alliance has been extended to
    September 2016.



Our website atwww.paychex.com, which includes online
    payroll sales presentations and service and product information,
    is a cost-efficient tool that serves as a source of leads and
    new sales while complementing the efforts of our direct sales
    force. This online tool allows us to market to clients in more
    geographically remote areas. In addition, our insurance services
    website atwww.paychexinsurance.comprovides information
    to help small businesses navigate the insurance industry, and
    generates leads by allowing interested parties to get in contact
    with one of our professional insurance agents.



In addition, Advantage Payroll Services Inc.
    (“Advantage”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Paychex,
    Inc., has license agreements with independently owned associate
    offices (“Associates”), which are responsible for
    selling and marketing Advantage payroll services and performing
    certain operational functions, while Paychex and Advantage
    provide all centralized back-office payroll processing and
    payroll tax administration services. The marketing and selling
    by the Associates is conducted under their own logos.



Markets
    and Competition



Industry data indicates there are approximately ten million
    employers in the geographic markets that we currently serve
    within the U.S. Of those employers, approximately 99% have
    fewer than 100 employees and are our primary customers and
    target market. We remain focused on servicing small- to
    medium-sized businesses based upon the growth potential that we
    believe exists in this market segment.



We serve a diverse base of small- to medium-sized clients
    operating in a broad range of industries located throughout the
    U.S. As of May 31, 2011, we serviced approximately
    564,000 clients. We utilize service agreements and arrangements
    with clients that are generally terminable by the client at any
    time or upon relatively short notice. For fiscal 2011, client
    retention was approximately 79% of our beginning client base, up
    two percentage points from the fiscal year ended May 31,
    2010 (“fiscal 2010”). Clients lost in fiscal 2011
    decreased 9% compared to fiscal





2010, largely due to fewer clients going out of business or
    having no employees. No single client has a material impact on
    total service revenue or results of operations.



The composition of the U.S. market and the client base we
    serve by number of employees is as follows:

(1)Based on currently available market data from Dun &
    Bradstreet.



The market for payroll processing and human resource services is
    highly competitive and fragmented. Our primary national
    competitor,
    ADP®(“Automatic Data Processing, Inc.”), is the largest
    U.S. third-party provider of payroll processing and human
    resource services in terms of revenue. We compete with other
    national, regional, local, and online service providers, all of
    which we believe have significantly smaller client bases than us.



In addition to traditional payroll processing and human resource
    service providers, we compete with in-house payroll and human
    resource systems and departments. Payroll and human resource
    systems and software are sold by many vendors. Our Human
    Resource Services also compete with a variety of providers of
    human resource services, such as retirement services companies,
    insurance companies, and human resources and benefits consulting
    firms.



Competition in the payroll processing and human resource
    services industry is primarily based on service responsiveness,
    product quality and reputation, breadth of service and product
    offering, and price. We believe we are competitive in each of
    these areas.



Software
    Maintenance and Development



The ever-changing mandates of federal, state, and local tax and
    regulatory agencies require us to regularly update the
    proprietary software we utilize to provide payroll and human
    resource services to our clients. We are continually engaged in
    developing enhancements to and the maintenance of our various
    software platforms to meet the changing requirements of our
    clients and the marketplace.



In fiscal 2010, we completed implementation of an enhanced
    platform for our core processing capability, which allows us to
    leverage efficiencies in our processes and continue to provide
    excellent customer service. Over the next few years, we will
    expand this platform to additional service offerings.



Employees



As of May 31, 2011, we employed approximately
    12,400 people. None of our employees were covered by
    collective bargaining agreements.



Intellectual
    Property



We own or license and use a number of trademarks, trade names,
    copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, computer programs and
    software, and other intellectual property rights. Taken as a
    whole, our intellectual property rights are material to the
    conduct of our business. Where it is determined to be
    appropriate, we take measures to protect our intellectual
    property rights, including, but not limited to,
    confidentiality/non-disclosure agreements or policies with
    employees, vendors, and others; license agreements with
    licensees and licensors of intellectual property; and
    registration of certain trademarks. We believe that the
    “Paychex” name, trademark, and logo are of material
    importance to us.





Seasonality



There is no significant seasonality to our business. However,
    during our third fiscal quarter, which ends in February, the
    number of new payroll clients, new retirement services clients,
    and new Paychex HR Solutions worksite employees tends to be
    higher than during the rest of the fiscal year, primarily
    because a majority of new clients begin using our services in
    the beginning of a calendar year. In addition, calendar year-end
    transaction processing and client funds activity are
    traditionally higher during our third fiscal quarter due to
    clients paying year-end bonuses and requesting additional
    year-end services. Historically, as a result of these factors,
    our total revenue has been slightly higher in our third fiscal
    quarter, with greater sales commission expenses also reported in
    this quarter.
