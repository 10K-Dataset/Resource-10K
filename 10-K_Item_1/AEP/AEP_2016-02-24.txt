ITEM 1.   BUSINESS





GENERAL



Overview and Description of Material Subsidiaries



AEP was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in 1925.  It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly, all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and varying percentages of other subsidiaries.



The service areas of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia.  Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive distribution facilities in the territories served.  The public utility subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their retail customers. Restructuring laws in Michigan, Ohio and the ERCOT area of Texas have caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail customers.  In Ohio, AEP’s regulated utility operates its distribution and transmission assets while its former generation assets are owned and operated by affiliates.



The member companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in the AEP System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and transportation and handling of fuel.  The companies of the AEP System also obtain certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial, legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider, AEPSC.



As of December 31,2015, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 17,405 employees.  Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has no employees.  The material subsidiaries of AEP are:

FINANCING



General



Companies within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital needs.  Short-term debt may also be used to finance acquisitions, construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such needs can be financed with long-term debt.  In recent history, short-term funding needs have been provided for by cash on hand, borrowing under AEP’s revolving credit agreements and AEP’s commercial paper program.  Funds are made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program.  Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to provide liquidity.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the2015Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information concerning short-term funding and access to bank lines of credit, commercial paper and capital markets.



AEP’s revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program) include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility, including a maximum debt/capital test.  In addition, the acceleration of AEP’s payment obligations, or the obligations of certain of its major subsidiaries, prior to maturity under any other agreement or instrument relating to debt outstanding in excess of $50 million, would cause an event of default under these credit agreements.  As of December 31,2015, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.  With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before










termination of the agreements.  A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP or one of its significant subsidiaries would be considered an immediate termination event.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the2015Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Financial Condition for additional information with respect to AEP’s credit agreements.



AEP’s subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional financing arrangements, such as securitization financings and leasing arrangements, including the leasing of coal transportation equipment and facilities.





ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER MATTERS



General



AEP subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities.  The environmental issues that management believes are potentially material to the AEP System are outlined below.



Clean Water Act Requirements



Operations for AEP subsidiaries are subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to appropriate permits, and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for use in power plants.  In 2014, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting forth standards for existing power plants that is intended to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms pinned against a plant’s cooling water intake screen (impingement) or entrained in the cooling water.  The standards affect all plants withdrawing more than two million gallons of cooling water per day and establish specific intake design and intake velocity standards meant to allow fish to avoid or escape impingement.  Compliance with this standard is required within eight years of the effective date of the final rule.  The standard for entrainment for existing facilities requires a site-specific evaluation of the available measures for reducing entrainment.  Challenges to this final rule have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and additional changes could be made to this rule as a result of review by the court.



In November 2015, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to update the technology-based standards that govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the Clean Water Act’s National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program.  For additional information, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues.



Coal Ash Regulation



AEP’s operations produce a number of different coal combustion products, including fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum and other materials.  Effective October 2015, the Federal EPA adopted a rule to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals, including fly ash and bottom ash generated at coal-fired electric generating units.  The final rule requires certain standards for location, groundwater monitoring and dam stability to be met at landfills and certain surface impoundments at operating facilities on a schedule spanning approximately four years after publication of the final rule in the Federal Register.  If existing disposal facilities cannot meet these standards, they will be required to close, but the time frame for closure may be extended if adequate alternative disposal options are not available.  For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate the disposal and beneficial re-use of coal combustion residuals and the potential impact on operations, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Coal Combustion Residual Rule.



Clean Air Act Requirements



The CAA establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air emissions.  The major CAA programs affecting AEP’s power plants are described below.  The states implement and administer many of these programs and could impose additional or more stringent requirements.










AEP has made significant long-term investments in environmental controls to reduce air emissions from its power plants. Between 2000 and 2015, AEP invested approximately $8.1 billion in environmental controls, primarily related to CAA, that have significantly reduced emissions.  During the same time period and including our projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of mercury to have been reduced by approximately 85%.  Since 1990 and including our projections through 2017, AEP expects its emissions of SO2and NOxto have been reduced by approximately 90% and 85% respectively.



The Acid Rain Program



The 1990 Amendments to the CAA include a cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2emissions from power plants.  By 2000, the program established a nationwide cap on power plant SO2emissions of 8.9 million tons per year and required further reductions in 2010.  The 1990 Amendments also contain requirements for power plants to reduce NOxemissions through the use of available combustion controls.



The success of the SO2cap-and-trade program encouraged the Federal EPA and the states to use it as a model for other emission reduction programs.  AEP continues to meet its obligations under the Acid Rain Program through the installation of controls, use of alternate fuels and participation in the emissions allowance markets.  Subsequent programs developed by the Federal EPA have imposed more stringent SO2and NOxemission reduction requirements than the Acid Rain Program on many AEP facilities.  Additional controls and other actions have been taken to achieve compliance with these programs at these facilities.



National Ambient Air Quality Standards



The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review the available scientific data for criteria pollutants periodically and establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety margin.  The Federal EPA also can list additional pollutants and develop concentration levels for them.  These concentration levels are known as national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).



Each state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment areas) and those that do not (nonattainment areas).  Each state must develop a state implementation plan (SIP) to bring nonattainment areas into compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment areas.  All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for approval.  If a state fails to develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA develops and implements a plan.  As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS and establishes new concentration levels, the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop new SIPs.  In 2008, the Federal EPA issued revised NAAQS for both ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5).  The PM2.5standard was remanded by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, and a new rule was signed by the administrator in December 2012 that lowered the annual standard.  A new ozone standard was adopted in 2015.  The Federal EPA also adopted a new short-term standard for SO2in 2010, a lower standard for NOxin 2010, and confirmed the existing standard for lead in 2014.  The existing standard for carbon monoxide was retained in 2011.  The states are in the process of developing new SIPs for the SO2, PM2.5and ozone standards, which could result in more stringent emission limitations being imposed on AEP facilities.



In 2005, the Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), which required additional reductions in SO2and NOxemissions from power plants and assists states developing new SIPs to meet the NAAQS.   In August 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule to replace CAIR (the Cross State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)) that contains more stringent requirements to control SO2and NOxemissions from fossil fuel-fired electric generating units in 27 states and the District of Columbia.  Petitions for review were filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and CSAPR was vacated.  That decision was subsequently reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court and remanded back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for further proceedings.  The Federal EPA filed a motion to lift the stay and allow Phase I of CSAPR to take effect on January 1, 2015 and Phase II to take effect on January 1, 2017.  The court granted the Federal EPA’s motion, an interim final rule has been issued, and the court has remanded certain state budgets to Federal EPA for further rulemaking while the rule remains in effect.  Federal EPA has proposed more stringent NOxbudgets for 23 states during the 2017 ozone season.  For additional information regarding CSAPR, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.










Hazardous Air Pollutants



As a result of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, the Federal EPA investigated hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from the electric utility sector and submitted a report to Congress, identifying mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants as warranting further study.  In 2011, the Federal EPA issued a final rule setting Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards for new and existing coal and oil-fired utility units and New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for emissions from new and modified power plants.  Petitions for review of the MACT standards were denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, but in 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court determined that Federal EPA acted unreasonably in refusing to consider costs in determining if it was appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant emissions from electric generating units.  Federal EPA has issued a supplemental finding and the rule remains in effect.  For additional information regarding MACT, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.



Regional Haze



The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing impairment of visibility in these areas (Regional Haze program).  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how the CAA’s best available retrofit technology requirements will be applied to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power plants.



PSO is in the process of implementing a settlement with the Federal EPA in order to comply with the Regional Haze program requirements in Oklahoma.  Federal EPA issued a proposed Federal Implementation Plan for Arkansas in 2015.  For additional information regarding CAVR and the Regional Haze program requirements, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Clean Air Act Requirements.



Climate Change



AEP has taken action to reduce and offset CO


emissions from its generating fleet and expects CO


emissions from its operations to continue to decline due to the retirement of some of its coal-fired generation units, and actions taken to diversify the generation fleet and increase energy efficiency where there is regulatory support for such activities.  AEP’s total CO


emissions in 2015 (not including emissions from the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek Plants) were approximately 102.4 million metric tons, a  30% reduction from AEP’s 2005 CO


emissions of approximately 146 million metric tons.  Federal EPA has taken action to regulate CO


emissions from new and existing fossil fueled electric generating units under the existing provisions of the CAA.  For example, the Federal EPA published the Clean Power Plan in October 2015.  Such actions, including the Clean Power Plan, are being legally challenged by numerous parties and final regulatory outcomes remain uncertain.  In February 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay on the final Clean Power Plan, including all of the deadlines for submission of initial or final state plans.  The stay will remain in effect until a final decision is issued by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the U.S. Supreme Court considers any petition for review.



For additional information regarding the Federal EPA action taken to regulate CO


emissions, including the Clean Power Plan, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under the headings entitled Environmental Issues-Climate Change, CO


Regulation and Energy Policy.



Management expects emissions to continue to decline over time as AEP diversifies generating sources and operates fewer coal units.  The projected decline in coal-fired generation is due to a number of factors, including the ongoing cost of operating older units, the relative cost of coal and natural gas as fuel sources, increasing environmental regulations requiring significant capital investments and changing commodity market fundamentals.  Management’s strategy for this transformation includes diversifying AEP’s fuel portfolio and generating more electricity from natural gas, increasing energy efficiency and investing in renewable resources, where there is regulatory support.












AEP’s fossil fuel-fired generating units are large sources of CO2emissions.  If substantial additional CO2emission reductions are required, there will be significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs which would hasten the ultimate retirement of older, less-efficient, coal-fired units.  To the extent additional investments are made to reduce CO2emissions and receive regulatory approvals to increase rates, return on capital investment would have a positive effect on future earnings.  Prudently incurred capital investments made by AEP subsidiaries in rate-regulated jurisdictions to comply with legal requirements and benefit customers are generally included in rate base for recovery and earn a return on investment.  Management would expect these principles to apply to investments made to address new environmental requirements.  However, requests for rate increases reflecting these costs can have adverse effects because regulators could limit the amount or timing of increased costs that AEP would recover through higher rates. For sales of energy into competitive markets, however, there is no such recovery mechanism.



Renewable Sources of Energy



All of the states AEP serves (other than Kentucky and Tennessee) have established mandatory or voluntary programs to increase the use of energy efficiency, alternative energy, or renewable energy sources.



At the end of 2015, the AEP operating companies had long-term contracts for 2,031.5 MW of wind and 10.1 MW of solar power delivering renewable energy to the companies’ customers. In addition, I&M began construction on the first of four solar projects that will make up I&M’s 14.7 MW Clean Energy Solar Pilot Project (CESPP) that was approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.  599 MWs of recently-completed wind projects under contract for PSO were in service as of late 2015, and the remaining three projects associated with I&M’s CESPP projects are expected to begin deliveries in 2016.  This will result in a total of 2,655.3 MW of wind and solar in-service for AEP.  Management actively manages AEP’s compliance position and is on pace to meet the relevant requirements or benchmarks in each applicable jurisdiction.



The growth of AEP’s renewable portfolio reflects the company’s strategy to diversify its generation resources to provide clean energy options to customers that meet both energy and capacity needs.  In addition to gradually reducing AEP’s reliance on coal-fueled generating units, the growth of renewables and natural gas helps AEP to maintain a diversity of generation resources.



The Clean Power Plan effectively establishes a renewable portfolio standard for each of AEP’s states, creating additional opportunities for renewable growth. Independent of the Clean Power Plan, the integrated resource plans filed with state regulatory commissions by AEP’s regulated utility subsidiaries reflect AEP’s renewable strategy to balance reliability and cost with customers’ desire for clean energy in a carbon-constrained world.  The Company has committed significant capital investments to modernize the electric grid and integrate these new resources.  Transmission assets of the AEP System interconnect approximately 7,500 MW of renewable energy resources of third parties, and AEP’s transmission development initiatives are designed to facilitate the interconnection of additional renewable energy resources.



End Use Energy Efficiency



Beginning in 2008, AEP ramped up efforts to reduce energy consumption and peak demand through the introduction of additional energy efficiency and demand response programs.  These programs, commonly and collectively referred to as demand side management, were implemented in jurisdictions where appropriate cost recovery was available.  Since that time, AEP operating companies have implemented over 100 programs across the AEP service territory and in most of the states AEP serves.  For the period 2008 through 2015, these programs have reduced annual consumption by over 6.0 million megawatt hours and peak demand by over 1,500 MW.  AEP estimates that its operating companies spent approximately $875 million during that period  to achieve these levels.



Energy efficiency and demand reduction programs have received regulatory support in most of the states AEP serves, and appropriate cost recovery will be essential for AEP operating companies to continue and expand these consumer offerings. Appropriate recovery of program costs, lost revenues, and an opportunity to earn a reasonable return ensures that energy efficiency programs are considered equally with supply side investments.  The Clean Power Plan  could










provide additional opportunities for energy efficiency if states develop implementation plans that require energy efficiency.  AEP believes its experience providing robust energy efficiency programs in several states positions the company to be a cost-effective provider of these programs as states develop their implementation plans.



AEP is also developing and marketing a merchant distributed resource portfolio.  AEP’s newly-formed subsidiary, OnSite Partners LLC, works directly with wholesale and large retail customers to provide tailored solutions based upon market knowledge, technology innovations and deal structuring which may include distributed solar, wind, combined heat and power, energy storage, waste heat recovery, energy efficiency, peaking generation and other forms of cost reducing energy technologies.  OnSite Partners LLC pursues projects where a suitably termed power agreement is entered into with a credit-worthy counterparty.



Corporate Governance



In response to environmental issues and in connection with its assessment of AEP’s strategic plan, the Board of Directors continually reviews the risks posed by new environmental rules and requirements such as the Clean Power Plan that could accelerate the retirement of coal-fired generation assets.  The Board of Directors is informed of any new environmental regulations and proposed regulation or legislation that would affect the company.  The Board’s Committee on Directors and Corporate Governance oversees the company’s annual Corporate Accountability Report, which includes information about the company’s environmental, financial and social performance.



Other Environmental Issues and Matters



The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 imposes costs for environmental remediation upon owners and previous owners of sites, as well as transporters and generators of hazardous material disposed of at such sites.  See Note6to the financial statements entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies, included in the2015Annual Reports, under the heading entitled The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (Superfund) and State Remediation for further information.

Management continues to refine the cost estimates of complying with air and water quality standards and other impacts of the environmental proposals.  The following cost estimates for periods following 2016 will change depending on the timing of implementation and whether the Federal EPA provides flexibility in the final rules.  These cost estimates will also change based on: (a) the states’ implementation of these regulatory programs, including the potential for state implementation plans (SIPs) or federal implementation plans (FIPs) that impose more stringent standards, (b) additional rulemaking activities in response to court decisions, (c) the actual performance of the pollution control technologies installed on the units, (d) changes in costs for new pollution controls, (e) new generating technology developments, (f) total MWs of capacity retired, replaced or sold, including the type and amount of such replacement capacity and (g) other factors.  The following cost estimates do not include any projected costs that might be triggered by compliance with the Clean Power Plan and are limited to only the costs of major projects to comply with existing air and water quality standards.  In addition, management is continuing to evaluate the economic feasibility of environmental investments on both regulated and nonregulated plants.

VERTICALLY INTEGRATED UTILITIES



GENERAL



AEP’s vertically integrated utility operations are engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo, PSO, SWEPCo and WPCo.  AEPSC, as agent for AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk management and trading activities on behalf of each of these subsidiaries.



ELECTRIC GENERATION



Facilities



As of December 31,2015, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries owned or leased approximately 23,600 MW of domestic generation.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the generation capacity of vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.



Fuel Supply



The 2013 results include fuel used and transported by OPCo, a utility subsidiary that is not part of the Vertically Integrated Utilities segment.  OPCo’s results appear here because it retained its generation until year-end 2013 at which point all of its generation was transferred to AGR which transferred portions to APCo and KPCo.



The table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:

201520142013Coal and Lignite70%72%75%Nuclear17%16%11%Natural Gas12%11%13%Hydroelectric and other1%1%<1%



A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.  AEP’s overall 2015 fossil fuel costs for the Vertically Integrated Utilities decreased approximately 12% on a dollar per MMBtu basis from 2014.  This was due to a significant decline in natural gas prices along with a marginal decrease in coal prices.



Coal and Lignite



AEP’s Vertically Integrated Utilities procure coal and lignite under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms.  Coal consumption in 2015 decreased from 2014 due to a decrease in power prices and corresponding decrease in demand for coal-fired generation.  As a result, coal inventories ended the year at above-target levels on a system basis.



Management believes that the Vertically Integrated Utilities will be able to secure and transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal and lignite-fired units.  Through subsidiaries, AEP owns, leases or controls more than 4,838 railcars, approximately 498 barges, 12 towboats, 8 harbor boats and a coal handling terminal with approximately 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store coal for use in AEP generating facilities.



Spot market prices for coal continued to decrease throughout 2015.  The decreased spot coal prices reflect the reduction in demand for coal-fired generation and the oversupply in the market.   As of December 31, 2015, slightly less than half of the coal purchased by AEP was procured through term contracts.  As those contracts expire, they are replaced












with contracts at current market prices.  The price impact of this process is reflected in subsequent periods.  The price paid for coal delivered in 2015 decreased from the prior year primarily due to a decrease in spot coal prices and heavier reliance on shorter term contracts.





The following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities:

201520142013Total coal delivered to the plants (millions of tons)37.341.051.1Average cost per ton of coal delivered$45.36$46.65$51.31



The coal supplies at  the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  As of December 31, 2015, the Vertically Integrated Utilities coal inventory was approximately 47 days of full load burn.  While inventory targets vary by plant and are changed as necessary, the current coal inventory target for the Vertically Integrated Utilities is approximately 30 days.



Natural Gas



The Vertically Integrated Utilities consumed over 89 billion cubic feet of natural gas during 2015 for generating power. This represents a decrease of 7% from 2014.  While AEP’s natural gas-fired generating capacity has increased over the past several years with the addition of the Stall and Dresden units, the implementation of the SPP Market and change in the dispatch of AEP’s natural gas fleet resulted in a decreased natural gas-fired generation.  Several of AEP’s natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines which allow greater access to competitive supplies and improve delivery reliability. A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal, and daily supply and transportation agreements provide natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate.  AEP’s natural gas supply agreements are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices.



The following table shows the amount of natural gas delivered to the Vertically Integrated Utilities plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of natural gas purchased by the Vertically Integrated Utilities.  Results for 2013 include natural gas delivered to OPCo, while results for 2015 and 2014 do not.

201520142013Total natural gas delivered to the plants (billion cubic feet)89.796.1158.3Average price per MMBtu of purchased natural gas$2.80$4.70$4.01



Nuclear



I&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of the Cook Plant.  I&M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various forms in the spot, short-term and mid-term markets.  I&M also continues to lease a portion of its nuclear fuel.



For purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of spent nuclear fuel, I&M completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage pool more than 10 years ago.  I&M entered into an agreement to provide for onsite dry cask storage of spent nuclear fuel to permit normal operations to continue.  I&M is scheduled to conduct further dry cask loading and storage projects on an ongoing periodic basis.  I&M completed its initial loading of spent nuclear fuel into the dry casks in 2012, which consisted of 12 casks (32 spent nuclear fuel assemblies contained within each).  The second loading of spent nuclear fuel into dry casks was completed in 2015, which consisted of 16 casks.  The third dry cask loading is expected to occur in 2018.














Nuclear Waste and Decommissioning



As the owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant safely.  The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program.  The most recent decommissioning cost study was completed in 2015.  The estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant was $1.6 billion in 2015 non-discounted dollars.  As of December 31,2015, the total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately $1.8 billion. The balance of funds available to eventually decommission Cook Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns.  The ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from estimates and funding targets as a result of the:



•Escalation of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation and the cost of energy).

•Further development of regulatory requirements governing decommissioning.

•Technology available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that assumed in studies.

•Availability of nuclear waste disposal facilities.

•Availability of a United States Department of Energy facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear fuel.



Accordingly, management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current projections.  AEP will seek recovery from customers through regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed projections.  See Note6to the financial statements, entitled Commitments, Guarantees and Contingencies under the heading Nuclear Contingencies, included in the2015Annual Reports, for information with respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning.



Low-Level Radioactive Waste



The Low-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980 mandates that the responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the individual states.  Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials.  Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available.  I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available. However the states of Utah and Texas have licensed low level radioactive waste disposal sites which currently accept low level radioactive waste from Michigan waste generators.  There is currently no set date limiting I&M’s access to either of these facilities.  The Cook Plant has a facility onsite designed specifically for the storage of low level radioactive waste.  In the event that low level radioactive waste disposal facility access becomes unavailable, then low level radioactive waste can be stored onsite at this facility.



Counterparty Risk Management



The Vertically Integrated Utilities segment also sells power and enters into related energy transactions with wholesale customers and other market participants.  As a result, counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31,2015, counterparties posted approximately $9 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEPSC for the benefit of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP’s public utility subsidiaries posted approximately$52 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the2015Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information.














Certain Power Agreements



I&M



The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I&M, dated March 31, 1982, provides for the sale by AEGCo to I&M of all the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant.  Whether or not power is available from AEGCo, I&M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power (and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by I&M).  The agreement will continue in effect until the last of the lease terms of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant have expired (currently December 2022) unless extended in specified circumstances.



Pursuant to an assignment between I&M and KPCo, and a unit power agreement between AEGCo and KPCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant.  KPCo has agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I&M would have paid AEGCo under the terms of the Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I&M for such entitlement.  The KPCo unit power agreement expires in December 2022.



OVEC



t.  OPCo has filed an application with the PUCO to approve a cost-based purchased power agreement (PPA) rider that would initially be based upon OPCo’s contractual entitlement under the Inter-Company Agreement which is approximately 20% of OVEC’s capacity

.



ELECTRIC DELIVERY



General



Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the state utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances, approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Regulation – Rates.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for both wholesale transmission transactions and wholesale generation contracts.  The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, principles, protocols and agreements in place with PJM, SPP and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.  See Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Regulation – FERC.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies.












Other than AEGCo, AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service within a specific territory.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.  For a discussion of competition in the sale of power, see Item 1. Business – Vertically Integrated Utilities – Competition.



Transmission Agreement



APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo own and operate transmission facilities that are used to provide transmission service under the PJM OATT and are parties to the TA.  OPCo, a subsidiary in AEP’s Transmission and Distribution Utilities segment, is also a party to the TA.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the revenues associated with their transmission facilities and the costs of transmission service provided by PJM.  The TA has been approved by the FERC.



TCA, OATT, and ERCOT Protocols



PSO, SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to the TCA.  Under the TCA, a coordinating committee is charged with the responsibility of (a) overseeing the coordinated planning of the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the performance of transmission planning studies, (b) the interaction of such subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies interested in transmission planning and (c) compliance with the terms of the OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such tariff.  Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring the reliability of their transmission systems and administering the OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement.  The TCA also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT.  These allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP.



Regional Transmission Organizations



AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM, and PSO and SWEPCo are members of the SPP (both FERC-approved RTOs).  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.



REGULATION



General



AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility commissions.  AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the FERC under the Federal Power Act with respect to wholesale power and transmission service transactions.  I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook Plant.  AEP and its vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are also subject to the regulatory provisions of EPACT, much of which is administered by the FERC.



Rates



Historically, state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  A utility’s cost of service generally reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  State utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility’s level of investment.  Absent a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or capping rates for a period












of time, a state utility commission can review and change rates on its own initiative.  Some states may initiate reviews at the request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group of customers.  Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.



Public utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset is placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate recovery.  Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of plant and equipment and volatile capital markets, management is actively pursuing strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash flow.  AEP representatives continue to engage state commissioners and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and enhance certainty in the process.  These options include pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections into rates.



The rates of AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e., generation, transmission and distribution service).  Historically, the state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries reflected specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs.  Fuel adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost changes.



The following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of certain major jurisdictions in which AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries operate.  Several public utility subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction.  See Note4to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the2015Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters.



Indiana



I&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of-service basis.  Indiana provides for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery mechanism.



Oklahoma



PSO provides retail electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the OCC.  PSO’s rates are set on a cost-of-service basis.  Fuel and purchased energy costs are recovered or refunded by applying fuel adjustment and other factors to retail kilowatt-hour sales.  The factors are generally adjusted annually and are based upon forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs.  Over or under collections of fuel and purchased energy costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the period following when new annual factors are established.



Virginia



APCo currently provides retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled rates approved by the Virginia SCC.  Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through a fuel adjustment clause.  Transmission services are provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.  In addition to base rates and fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate adjustment clauses.



West Virginia



APCo and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC, with rates set on a combined cost-of-service basis.  West Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy cost which trues-up to actual expenses.














FERC





The FERC oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility transmission assets.  Order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and functions of acceptable RTO proposals.  AEGCo, APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo are members of PJM.  PSO and SWEPCo are members of SPP.



The FERC has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of most of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or sale of certain utility assets and mergers with another electric utility or holding company.  In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.  EPACT gives the FERC increased utility merger oversight.



COMPETITION



The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP, like the electric industry generally, face competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis, primarily to other public utilities and power marketers.  Federal policy generally fosters competition in the wholesale market by creating a generation market and mandates that all generators have equal access to transmission services.  As a result, there are more generators able to participate in this market.  The principal factors in competing for wholesale sales are price (including fuel costs), reliability of service, and availability of capacity and power.



Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries.  AEP’s vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries also compete with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.  With respect to competing generators and self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they currently maintain a competitive position.



Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AEP’s competitiveness.














While the adoption rate of distributed generation in AEP’s service areas has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country, AEP’s vertically integrated utility companies are focused on providing customers with more choices by working with regulators and policymakers to expand, and potentially accelerate, renewable energy offerings.  Such additional customer choices consider not only long-term cost, but are also focused on expanding resource diversity.  This includes proposed new revenue structures that enable deployment of advanced technologies and resources. In 2015, AEP formed an Enterprise Technology Council to develop and deploy new programs and services designed to receive regulatory support.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that the reliability of their service, the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and their ability to cost-effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as solar, on a large scale place them in a favorable competitive position.



In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated,subsidized or encouraged through legislation or regulationor otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity.  This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could cause AEP to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.  If AEP retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AEP will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants.  AEP typically recovers undepreciated plant balances and associated operating costs from customers through regulated rates in regulated jurisdictions.  Failure to recover these costs could reduce future net income and cash flows and possibly harm financial condition.



Recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the AEP System.  Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP work with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options pursuant to tariffs filed with, and approved by, the various state commissions.  The vertically integrated public utility subsidiaries of AEP also work with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources.  Depending on the jurisdiction, customers may have access to green power tariffs.  In other instances, AEP purchases renewable power that is available to all customers in a specific jurisdiction.



SEASONALITY



The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters.  In addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP’s results of operations.














TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION UTILITIES



GENERAL



This segment consists of the transmission and distribution of electricity for sale to retail and wholesale customers through assets owned and operated by OPCo, TCC and TNC. OPCo is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately1,468,000retail customers in Ohio.  TCC is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately826,000retail customers through REPs in southern Texas. TNC is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electric power to approximately189,000retail customers through REPs in west and central Texas.



AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries own and operate transmission and distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the transmission and distribution lines.  Most of the transmission and distribution services are sold to retail customers of AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries in their service territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the PUCT for TCC and TNC and by the PUCO and the FERC for OPCo.  The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale transmission transactions.  As discussed below, some transmission services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies.



AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries hold franchises or other rights to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility with the exclusive right to provide electric service.  These franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general, the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct of their business.



The use and the recovery of costs associated with the transmission assets of the AEP transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries are subject to the rules, protocols and agreements in place with PJM and ERCOT, and as approved by the FERC.  In addition to providing transmission services in connection with power sales in their service areas, AEP’s transmission and distribution utility subsidiaries through RTOs also provide transmission services for non-affiliated companies.



Transmission Agreement



OPCo, together with APCo, I&M, KGPCo, KPCo and WPCo, is a party to the TA.  The TA defines how the parties to the agreement share the cost of their transmission facilities.  The TA has been approved by the FERC.



Regional Transmission Organizations



OPCo is a member of PJM, a FERC-approved RTO.  RTOs operate, plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between participants owning transmission assets and those that do not.  TCC and TNC are members of ERCOT.



REGULATION



OPCo provides distribution and transmission services to retail customers within its service territory at cost-based rates approved by the PUCO or by the FERC.  TCC and TNC provide transmission and distribution service on a cost-of-service basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT rules.  Transmission and distribution rates are established on a cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its investment used in providing that service.  The cost of service generally reflects operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense, depreciation expense and taxes.  Utility commissions periodically adjust rates pursuant to a review of (a) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses during a defined test period and (b) such utility’s level of investment.














FERC



Under the Federal Power Act, the FERC regulates rates for transmission of electric power, accounting and other matters.  The FERC regulations require AEP to provide open access transmission service at FERC-approved rates.  The FERC also regulates unbundled transmission service to retail customers.  The FERC requires each public utility that owns or controls interstate transmission facilities to, directly or through an RTO, file an open access network and point-to-point transmission tariff that offers services comparable to the utility’s own uses of its transmission system.  The FERC also requires all transmitting utilities, directly or through an RTO, to establish an Open Access Same-time Information System, which electronically posts transmission information such as available capacity and prices, and requires utilities to comply with Standards of Conduct that prohibit utilities’ transmission employees from providing non-public transmission information to the utility’s marketing employees. In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding company system.  EPACT gives the FERC increased utility merger oversight.



SEASONALITY



The delivery of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of AEP’s transmission and distribution facilities.  In addition, AEP transmission and distribution has historically delivered less power, and consequently earned less income, when weather conditions are milder.  Unusually mild weather in the future could diminish AEP transmission and distribution’s results of operations and may impact its financial condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could increase AEP transmission and distribution’s results of operations.





AEP TRANSMISSION HOLDCO (AEPTHCO)



GENERAL



AEPTHCo is a holding company for (a) AEPTCo, which is the direct holding company for the seven wholly-owned FERC-regulated transmission-only electric utilities (Transcos) listed below, each of which is geographically aligned with AEP’s existing utility operating companies and (b) AEP’s transmission joint ventures.



AEPTCo TRANSCOS



AEP East Transmission Companies(the “AEP East Transmission Companies”, all located within PJM)



•AEP Appalachian Transmission Company, Inc. (APTCo)

•AEP Indiana Michigan Transmission Company, Inc. (IMTCo)

•AEP Kentucky Transmission Company, Inc. (KTCo)

•AEP Ohio Transmission Company, Inc. (OHTCo)

•AEP West Virginia Transmission Company, Inc. (WVTCo)



AEP West Transmission Companies(the “AEP West Transmission Companies”, all located within SPP)



•AEP Oklahoma Transmission Company, Inc. (OKTCo)

•AEP Southwestern Transmission Company, Inc. (SWTCo) (covering Louisiana)



Transmission development through the Transcos is primarily driven by:



•Improvements to local area reliability by upgrading, rebuilding or replacing existing, aging infrastructure.

•Construction of new facilities to support customer points of delivery, generation interconnections, new facilities to provide transmission service directed by the RTOs, and new facilities required to maintain grid reliability.










•Projects assigned as a result of the regional planning initiatives conducted by PJM and SPP.  PJM and SPP identify the need for transmission in support of regional reliability, congestion reduction and the integration of and retirement of generation facilities.



The Transcos develop, own and operate transmission assets that are physically connected to AEP’s existing system.  They are regulated for rate-making purposes exclusively by the FERC and employ a forward-looking formula rate tariff design.  The Transcos are independent of, but overlay AEP’s existing vertically integrated utility operating companies and the transmission operations of OPCo.  IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo and WVTCo have received approvals for formation or did not require state commission approval to operate.  IMTCo, KTCo, OHTCo, OKTCo and WVTCo currently own and operate transmission assets.  An application for regulatory approval for SWTCo is under consideration in Louisiana.  As of December 31, 2015, AEPTCo’s subsidiaries had $2.8 billion of transmission assets in-service with plans to construct approximately $3.5 billion of additional transmission assets through 2018.












AEPTHCo JOINT VENTURE INITIATIVES



AEP has established joint ventures with other electric utility companies for the purpose of developing, building, and owning transmission assets that seek to improve reliability and market efficiency and provide transmission access to remote generation sources in North America.



AEP is currently participating in the following joint venture initiatives:

(a)ETT is undertaking multiple projects and the completion dates will vary for those projects.  ETT’s investment in completed, current and future projects in ERCOT over the next ten years is expected to be $3.5 billion.  Future projects will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

(b)AEP owns 25% of Prairie Wind Transmission, LLC (Prairie Wind) through its ownership interest in ETA.  ETA is a 50/50 joint venture with Berkshire Hathaway Energy (formerly known as MidAmerican Energy) and AEP.

(c)The Pioneer project consists of approximately 286 miles of new 765 kV transmission lines, which is estimated to cost $1.1 billion at completion.  Pioneer is developing the first 66-mile segment jointly with Northern Indiana Public Service Company at a total estimated cost of $386 million.  The projected completion date for the first 66-mile segment is 2018.  The projected completion dates for the remaining segments have not been determined.

(d)AEP owns 87.5% of RITELine Indiana, LLC (RITELine IN) through its ownership interest in RITELine Transmission Development, LLC (RTD) and AEP Transmission Holding Company, LLC (AEPTHCo).  AEP owns 12.5% of RITELine Illinois, LLC (RITELine IL) through its ownership interest in RTD.  RTD is a 50/50 joint venture with Exelon Transmission Company, LLC and AEPTHCo.

(e)RITELine IN is a consolidated variable interest entity.  RTD received an order from the FERC in October 2011 granting incentives for the RITELine IN and RITELine IL projects.  The projects and other segments that are electrically equivalent in nature will continue to be submitted for consideration in the interregional planning process between PJM and MISO as dictated by emerging system needs.

(f)AEP owns 86.5% of Transource Missouri and Transource West Virginia through its ownership interest in Transource Energy, LLC (Transource).  Transource is a joint venture with AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy formed to pursue competitive transmission projects.  AEPTHCo and Great Plains Energy own 86.5% and 13.5% of Transource, respectively.

(g)The ROE represents the weighted average approved return on equity based on the projected costs of two projects currently under development by Transource Missouri:  the $65 million Iatan-Nashua project (10.3%) and the $266 million Sibley-Nebraska City project (11.3%).

(h)An application for recovery has been filed and a settlement is pending which calls for 10% Base ROE, together with a 0.50% rider, for Transource West Virginia’s 15 mile 138kV line Thorofare project.

(i)RITELine IN, Transource Missouri and Transource West Virginia are consolidated joint ventures by AEP.  Therefore, the investment value listed reflects applicable income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP.  All other investments in this schedule are joint ventures that are not consolidated by AEP.  Therefore, these investment values listed do not reflect income taxes that are the responsibility of AEP.



AEP’s joint ventures do not have employees.  Business services for the joint ventures are provided by AEPSC and other AEP subsidiaries and the joint venture partners.  During 2015 approximately 521 AEPSC employees and 253 operating company employees provided service to one or more joint ventures.










REGULATION



The Transcos and joint ventures located outside of ERCOT establish transmission rates annually through forward looking formula rate filings with the FERC pursuant to FERC-approved implementation protocols.  The protocols include a transparent, formal review process to ensure the updated transmission rates are prudently incurred and reasonably calculated.



The Transcos’ and joint ventures’ (where applicable) rates are included in the respective OATT for PJM and SPP.  An OATT is the FERC rate schedule that provides the terms and conditions for transmission and related services on a transmission provider’s transmission system.  The FERC requires transmission providers such as PJM and SPP to offer transmission service to all eligible customers (for example, load-serving entities, power marketers, generators and customers) on a non-discriminatory basis.



The FERC-approved formula rates establish the annual transmission revenue requirement (ATRR) and transmission service rates for transmission owners in annual rate base filings with FERC.  The formula rates establish rates for a one-year period based on the current projects in-service and proposed projects for a defined timeframe.  The formula rates also include a true-up calculation for the previous year’s billings, allowing for over/under-recovery of the transmission owner’s ATRR.  PJM and SPP pay the transmission owners their ATRR for use of their facilities and bill transmission customers taking service under the PJM and SPP OATTs, based on the terms and conditions in the respective OATT for the service taken.



The formula rate mechanism allows for a return on equity of 11.49% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity for the AEP East Transmission Companies.  The AEP West Transmission Companies are allowed a return on equity of 11.2% based on a capital structure of up to 50% equity. The authorized returns on equity for the Transcos are commensurate with the FERC-authorized returns on equity in the PJM and SPP OATTs, respectively, for AEP’s utility subsidiaries.



In the annual rate base filings described above, the Transcos in aggregate filed rate base totals of $2.3 billion in 2015, $1.4 billion for 2014 and $776 million for 2013.  The total transmission revenue requirement filed in the ATRR, including prior year over/under-recovery of revenue and associated carrying charges, for 2015, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $363 million, $231 million, $107 million and $34 million, respectively.



The rates of ETT, which is located in ERCOT, are determined by the PUCT.  ETT sets its rates through a combination of base rate cases and interim Transmission Costs of Services (TCOS) filings.  ETT may file interim TCOS filings semi-annually to update its rates to reflect changes in its net invested capital.In November 2015, the PUCT ordered ETT to file a base rate case by February 2017.  A base rate review could produce a refund if ETT incurs a disallowance of the transmission investment on which an interim TCOS increase was based.  A refund of interim transmission rates would reduce future net income and cash flows.  Management is unable to determine a range of potential losses that are reasonably possible of occurring.See Note4to the financial statements, entitled Rate Matters, included in the 2015 Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate matters.



AEP’s joint ventures have approved returns on equity ranging from 9.96% to 12.8% based on equity capital structures ranging from 40% to 60%.



COMPETITION



One of the most significant provisions of FERC Order No. 1000 is the removal of the federal right of first refusal for incumbent utilities within tariffs and agreements for certain regional transmission projects. Historically, vertically integrated public utilities had the right to build and own transmission lines proposed by the region’s planning processes when those lines connected to facilities within their respective retail service territories.  FERC Order No. 1000 eliminates the federal right of first refusal in RTO tariffs for incumbent utilities to construct certain regional transmission projects within their own service territories, thereby creating the opportunity for any qualified entity to build and own regional transmission facilities in any service territory.  Transource was created to respond to FERC Order No. 1000 competitive processes at the RTO level.














GENERATION & MARKETING



GENERAL



The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries consist of competitive nonutility generating assets, a wholesale energy trading and marketing business and a retail supply and energy management business.  The largest subsidiary in the Generation & Marketing segment is AGR.  AGR owns 6,752 MW of generating capacity, with rights to an additional 1,186 MW pursuant to a unit power agreement (see below).  Other subsidiaries in this segment own or have the right to receive power from additional generation assets.  See Item 2 – Properties for more information regarding the generation assets of the Generation & Marketing segment. AGR is a competitive generation subsidiary.



With respect to wholesale energy trading and marketing business, AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries enter into short and long-term transactions to buy or sell capacity, energy and ancillary services in ERCOT, SPP, MISO and PJM.  These subsidiaries sell power into the market and engage in power, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances risk management and trading activities.



These activities primarily involve the purchase and sale of electricity (and to a lesser extent, natural gas, coal and emissions allowances) under forward contracts at fixed and variable prices.  These contracts include physical transactions, exchange-traded futures, and to a lesser extent, over-the-counter swaps and options.  The majority of forward contracts are typically settled by entering into offsetting contracts.  These transactions are executed with numerous counterparties or on exchanges.



With respect to the retail supply and energy management business, AEP’s subsidiary AEP Energy is a retail energy supplier that supplies electricity to residential, commercial, and industrial customers.  AEP Energy provides an array of energy solutions and is operating in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio and Washington, D.C.  AEP Energy also provides demand-side management solutions nationwide.  AEP Energy had approximately 375,000 customer accounts as of December 31,2015.



REGULATION



AGR is a public utility under the Federal Power Act, and is subject to FERC’s exclusive ratemaking jurisdiction over wholesale sales of electricity and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the Federal Power Act, FERC has the authority to grant or deny market-based rates for sales of energy, capacity and ancillary services to ensure that such sales are just and reasonable.  FERC granted AGR market-based rate authority in December 2013.  FERC’s jurisdiction over ratemaking also includes the authority to suspend the market-based rates of utilities (including AGR, which is a public utility as defined by the FERC) and set cost-based rates if FERC subsequently determines that such utility can exercise market power, create barriers to entry or engage in abusive affiliate transactions.  As a condition to the order granting AGR market-based rate authority, every three years AGR is required to file a market power update to show that it continues to meet FERC’s standards with respect to generation market power and other criteria used to evaluate whether it continues to qualify for market-based rates.  Other matters subject to FERC jurisdiction include, but are not limited to, review of mergers, and dispositions of jurisdictional facilities and acquisitions of securities of another public utility or an existing operational generating facility.



Specific operations of AGR are also subject to the jurisdiction of various other Federal, state, regional and local agencies, including Federal and state environmental protection agencies.  AGR is also regulated by the PUCT for transactions inside ERCOT.  Additionally, AGR is subject to mandatory reliability standards promulgated by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, with the approval of FERC.



COMPETITION



The AEP Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries face competition for the sale of available power, capacity and ancillary services.  The principal factors of impact are electricity and fuel prices, new market entrants, construction or retirement of generating assets by others and technological advances in power generation. Because much of AGR’s












generation is coal-fired, lower relative natural gas prices will favor competitors that have a higher concentration of natural gas fueled generation.  Other factors impacting competitiveness include environmental regulation, transmission congestion or transportation constraints at or near generation facilities, inoperability or inefficiencies, outages and deactivations and retirements at generation facilities.



Technology advancements, increased demand for clean energy, changing consumer behaviors, low-priced and abundant natural gas, and regulatory and public policy reforms are among the catalysts for transformation within the industry that impact competition for AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment.  AGR also competes with self-generation and with distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil, renewables and coal, within their service areas.  The primary factors in such competition are price, unit availability and the capability of customers to utilize sources of energy other than electric power.



Changes in regulatory policies and advances in newer technologies for batteries or energy storage, fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and photovoltaic solar cells are reducing costs of new technology to levels that are making them competitive with some central station electricity production.  The ability to maintain relatively low cost, efficient and reliable operations and to provide cost-effective programs and services to customers are significant determinants of AGR’s competitiveness.  The costs of photovoltaic solar cells in particular have continued to become increasingly competitive.



While the adoption rate of distributed generation in areas that AGR sells power has not reached the levels seen in other parts of the country, AEP expects these trends to continue.  AGR believes that the unit availability, the limited ability of customers to substitute other economical sources for electric power and its ability to cost-effectively deploy advanced technologies, such as solar, on a large scale place it in a favorable competitive position.



In the event that alternative generation resources are mandated, subsidized or encouraged through climate legislation or regulation or otherwise are economically competitive and added to the available generation supply, such resources could displace a higher marginal cost fossil plant, which could reduce the price at which market participants sell their electricity. This occurrence could then reduce the market price at which all generators in that region would be able to sell their output. These events could cause AGR to retire generating capacity prior to the end of its estimated useful life.   If AGR retires generation plants prior to the end of their estimated useful life, there can be no assurance that AGR will recover the remaining costs associated with such plants and may be forced to shut down competitive units.



Recent changes in the global economy have led to increased competition for many industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the Generation & Marketing segment.  Industrial customers that are downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which may include, among other things, the cost of electric power.  The Generation & Marketing segment works with such customers to meet their business needs through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options.  The Generation & Marketing segment also works with customers that seek to source more of their electric power from renewable resources.



SEASONALITY



The sale of electric power is generally a seasonal business.  In many parts of the country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices also peaking at that time.  In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter months.  The pattern of this fluctuation may change.



Fuel Supply



The table shows the generation sources by type, on an actual net generation (MWhs) basis, used by the Generation and Marketing segment, not including the Oklaunion generating unit:

20152014Coal75%88%Natural Gas25%12%Fuel Oil and other<   1%<   1%












A price increase/decrease in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in the decreased/increased use of other fuels.



Coal and Consumables

AGR procures coal and consumables needed to burn the coal under a combination of purchasing arrangements including long-term and spot contracts with various producers and coal trading firms.  As contracts expire, they are replaced, as needed, with contracts at market prices. Coal and consumable inventories remain adequate to meet generation requirements.

Management believes that AGR will be able to secure and transport coal and consumables of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to operate their coal fired units.  AGR, through its contracts with third party transporters, has the ability to adequately move and store coal and consumables for use in its generating facilities.  AGR plants consumed 11.2 million tons of coal in 2015.



The coal supplies at AGR plants vary from time to time depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages, transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal consumption rates, coal quality, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather conditions, which may interrupt production or deliveries.  AGR likes to maintain the coal inventory of its managed plants in the range of 15 to 40 days of full load burn.  As of December 31, 2015, the coal inventory of AGR was approximately 57 days of full load burn.



Natural Gas



Despite the availability of natural gas due to the increased shale supply, the U.S. pipeline infrastructure remains a limiting factor in the expansion of natural gas-fired generation.  A portfolio of term, monthly, seasonal firm and daily peaking purchase and transportation agreements (that are entered into on a competitive basis and based on market prices) supplies natural gas requirements for each plant, as appropriate.  AGR plants consumed 86 billion cubic feet of natural gas in 2015, an increase of approximately 73% from 2014.



Counterparty Risk Management



Counterparties and exchanges may require cash or cash related instruments to be deposited on these transactions as margin against open positions.  As of December 31,2015, counterparties posted approximately $26 million in cash, cash equivalents or letters of credit with AEP for the benefit of AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries (while, as of that date, AEP’s Generation & Marketing segment subsidiaries posted approximately$225 million with counterparties and exchanges).  Since open trading contracts are valued based on market prices of various commodities, exposures change daily.  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the2015Annual Reports, under the heading entitled Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information.



Certain Power Agreements



AEGCo



The Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and AGR (assigned from OPCo) dated March 15, 2007, provides for the sale by AEGCo to AGR of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary services available to AGR from the Lawrenceburg Plant, a 1,186 MW natural gas-fired unit owned by AEGCo.  AGR is obligated to pay a capacity charge (whether or not power is available from the Lawrenceburg Plant), and the fuel, operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by AGR, and to reimburse AEGCo for other costs associated with the operation and ownership of the Lawrenceburg Plant.  The agreement will continue in effect until December 31, 2017 unless extended.














OPCo



Pursuant to a Power Supply Agreement (PSA) between AGR and OPCo, AGR supplied capacity for OPCo’s switched and non-switched retail load for the period January 1, 2014 through May 31, 2015.



Other



As of December 31,2015, the assets utilized in this segment included approximately 310 MW of company-owned domestic wind power facilities, 177 MW of domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements and 355 MW of coal-fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through 2027 that transfers TNC’s interest in the Oklaunion power station to AEP Energy Partners, Inc.  The power obtained from the Oklaunion power station is marketed and sold in ERCOT.





AEP RIVER OPERATIONS



Prior to its sale in November 2015, AEP River Operations segment transported liquid, coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on the Ohio, Illinois and lower Mississippi rivers.  As a result of the sale, AEP River Operations is no longer a business segment.
