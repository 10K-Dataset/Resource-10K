ITEM 1.     BUSINESS



GENERAL



OVERVIEW
AND DESCRIPTION OF SUBSIDIARIES



AEP was
incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1906 and reorganized in
1925. It is a public utility holding company that owns, directly or indirectly,
all of the outstanding common stock of its public utility subsidiaries and
varying percentages of other subsidiaries.



The
service areas of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries cover portions of the states
of Arkansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee,
Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. The generating and transmission facilities of
AEP’s public utility subsidiaries are interconnected and their operations are
coordinated. Transmission networks are interconnected with extensive
distribution facilities in the territories served. The public utility
subsidiaries of AEP have traditionally provided electric service, consisting of
generation, transmission and distribution, on an integrated basis to their
retail customers. Restructuring legislation in Michigan, Ohio, and the ERCOT
area of Texas has caused AEP public utility subsidiaries in those states to
unbundle previously integrated regulated rates for their retail
customers.



The AEP
System is an integrated electric utility system. As a result, the member
companies of the AEP System have contractual, financial and other business
relationships with the other member companies, such as participation in the AEP
System savings and retirement plans and tax returns, sales of electricity and
transportation and handling of fuel. The companies of the AEP System also obtain
certain accounting, administrative, information systems, engineering, financial,
legal, maintenance and other services at cost from a common provider,
AEPSC.



At
December 31, 2009, the subsidiaries of AEP had a total of 21,673 employees.
Because it is a holding company rather than an operating company, AEP has no
employees. The public utility subsidiaries of AEP are:

FINANCING



General



Companies
within the AEP System generally use short-term debt to finance working capital
needs.  Short-term debt is also used to finance acquisitions,
construction and redemption or repurchase of outstanding securities until such
needs can be financed with long-term debt. In recent history, short-term funding
needs have been provided for by cash on hand, borrowing under AEP's revolving
credit agreements and AEP’s commercial paper program.  Funds are
made available to subsidiaries under the AEP corporate borrowing program.
Certain public utility subsidiaries of AEP also sell accounts receivable to
provide liquidity. SeeManagement’s Financial Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations, included in the 2009 Annual
Reports, under the heading entitledFinancial Conditionfor
additional information concerning short-term funding and our access to bank
lines of credit, commercial paper and capital markets.



AEP’s
revolving credit agreements (which backstop the commercial paper program)
include covenants and events of default typical for this type of facility,
including a maximum debt/capital test and a $50 million cross-acceleration
provision. At December 31, 2009, AEP was in compliance with its debt covenants.
With the exception of a voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency, any event of default
has either or both a cure period or notice requirement before termination of the
agreements. A voluntary bankruptcy or insolvency of AEP would be considered an
immediate termination event.  SeeManagement’s Financial Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations, included in the 2009 Annual
Reports, under the heading entitledFinancial Conditionfor
additional information with respect to AEP’s credit agreements.



AEP’s
subsidiaries have also utilized, and expect to continue to utilize, additional
financing arrangements, such as leasing arrangements, including the leasing of
coal transportation equipment and facilities.



Credit
Ratings



The
credit ratings of AEP and its registrant subsidiaries as of February 23, 2010
are set forth below.  In 2009, Moody’s Investors Service placed the
credit ratings of AEP (the parent) on negative outlook.  In 2009,
Fitch Ratings placed the credit ratings of TCC and SWEPCO on negative
outlook.  SeeManagement’s Financial Discussion
and Analysis of Results of Operations, included in the 2009 Annual
Reports, under the heading entitledFinancial Conditionfor

ENVIRONMENTAL
AND OTHER MATTERS



General



AEP’s
subsidiaries are currently subject to regulation by federal, state and local
authorities with regard to air and water-quality control and other environmental
matters, and are subject to zoning and other regulation by local authorities.
The environmental issues that we believe are potentially material to the AEP
system are outlined below.



Clean
Air Act Requirements



The CAA
establishes a comprehensive program to protect and improve the nation’s air
quality and control mobile and stationary sources of air
emissions.  The major CAA programs affecting our power plants are
described below.  The states implement and administer many of these
programs and could impose additional or more stringent
requirements.



National Ambient Air Quality
Standards:The CAA requires the Federal EPA to review
periodically the available scientific data for six criteria pollutants and
establish a concentration level in the ambient air for those substances that is
adequate to protect the public health and welfare with an extra safety
margin.  These concentration levels are known as national ambient air
quality standards (NAAQS).



Each
state identifies the areas within its boundaries that meet the NAAQS (attainment
areas) and those that do not (nonattainment areas).  Each state must
develop a state implementation plan (SIP) to bring nonattainment areas into
compliance with the NAAQS and maintain good air quality in attainment
areas.   All SIPs are submitted to the Federal EPA for
approval.  If a state fails to develop adequate plans, the Federal EPA
develops and implements a plan.  As the Federal EPA reviews the NAAQS,
the attainment status of areas can change and states may be required to develop
new SIPs.  In 2008, the Federal EPA issued revised NAAQS for both
ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The PM2.5standard was remanded by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, but a new standard
has not yet been proposed.  In 2009 the Obama Administration
reconsidered the ozone standard and proposed a more stringent
standard.  Federal EPA has also proposed a new short-term standard for
SO2and a new, lower standard for NO2.  The
Federal EPA also established a lower standard for lead.  These new
standards could result in additional emission reductions being required from our
facilities.



In 2005,
the Federal EPA issued the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR).  It
requires specific reductions in SO2and
NOxemissions from power plants and assists states developing new SIPs to meet the
NAAQS.  CAIR reduces regional emissions of SO2and
NOx(which can be transformed into PM and ozone) from power plants in the Eastern
U.S. (28 states and the District of Columbia).  CAIR requires power
plants within these states to reduce emissions of SO2by 45% by
2010, and by 57% by 2015 from 2003 levels.  NOxemissions
were subject to additional limits beginning in 2009, and would be reduced by a
total of 61% by 2015 from 2003 levels.  Reduction of both SO2and
NOxemissions under CAIR is to be achieved through a cap-and-trade
program.  In July 2008, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals remanded
CAIR to the Federal EPA.  CAIR remains in effect while Federal EPA
conducts further rulemaking, and we are complying with our obligations under
CAIR.   We are unable to predict how the Federal EPA will respond
to the remand, but we expect a proposal from Federal EPA in the spring of
2010.  A SIP that complied with CAIR also established compliance with
other CAA requirements, including certain visibility goals.  It is
uncertain how Federal EPA will deal with these requirements on
remand.  The Federal EPA or states may elect to seek further
reductions of SO2and
NOxin
response to more stringent PM and ozone NAAQS or restrict or eliminate the
trading programs in the replacement developed for CAIR.



Hazardous Air
Pollutants:As a result of the 1990 Amendments to the CAA, the
Federal EPA investigated hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from the
electric utility sector and submitted a report to Congress, identifying mercury
emissions from coal-fired power plants as warranting further
study.  In 2005, the Federal EPA issued a Clean Air Mercury Rule
(CAMR) setting New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for mercury emissions
from new and modified coal-fired power plants and requiring all states to issue
new SIPs including mercury requirements for existing coal-fired power
plants.  The Federal EPA issued a model federal rule based on a
cap-and-trade program for mercury emissions from existing coal-fired power
plants that would reduce mercury emissions to 38 tons per year from all existing
plants in 2010, and to 15 tons per year in 2018.



In 2008,
the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated and remanded CAMR to the Federal
EPA.  The Federal EPA has issued an information collection request to
coal-fired power plants for emission information on mercury and several
additional HAPs, and has announced its intention to issue a proposed rule in
2011.  We are unable to predict at this time how the Federal EPA
response to the remand will affect our facilities or their costs of operation,
but it could be material.



x




The Acid Rain
Program:The 1990 Amendments to the CAA include a
cap-and-trade emission reduction program for SO2emissions
from power plants.  By 2000, the program established a nationwide cap
on power plant SO2emissions
of 8.9 million tons per year.  The 1990 Amendments also contain
requirements for power plants to reduce NOxemissions
through the use of available combustion controls.



The
success of the SO2cap-and-trade program encouraged the Federal EPA and the states to use it as a
model for other emission reduction programs, including CAIR and
CAMR.  We continue to meet our obligations under the Acid Rain Program
through the installation of controls, use of alternate fuels and participation
in the emissions allowance markets.  CAIR currently uses the SO2allowances
originally allocated through the Acid Rain Program as the basis for its SO2cap-and-trade system.  We are unable to predict if or how any
replacement for CAIR will utilize the SO2allowances
from the Acid Rain Program.



Regional
Haze:  The CAA establishes visibility goals for certain
federally designated areas, including national parks, and requires states to
submit SIPs that will demonstrate reasonable progress toward preventing
impairment of visibility in these areas (Regional Haze program).  In
2005, the Federal EPA issued its Clean Air Visibility Rule (CAVR), detailing how
the CAA’s best available retrofit technology (BART) requirements will be applied
to facilities built between 1962 and 1977 that emit more than 250 tons per year
of certain pollutants in specific industrial categories, including power
plants.  The final rule contains a demonstration that CAIR will result
in more visibility improvements than BART for power plants subject to
it.  Thus, states are allowed to substitute CAIR requirements in their
Regional Haze program SIPs for controls that would otherwise be required by
BART.  For BART-eligible facilities located in states not subject to
CAIR requirements for SO2and
NOx(Oklahoma, Texas and Arkansas of the AEP System), some additional
controls will be required.  The courts upheld the final
rule.



In
January 2009, the Federal EPA issued a determination that 37 states (including
Indiana, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas and Virginia) failed to submit SIPs fulfilling
the Regional Haze program requirements by the deadline, and commencing a 2-year
period for the development of a Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) in these
states.  We are unable to predict if or how the remand of CAIR or the
development of a FIP to satisfy CAVR in certain states may affect our compliance
obligations for the Regional Haze programs.



Clean
      Water Act Requirements



Our
operations are also subject to the Federal Clean Water Act, which prohibits the
discharge of pollutants into waters of the United States except pursuant to
appropriate permits, and regulates systems that withdraw surface water for
use in our power plants.  In 2004, the Federal EPA issued a final rule
requiring all large existing power plants with once-through cooling water
systems to meet certain standards to reduce mortality of aquatic organisms
pinned against the plant’s cooling water intake screen or entrained in the
cooling water.  The standards vary based on the water bodies from
which the plants draw their cooling water.  We expected additional
capital and operating expenses, which the Federal EPA estimated could be $193
million for our plants.  We undertook site-specific studies and have
been evaluating site-specific compliance or mitigation measures that could
significantly change these cost estimates.



In July
2007, the Federal EPA suspended the 2004 rule, except for the requirement that
permitting agencies develop best professional judgment (BPJ) controls for
existing facility cooling water intake structures that reflect the best
technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.  The
result is that the BPJ control standard for cooling water intake structures in
effect prior to the 2004 rule is used as the applicable standard by permitting
agencies pending finalization of revised rules by the Federal EPA.



In April
2009, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that allows the Federal EPA the
discretion to rely on cost-benefit analysis in setting national performance
standards and in providing for cost-benefit variances from those standards as
part of the regulations.  We cannot predict if or how the Federal EPA
will apply this decision to any revision of the regulations or what effect it
may have on similar requirements adopted by the states.  We expect
Federal EPA to issue revised rules in 2010.



Federal
EPA is also engaged in rulemaking to update the technology-based standards that
govern discharges from new and existing power plants under the Clean Water Act’s
NPDES program.  These standards were last updated over 20 years ago,
and EPA has issued two rounds of information collection requests to inform its
rulemaking.  In October 2009, Federal EPA issued a final report for
the power plant sector and determined that revisions to its existing standards
are necessary, but EPA has not yet proposed any specific
requirements.  Until new standards are proposed, we cannot predict the
outcome or impact of these rules on our operations.

      Ash Regulation







Global
      Warming



Position and
strategy:  The topics of whether the earth is warming, how much
and how fast, what role human activity plays, and what to do about it are very
controversial and actively debated.  The public policy makers and
influencers in Washington and in the 11 states we serve have conflicting views.
We are focused on taking, in the short term, actions that we see as prudent,
such as improving energy efficiency, investing in developing cost-effective and
less carbon-intensive technologies, and evaluating our assets across a range of
plausible scenarios and outcomes.  We are also active participants in
a variety of public policy discussions at state and federal levels, to assure
that proposed new requirements are feasible and the economies of the states we
serve are not placed at a competitive disadvantage.



We
support a reasonable approach to reduce emissions of CO2and other
greenhouse gases (generally referred to throughout as CO2) that
recognizes that a reliable and affordable electric supply is vital to economic
stability.  We have taken measurable, voluntary actions to reduce and
offset our own CO2emissions.  We participate in a number of voluntary programs to
monitor, mitigate, and reduce CO2emissions,
including the Federal EPA’s Climate Leaders program, the DOE’s CO2reporting
program, and the Chicago Climate Exchange.  We are considering several
options that protect the reliability of the electric system while reducing our
carbon emissions. Our strategy is to pursue multiple options including renewable
energy, energy efficiency, new technologies, offsets and nuclear generation. At
the same time we will continue to improve the efficiency of our plants, retire
or mothball some older, inefficient coal units when factors warrant, and
complete our environmental retrofit program. For additional information on
legislative and regulatory responses to global warming, including limitations on
CO2emissions, seeManagement’s
Financial Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operationsunder the
headings entitledEnvironmental Matters – Global
Warming.Specific steps taken to reduce CO2emissions
include the following:



Carbon Capture and Storage



We
successfully captured, transported and stored  CO2emissions
from a coal-fired power plant in deep geologic formations for the first time in
October 2009, for 20 MW of our 1,300 MW Mountaineer Plant in West
Virginia.  The next phase of this project – to install the nation’s
first commercial-scale coal-derived CO2capture
and storage system at the Mountaineer Plant—will be partially funded through the
U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Clean Coal Power Initiative. AEP has been
awarded federal grant funding of $334 million, which represents approximately
half the cost of this phase of the project, exclusive of asset retirement
obligations. The commercial-scale phase of AEP’s CO2program
will capture approximately 90% of the CO2from 235
MW of the plant’s 1,300 MW of capacity.



Renewable
Sources of Energy



Some of
our states have passed legislation establishing renewable energy, alternative
energy, and/or energy efficiency requirements or goals (including Ohio, Texas,
Michigan, Virginia and West Virginia) and we are taking steps to comply with
these requirements in a timely fashion. In order to meet these requirements and
as a key part of its corporate sustainability effort, AEP pledged to increase
its renewable power by an additional 2000 MW from its 2007 levels by 2011,
subject to regulatory approval.  By the end of 2009, AEP has already
secured, through power purchase agreements, an additional 1,013.5 MW of
renewable power.  AEP’s integrated resource plan contains a 10%
renewable energy target by 2020, which, together with other qualifying
alternative energy and energy efficiency measures, will exceed the clean energy
requirements currently in effect in our states.



Limiting
Emissions through Energy Efficiency



Energy
efficiency is a high priority for us because it is a cost-effective way to
reduce CO2emissions and can delay the need to build new power plants. We work
closely with regulators, environmental groups, technical experts and others to
develop and implement efficiency and demand response programs.  We
have a 2012 goal to reduce 1,000 MW of demand and 2,250,000 MWh of energy
consumption.  Through 2009, we have achieved 152 MW and 471,000 MWh of
demand and energy reduction, respectively.



With
regulatory support from the PUCO and partial funding from the DOE, AEP Ohio’s
gridSMARTSMDemonstration Project will install 110,000 advanced electricity meters, smart
appliances, secure integrated smart grid technology, and enable plug-in hybrid
electric vehicles and other consumer systems that will help customers manage
electricity use and costs. The $150 million project, $75 million of which will
come from federal stimulus funds, is designed to reduce energy consumption by
18,000 MWh and peak demand by 15 MW over a three year period – eliminating the
equivalent of the energy needed to power 1,800 homes. To pay for this project,
the PUCO approved project trackers in customer rates that allow us to recover
costs specific to these programs in a timely manner.



Current and Projected
CO2Emissions:Our total CO2emissions
in 2008 (including our ownership in the Kyger Creek and Clifty Creek plants)
were approximately 155 million metric tons.  We estimate that our 2009
emissions were approximately 140 million metric tons. Since 2004 our cumulative
CO2emission reductions were 51 million metric tons by the end of 2008 from adjusted
baseline levels in 1998 through 2001, and will be in excess of 70 million tons
at the end of 2009.  Emissions in 2010 and beyond will be affected by
continued changes in our generation portfolio, market prices, the pace and scale
of the economic recovery in our jurisdictions, available capital, weather, and
other factors.  We expect overall increases in CO2emissions
during the 2010-2012 timeframe as our sales and generation rebound somewhat from
recession lows in 2009. However, over much of the remainder of the decade we
expect emissions growth to be relatively flat as increased fossil generation
needed to meet modest sales growth is largely offset by retirements of some
older coal-fired units and increased use of renewable energy, particularly from
wind.



Corporate
governance:Several years ago in response to a shareholder
proposal, our Board of Directors created anad hoccommittee to evaluate
our actions to mitigate the economic impact from future policies to reduce
CO2and other emissions.  Our Board of Directors continues to review
environmental issues on a regular basis and in connection with its review of our
strategic plan.  The Board of Directors is also frequently informed of
any new material environmental issues, including updates on any proposed
legislation.  The Board of Directors’ Committee on Directors and
Corporate Governance oversees our Sustainability Report, including the portion
of the report that relates to environmental issues.  Environmental
planning and policy leadership are criteria incorporated into our executive
incentive compensation plan.

Electric
and Magnetic Fields



EMF are
found everywhere there is electricity. Electric fields are created by the
presence of electric charges. Magnetic fields are produced by the flow of those
charges. This means that EMF are created by electricity flowing in transmission
and distribution lines, electrical equipment, household wiring, and
appliances.  A number of studies in the past have examined the
possibility of adverse health effects from EMF. While some of the
epidemiological studies have indicated some association between exposure to EMF
and health effects, none has produced any conclusive evidence that EMF does or
does not cause adverse health effects.



Management cannot predict the ultimate
impact of the question of EMF exposure and adverse health effects. If further
research shows that EMF exposure contributes to increased risk of cancer or
other health problems, or if the courts conclude that EMF exposure harms
individuals and that utilities are liable for damages, or if states limit the
strength of magnetic fields to such a level that the current electricity
delivery system must be significantly changed, then the results of operations
and financial condition of AEP and its operating subsidiaries could be
materially adversely affected unless these costs can be recovered from
customers.





UTILITY
OPERATIONS



GENERAL



Utility
operations constitute most of AEP’s business operations.  Utility
operations include (i) the generation, transmission and distribution of electric
power to retail customers and (ii) the supplying and marketing of electric power
at wholesale (through the electric generation function) to other electric
utility companies, municipalities and other market
participants.  AEPSC, as agent for AEP’s public utility subsidiaries,
performs marketing, generation dispatch, fuel procurement and power-related risk
management and trading activities.



ELECTRIC
GENERATION



Facilities



AEP’s
public utility subsidiaries own or lease approximately 37,000 MW of domestic
generation. SeeItem 2 —
Propertiesfor more information regarding AEP’s generation
capacity.



AEP
Power Pool and CSW Operating Agreement



APCo,
CSPCo, I&M, KPCo, OPCo, and AEPSC are parties to the AEP Interconnection
Agreement, which has been approved by the FERC.  This agreement
defines how the member companies share the costs and benefits associated with
their generating plants. This sharing is based upon each company’s “member load
ratio.” The member load ratio is calculated monthly by dividing each company’s
highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months by the aggregate of the
highest monthly peak demand for the last twelve months for all member companies.
The member load ratio multiplied by the aggregate generation capacity of all the
member companies determines each member company's capacity
obligation.  The difference between each member company's obligation
and its own generation capacity determines the capacity surplus or deficit of
each member company.  The agreement requires the deficit companies to
make monthly capacity equalization payments to the surplus companies based on
the surplus companies' average fixed cost of generation.  Member
companies that deliver energy to other member companies to meet their internal
load requirements are reimbursed at average variable costs.  In
addition, all member companies share off-system sales margins based upon each
member company's member load ratio.  Consequently, the agreement
provides a strong risk sharing and mitigation arrangement among the member
companies.  As of December 31, 2009, the member-load-ratios were as
follows:

APCo,
CSPCo, I&M, KPCo and OPCo are parties to the AEP System Interim Allowance
Agreement (Allowance Agreement), which has been approved by the FERC and
provides, among other things, for the transfer of SO2emission
allowances associated with transactions under the Interconnection
Agreement.  The following table shows the net (credits) or charges
allocated among the parties under the Interconnection Agreement during the years
ended December 31, 2007, 2008 and 2009:

PSO,
SWEPCo and AEPSC are parties to a Restated and Amended Operating Agreement (CSW
Operating Agreement), which has been approved by the FERC. The CSW Operating
Agreement requires these public utility subsidiaries to maintain adequate annual
planning reserve margins and requires the subsidiaries that have capacity in
excess of the required margins to make such capacity available for sale to other
public utility subsidiary parties as capacity commitments. Parties are
compensated for energy delivered to the recipients based upon the deliverer’s
incremental cost plus a portion of the recipient’s savings realized by the
purchaser that avoids the use of more costly alternatives.  Revenues
and costs arising from third party sales in their region are generally shared
based on the amount of energy each west zone public utility subsidiary
contributes that is sold to third parties.  The separation of the
generation business undertaken by TCC and TNC to comply with the Texas Act has
made their business operations incompatible with the CSW Operating
Agreement.  As a result, with FERC approval, these companies as of May
1, 2006, are no longer parties to, and no longer supply generating capacity
under, the CSW Operating Agreement.



The
following table shows the net (credits) or charges allocated among the parties
under the CSW Operating Agreement during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2008

Power
generated by or allocated or provided under the Interconnection Agreement or CSW
Operating Agreement to any public utility subsidiary is primarily sold to
customers by such public utility subsidiary at rates approved by the public
utility commission in the jurisdiction of sale. SeeRegulation — RatesunderItem 1, Utility
Operations.



Under
both the Interconnection Agreement and CSW Operating Agreement, power that is
not needed to serve the native load of our public utility subsidiaries is sold
in the wholesale market by AEPSC on behalf of those subsidiaries.  SeeRisk Management and
Trading, below,for a discussion of the trading and marketing of such power.



AEP’s
System Integration Agreement provides for the integration and coordination of
AEP’s East companies, PSO and SWEPCO. This includes joint dispatch of generation
within the AEP System and the distribution, between the two zones, of costs and
benefits associated with the transfers of power between the two zones (including
sales to third parties and risk management and trading activities). It is
designed to function as an umbrella agreement in addition to the Interconnection
Agreement and the CSW Operating Agreement, each of which controls the
distribution of costs and benefits for activities within each
zone.  Because TCC and TNC have exited the generation business, these
two companies are no longer parties to the System Integration
Agreement.

Supply



The

      and Lignite85%86%88%Natural
      Gas6%6%6%Nuclear9%8%5%Hydroelectric
      and other<1%<1%1%



Price
increases in one or more fuel sources relative to other fuels may result in
increased use of other fuels. Variations in the generation of nuclear power are
primarily related to a 2008 forced outage caused by a low pressure turbine blade
failure event, refueling and maintenance outages.



Coal and
Lignite:AEP’s
public utility subsidiaries procure coal and lignite under a combination of
purchasing arrangements including long-term contracts, affiliate operations and
spot agreements with various producers and coal trading firms.  The
economic climate in 2009 exerted downward pressure on electric demand, resulting
in lower market prices for fuel.  This lower demand led to a
significant decrease in AEP’s coal consumption in 2009. As a result of decreased
coal consumption and corresponding increases in fuel inventory, AEP initiated
discussions with its coal suppliers in an effort to better match deliveries with
consumption and to minimize the impact on fuel inventory costs, carrying costs
and cash.



Most of
the coal purchased by AEP is procured through term
contracts.  Generally, the prices paid under these term contracts are
often lower than spot coal market prices.  As term contracts expire
they are replaced with new agreements, often at higher prices.  The
price we paid for coal delivered in 2009 rose from the prior year primarily as a
result of this contract replacement process.



The
following table shows the amount of coal and lignite delivered to the AEP System
plants during the past three years and the average delivered price of coal
purchased by AEP System companies:



200720082009Total
      coal delivered to AEP System plants (thousands of tons)72,64477,05475,909Average
      price per ton of purchased coal$36.65$47.14$49.54



Management
believes that AEP’s public utility subsidiaries will be able to secure and
transport coal and lignite of adequate quality and in adequate quantities to
operate their coal and lignite-fired units.  Through subsidiaries, AEP
owns, leases or controls more than 9,000 railcars, 697 barges, 18 towboats and a
coal handling terminal with 18 million tons of annual capacity to move and store
coal for use in our generating facilities.  See AEP River Operations
for a discussion of AEP’s for-profit coal and other dry-bulk commodity
transportation operations that are not part of AEP’s Utility Operations
segment.



The coal
supplies at AEP System plants vary from time to time depending on various
factors, including, but not limited to, demand for electric power, unit outages,
transportation infrastructure limitations, space limitations, plant coal
consumption rates, availability of acceptable coals, labor issues and weather
conditions which may interrupt production or deliveries. At December 31, 2009,
the System’s coal inventory was approximately 61 days.



In cases
of emergency or shortage, AEP has developed programs to conserve coal supplies
at its plants. Such programs have been filed and reviewed with federally
approved electric reliability organizations.  In some cases, the
relevant state regulatory agency has prescribed actions to be taken under
specified circumstances by System companies, subject to the jurisdiction of such
agency.



The FERC
has adopted regulations relating, among other things, to the circumstances under
which, in the event of fuel emergencies or shortages, it might order electric
utilities to generate and transmit electric power to other regions or systems
experiencing fuel shortages, and to ratemaking principles by which such electric
utilities would be compensated. In addition, the federal government is
authorized, under prescribed conditions, to reallocate coal and to require the
transportation thereof, for the use at power plants or major fuel-burning
installations experiencing fuel shortages.



Natural
Gas:Through its
public utility subsidiaries, AEP consumed nearly 96 billion cubic feet of
natural gas during 2009 for generating power. This represents a slight decrease
from 2008 due to reduced demand in AEP’s western jurisdictions.  Many
of the natural gas-fired power plants are connected to at least two pipelines,
which allows greater access to competitive supplies and improves delivery
reliability. A portfolio of long-term, monthly, seasonal firm and daily peaking
purchase and transportation agreements (that are entered into on a competitive
basis and based on market prices) supplies natural gas requirements for each
plant, as needed.



Nuclear:I&M has made commitments to meet the current nuclear fuel requirements of
the Cook Plant. I&M has made and will make purchases of uranium in various
forms in the spot, short-term, and mid-term markets. I&M also continues to
lease a portion of its nuclear fuel requirements.



For
purposes of the storage of high-level radioactive waste in the form of spent
nuclear fuel, I&M completed modifications to its spent nuclear fuel storage
pool more than 10 years ago. I&M anticipates that the Cook Plant has
sufficient storage capacity for its spent nuclear fuel to permit normal
operations through 2013.  I&M has entered into an agreement to
provide for onsite dry cask storage.  Initial loading of spent nuclear
fuel into the dry casks is tentatively scheduled to begin in 2012.



Nuclear
Waste and Decommissioning



As the
owner of the Cook Plant, I&M has a significant future financial commitment
to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate the plant
safely. The cost to decommission a nuclear plant is affected by NRC regulations
and the spent nuclear fuel disposal program.  In 2009, when the most
recent study was done, the estimated cost of decommissioning and disposal of
low-level radioactive waste for the Cook Plant ranged from $831 million to $1.5
billion in 2009 non-discounted dollars.  At December 31, 2009, the
total decommissioning trust fund balance for the Cook Plant was approximately
$1.1 billion.  The balance of funds available to decommission Cook
Plant will differ based on contributions and investment returns.  The
ultimate cost of retiring the Cook Plant may be materially different from
estimates and funding targets as a result of the:



·Type
      of decommissioning plan selected;



·Escalation
      of various cost elements (including, but not limited to, general inflation
      and the cost of energy);



·Further
      development of regulatory requirements governing
      decommissioning;



·Technology
      available at the time of decommissioning differing significantly from that
      assumed in studies;



·Availability
      of nuclear waste disposal facilities;
and



·Availability
      of a DOE facility for permanent storage of spent nuclear
    fuel.



Accordingly,
management is unable to provide assurance that the ultimate cost of
decommissioning the Cook Plant will not be significantly different than current
projections.  We will seek recovery from customers through our
regulated rates if actual decommissioning costs exceed our
projections.  See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements,
entitledCommitments,
Guarantees and Contingenciesunder
the headingNuclear
Contingencies, included in the 2009 Annual Reports, for information with
respect to nuclear waste and decommissioning.



Low-Level
Radioactive Waste:The LLWPA mandates that the
responsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste rests with the
individual states. Low-level radioactive waste consists largely of ordinary
refuse and other items that have come in contact with radioactive materials.
Michigan does not currently have a disposal site for such waste available.
I&M cannot predict when such a site may be available, but Utah licenses a
low-level radioactive waste disposal site which currently accepts low-level
radioactive waste from Michigan.  I&M ships some of its low level
waste to a facility in Utah. There is currently no set date limiting I&M’s
access to the Utah facility.   I&M stores the remaining type
of low-level waste onsite.  In order to have capacity for the duration
of its licensed operation of Cook Plant for onsite storage of waste not shipped
to Utah, I&M will have to modify its existing facilities sometime in the
next ten to fifteen years.



Structured
Arrangements Involving Capacity, Energy, and Ancillary Services



In
January 2000, OPCo and NPC, an affiliate of Buckeye, entered into an agreement
relating to the construction and operation of a 510 MW gas-fired electric
generating peaking facility to be owned by NPC, called the Mone
Plant.  OPCo is entitled to 100% of the power generated by the Mone
Plant, and is responsible for the fuel and other costs of the facility through
May 2012, as extended. Following that, NPC and OPCo will be entitled to 80% and
20%, respectively, of the power of the Mone Plant, and both parties will
generally be responsible for their allocable portion of the fuel and other costs
of the facility.



Certain
Power Agreements



I&M:The Unit Power Agreement
between AEGCo and I&M, dated March 31, 1982, provides for the sale by AEGCo
to I&M of all the capacity (and the energy associated therewith) available
to AEGCo at the Rockport Plant. Whether or not power is available from AEGCo,
I&M is obligated to pay a demand charge for the right to receive such power
(and an energy charge for any associated energy taken by
I&M).  The agreement will continue in effect until the last of the
lease terms of Unit 2 of the Rockport Plant has expired (currently December
2022) unless extended in specified circumstances.



Pursuant
to an assignment between I&M and KPCo, and a unit power agreement between
KPCo and AEGCo, AEGCo sells KPCo 30% of the capacity (and the energy associated
therewith) available to AEGCo from both units of the Rockport Plant. KPCo has
agreed to pay to AEGCo the amounts that I&M would have paid AEGCo under the
terms of the Unit Power Agreement between AEGCo and I&M for such
entitlement. The KPCo unit power agreement expires in December
2022.



CSPCo:The Unit Power Agreement
between AEGCo and CSPCo, dated March 15, 2007, provides for the sale by AEGCo to
CSPCo of all the capacity and associated unit contingent energy and ancillary
services available to AEGCo at the Lawrenceburg Plant that are scheduled and
dispatched by CSPCo.  CSPCo is obligated to pay a capacity charge
(whether or not power is available from the Lawrenceburg Plant), and the fuel,
operating and maintenance charges associated with the energy dispatched by
CSPCo, and to reimburse AEGCo for other costs associated with the operation and
ownership of the Lawrenceburg Plant.  The agreement will continue in
effect until December 31, 2017 unless extended as set forth in the
agreement.

ELECTRIC
TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION



General



AEP’s
public utility subsidiaries (other than AEGCo) own and operate transmission and
distribution lines and other facilities to deliver electric power. SeeItem 2—Propertiesfor more
information regarding the transmission and distribution lines. Most of the
transmission and distribution services are sold, in combination with electric
power, to retail customers of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries in their service
territories.  These sales are made at rates approved by the state
utility commissions of the states in which they operate, and in some instances,
approved by the FERC.  SeeItem 1 –Utility Operations -
Regulation—Rates. The FERC regulates and approves the rates for wholesale
transmission transactions. SeeItem 1 –Utility Operations -
Regulation—FERC.  As discussed below, some transmission
services also are separately sold to non-affiliated companies.



AEP’s
public utility subsidiaries (other than AEGCo) hold franchises or other rights
to provide electric service in various municipalities and regions in their
service areas.  In some cases, these franchises provide the utility
with the exclusive right to provide electric service.  These
franchises have varying provisions and expiration dates.  In general,
the operating companies consider their franchises to be adequate for the conduct
of their business.  For a discussion of competition in the sale of
power, seeItem 1 –Utility
Operations - Competition.



AEP
Transmission Pool



Transmission
Agreement:APCo, CSPCo, I&M,
KPCo and OPCo operate their transmission lines as a single interconnected and
coordinated system in the AEP East transmission zone and are parties to the
Transmission Agreement (TA), defining how they share the costs and benefits
associated with their relative ownership of the bulk transmission system (lines
operated at 138kV and above and stations containing extra high voltage
equipment). The TA has been approved by the FERC. Sharing under the TA is based
upon each company’s “member-load-ratio.”  The member-load-ratio is
calculated monthly by dividing such company’s highest monthly peak demand for
the last twelve months by the aggregate of the highest monthly peak demand for
the last twelve months for all east zone operating companies.  The
respective peak demands and member-load-ratios as of December 31, 2009 are set
forth above in the section titledELECTRIC GENERATION– AEP
Power Pool and CSW Operating Agreement.



In June
2009, AEP filed with FERC to amend the TA in order to add WPCo and KgPCo and to
reallocate PJM costs on an individual basis instead of on a Member-Load-Ratio
basis.  In August 2009, FERC accepted the proposed amendment to the TA
for filing, suspended it for a nominal period, to become effective on the first
day of the month after a final FERC order in the proceeding, as requested,
subject to refund.  FERC established a hearing and settlement
procedure. Settlement discussions in the case are currently
underway.



The

Transmission
Coordination Agreement, OATT, and ERCOT Protocols:PSO, SWEPCo, TNC and
AEPSC are parties to the TCA.  Under the TCA, a coordinating committee
is charged with the responsibility of (i) overseeing the coordinated planning of
the transmission facilities of the parties to the agreement, including the
performance of transmission planning studies, (ii) the interaction of such
subsidiaries with independent system operators and other regional bodies
interested in transmission planning and (iii) compliance with the terms of the
OATT filed with the FERC and the rules of the FERC relating to such
tariff.  Pursuant to the TCA, AEPSC has responsibility for monitoring
the reliability of their transmission systems and administering
the  OATT on behalf of the other parties to the agreement. The TCA
also provides for the allocation among the parties of revenues collected for
transmission and ancillary services provided under the OATT.  These
allocations have been determined by the FERC-approved OATT for the SPP (with
respect to PSO and SWEPCo) and PUCT-approved protocols for ERCOT (with respect
to TCC and TNC).



The
following table shows the net (credits) or charges allocated pursuant to the

Transmission
Services for Non-Affiliates:In addition to
providing transmission services in connection with their own power sales, AEP’s
public utility subsidiaries through RTOs also provide transmission services for
non-affiliated companies. SeeItem 1 –Utility Operations –
Electric Transmission and Distribution - Regional Transmission Organizations,below.Transmission of electric power by AEP’s public utility subsidiaries is
regulated by the FERC.



Coordination of
East and West Zone Transmission:AEP’s System
Transmission Integration Agreement provides for the integration and coordination
of the planning, operation and maintenance of the transmission facilities of AEP
East and AEP West companies. The System Transmission Integration Agreement
functions as an umbrella agreement in addition to the TA and the TCA. The System
Transmission Integration Agreement contains two service schedules that
govern:



·The
      allocation of transmission costs and revenues
  and



·The
      allocation of third-party transmission costs and revenues and System
      dispatch costs.



The
System Transmission Integration Agreement contemplates that additional service
schedules may be added as circumstances warrant.



Regional
Transmission Organizations



The AEP
East Companies are members of PJM (a FERC-approved RTO).  SWEPCo and
PSO are members of the SPP (another FERC-approved RTO).  RTOs operate,
plan and control utility transmission assets in a manner designed to provide
open access to such assets in a way that prevents discrimination between
participants owning transmission assets and those that do not. The remaining AEP
West companies (TCC and TNC) are members of ERCOT. See Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements, entitledRate Matters, included in the
2009 Annual Reports under the heading entitledRegional Transmission Rate
Proceedings at the FERCfor additional information regarding
RTOs.



REGULATION



General



Except
for transmission and/or retail generation sales in certain of its jurisdictions,
AEP’s public utility subsidiaries’ retail rates and certain other matters are
subject to traditional cost-based regulation by the state utility
commissions.  AEP’s subsidiaries are also subject to regulation by the
FERC under the FPA with respect to wholesale power and transmission service
transactions as well as certain unbundled retail transmission rates mainly in
Ohio.  I&M is subject to regulation by the NRC under the Atomic
Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to the operation of the Cook
Plant.  AEP and its public utility subsidiaries are also subject to
the regulatory provisions of EPACT, much of which is administered by the
FERC.  EPACT provides the FERC limited “backstop” transmission siting
authority as well as increased utility merger oversight.  The law also
provides incentives and funding for clean coal technologies and initiatives to
voluntarily reduce CO2emissions.



Rates



Historically,
state utility commissions have established electric service rates on a
cost-of-service basis, which is designed to allow a utility an opportunity to
recover its cost of providing service and to earn a reasonable return on its
investment used in providing that service. A utility’s cost of service generally
reflects its operating expenses, including operation and maintenance expense,
depreciation expense and taxes. State utility commissions periodically adjust
rates pursuant to a review of (i) a utility’s adjusted revenues and expenses
during a defined test period and (ii) such utility’s level of investment. Absent
a legal limitation, such as a law limiting the frequency of rate changes or
capping rates for a period of time, a state utility commission can review and
change rates on its own initiative. Some states may initiate reviews at the
request of a utility, customer, governmental or other representative of a group
of customers. Such parties may, however, agree with one another not to request
reviews of or changes to rates for a specified period of time.



Public
utilities have traditionally financed capital investments until the new asset
was placed in service.  Provided the asset was found to be a prudent
investment, it was then added to rate base and entitled to a return through rate
recovery.  Given long lead times in construction, the high costs of
plant and equipment and difficult capital markets, we are actively pursuing
strategies to accelerate rate recognition of investments and cash
flow.  AEP representatives continue to engage our state commissioners
and legislators on alternative ratemaking options to reduce regulatory lag and
enhance certainty in the process.   These options include
pre-approvals, a return on construction work in progress, rider/trackers,
securitization, formula rates and the inclusion of future test-year projections
into rates.



In many
jurisdictions, the rates of AEP’s public utility subsidiaries are generally
based on the cost of providing traditional bundled electric service (i.e.,
generation, transmission and distribution service). In the ERCOT area of Texas,
our utilities have exited the generation business and they currently charge
unbundled cost-based rates for transmission and distribution service
only.  In Ohio, rates for electric service are unbundled for
generation, transmission and distribution service.  Historically, the
state regulatory frameworks in the service area of the AEP System reflected
specified fuel costs as part of bundled (or, more recently, unbundled) rates or
incorporated fuel adjustment clauses in a utility’s rates and tariffs. Fuel
adjustment clauses permit periodic adjustments to fuel cost recovery from
customers and therefore provide protection against exposure to fuel cost
changes.



The
following state-by-state analysis summarizes the regulatory environment of
certain major jurisdictions in which AEP operates. Several public utility
subsidiaries operate in more than one jurisdiction.  See Note 4 to the
consolidated financial statements, entitledRate Matters, included in the
2009 Annual Reports, for more information regarding pending rate
matters.



Indiana:
I&M provides retail electric service in Indiana at bundled rates approved by
the IURC, with rates set on a cost-of-service basis.  Indiana provides
for timely fuel and purchased power cost recovery through a fuel cost recovery
mechanism.



Ohio:CSPCo and OPCo each operate
as a functionally separated utility and provide “default” retail electric
service to customers at unbundled rates pursuant to the Ohio
Act.  CSPCo and OPCo provide distribution services to retail customers
at cost based rates approved by the PUCO.  Transmission services are
provided at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.  CSPCo
and OPCo’s generation/supply rates are subject to their Electric Security Plans
that the PUCO modified and approved in a March 2009 order.   The
order established standard service offer rates in effect through
2011.  The order also provides a fuel adjustment clause for the
three-year period of the ESP.  The order has been appealed by various
parties to the Supreme Court of Ohio.  Although the Supreme Court of
Ohio has rejected or dismissed a number of procedural and other challenges to
the order, the order remains on appeal with that Court.



Oklahoma:PSO provides retail
electric service in Oklahoma at bundled rates approved by the
OCC.  PSO’s rates are set on a cost-of-service basis. Fuel and
purchased energy costs above or below the amount included in base rates are
recovered or refunded by applying a fuel adjustment factor to retail
kilowatt-hour sales. The factor is generally adjusted annually and is based upon
forecasted fuel and purchased energy costs. Over or under collections of fuel
costs for prior periods are returned to or recovered from customers in the year
following when new annual factors are established.



Texas:TCC has sold all of its
generation assets.  TNC has one active generation
unit.  However, all of the output from that unit is sold to a
non-utility affiliate pursuant to an agreement effective through
2027.  Retail customers in TCC’s and TNC’s ERCOT service area of Texas
are served through non-affiliated Retail Electric Providers
(“REPs”).  TCC and TNC provide transmission and distribution service
on a cost-of-service basis at rates approved by the PUCT and wholesale
transmission service under tariffs approved by the FERC consistent with PUCT
rules.  Effective September 2009, competition in the SPP area of Texas
has been delayed until certain steps defined by statute and by PUCT rule have
been accomplished. As such, the PUCT continues to approve base and fuel rates
for SWEPCo’s Texas operations on a cost of service basis.



Virginia:APCo currently provides
retail electric service in Virginia at unbundled rates approved by the
VSCC.  Virginia generally allows for timely recovery of fuel costs
through a fuel adjustment clause.  Transmission services are provided
at OATT rates based on rates established by the FERC.  APCo is
permitted to retain a minimum of 25% of the margins from its off-system sales
with the remaining margins from such sales credited against its fuel adjustment
clause factor with a true-up to actual.  In addition to base rates and
fuel cost recovery, APCo is permitted to recover a variety of costs through rate
adjustment clauses.



West
Virginia:APCo
and WPCo provide retail electric service at bundled rates approved by the WVPSC,
with rates set on a cost-of-service basis. West Virginia generally allows for
timely recovery of fuel costs through an expanded net energy clause which trues
up to actual expenses.



Other
Jurisdictions:The public utility subsidiaries of AEP also provide service at cost based
regulated bundled rates in Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana and Tennessee and
regulated unbundled rates in Michigan.  These jurisdictions provide
for the timely recovery of fuel costs through fuel adjustment clauses that
true-up to actual expenses.

(3)CSPCo’s
      and OPCo’s generation revenues are governed by its Electric Security Plans
      (ESP) filed and approved by the PUCO.  Starting in April 2009,
      the ESP became effective which authorized rate increases during the ESP
      period, subject to caps that limit the rate increases for CSPCo to 7% in
      2009, 6% in 2010 and 6% in 2011 and for OPCo to 8% in 2009, 7% in 2010 and
      8% in 2011.  Some rate components and increases are exempt from
      the cap limitations.  The ESP also provided for a fuel
      adjustment clause for the three-year period of the ESP.  CSPCo
      and OPCo provide distribution services at cost based rates approved by the
      PUCO.  Transmission services are provided at OATT rates based on
      rates established by the FERC.

restructuring.



(5)There
      is an annual $37.5 million credit established for off-system sales in base
      rates.  If the off-system sales profits exceed the amount built
      into base rates, I&M reimburses ratepayers 50% of the
      excess.



(6)There
      is an annual $24.9 million credit established for off-system sales in base
      rates.  If the monthly off-system sales profits do not meet the
      monthly level built into base rates, ratepayers reimburse KPCo 70% of the
      shortfall.  If the monthly off-system sales profits exceed the
      monthly base amount built into base rates, KPCo reimburses ratepayers 70%
      of the excess up to and including $30 million annually.  After
      $30 million, the percentage drops to
60%.

FERC





The FERC
oversees RTOs, entities created to operate, plan and control utility
transmission assets. Order 2000 also prescribes certain characteristics and
functions of acceptable RTO proposals.  The AEP East Companies are
members of PJM. SWEPCo and PSO are members of SPP.



The FERC
has jurisdiction over the issuances of securities of our public utility
subsidiaries, the acquisition of securities of utilities, the acquisition or
sale of certain utility assets, and mergers with another electric utility or
holding company.  In addition, both the FERC and state regulators are
permitted to review the books and records of any company within a holding
company system.  EPACT gives the FERC limited “backstop” transmission
siting authority as well as increased utility merger oversight.



COMPETITION



The
public utility subsidiaries of AEP, like the electric industry generally, face
competition in the sale of available power on a wholesale basis, primarily to
other public utilities and power marketers. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 was
designed, among other things, to foster competition in the wholesale market by
creating a generation market with fewer barriers to entry and mandating that all
generators have equal access to transmission services. As a result, there are
more generators able to participate in this market. The principal factors in
competing for wholesale sales are price (including fuel costs), availability of
capacity and power and reliability of service.



AEP’s
public utility subsidiaries also compete with self-generation and with
distributors of other energy sources, such as natural gas, fuel oil and coal,
within their service areas. The primary factors in such competition are price,
reliability of service and the capability of customers to utilize sources of
energy other than electric power. With respect to competing generators and
self-generation, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they
generally maintain a favorable competitive position. With respect to alternative
sources of energy, the public utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that the
reliability of their service and the limited ability of customers to substitute
other cost-effective sources for electric power place them in a favorable
competitive position, even though their prices may be higher than the costs of
some other sources of energy.



Significant
changes in the global economy have led to increased price competition for
industrial customers in the United States, including those served by the AEP
System. Some of these industrial customers have requested price reductions from
their suppliers of electric power. In addition, industrial customers that are
downsizing or reorganizing often close a facility based upon its costs, which
may include, among other things, the cost of electric power. The public utility
subsidiaries of AEP cooperate with such customers to meet their business needs
through, for example, providing various off-peak or interruptible supply options
pursuant to tariffs filed with, and approved by, the various state commissions.
Occasionally, these rates are negotiated with the customer, and then filed with
the state commissions for approval. While competition for retail electric
service is required by law in the states of Michigan and Ohio, the public
utility subsidiaries of AEP believe that they are unlikely to be materially
affected by this competition in an adverse manner.



In Ohio,
CSPCo has seen an increase in the number of customers, and their associated
loads, switching from CSPCo to generation service from other providers (although
as of December 31, 2009, the amount switching was less than 1% of CSPCo’s entire
load.)  In February 2010 the PUCO granted a retail supply subsidiary
of AEP a certificate to operate as a competitive retail electric service
provider in Ohio.



SEASONALITY



The sale
of electric power is generally a seasonal business. In many parts of the
country, demand for power peaks during the hot summer months, with market prices
also peaking at that time. In other areas, power demand peaks during the winter.
The pattern of this fluctuation may change due to the nature and location of
AEP’s facilities and the terms of power sale contracts into which AEP enters. In
addition, AEP has historically sold less power, and consequently earned less
income, when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future
could diminish AEP’s results of operations and may impact its financial
condition.  Conversely, unusually extreme weather conditions could
increase AEP’s results of operations.



AEP RIVER
OPERATIONS



Our AEP
River Operations Segment transports coal and dry bulk commodities primarily on
the Ohio, Illinois, and lower Mississippi rivers.  Almost all of our
customers are nonaffiliated third parties who obtain the transport of coal and
dry bulk commodities for various uses.  We charge these customers
market rates for the purpose of making a profit.  Depending on market
conditions and other factors, including barge availability, we permit AEP
utility subsidiary affiliates to use certain of our equipment at rates that
reflect our cost.  Our affiliated utility customers procure the
transport of coal for use as fuel in their respective generating
plants.  We charge affiliated customers rates that reflect our
costs.  AEP River Operations includes approximately 2,287 barges, 46
towboats and 26 harbor boats that we own or lease. These assets are separate
from the barges and towboats dedicated exclusively to transporting coal for use
as fuel in our own generating facilities discussed under the prior
segment.  SeeItem 1
– Utility Operations - Electric Generation —Fuel Supply—Coal and
Lignite.



Competition
within the barging industry for major commodity contracts is intense, with a
number of companies offering transportation services in the waterways we serve.
We compete with other carriers primarily on the basis of commodity shipping
rates, but also with respect tocustomer service,
available routes, value-added services (including scheduling convenience and
flexibility), information timeliness and equipment. The industry continues
to experience consolidation.   The resulting companies
increasingly offer the widespread geographic reach necessary to support major
national customers.  Demand for barging services can be seasonal,
particularly with respect to the movement of harvested agricultural commodities
(beginning in the late summer and extending through the fall).  Cold
winter weather may also limit our operations when certain of the waterways we
serve are closed.



Our
transportation operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Coast
Guard, federal laws, state laws and certain international
conventions.  Legislation has been proposed that could make our
towboats subject to inspection by the U.S. Coast Guard.



GENERATION AND
MARKETING



Our
Generation and Marketing Segment consists of non-utility generating assets and a
competitive power supply and energy trading and marketing
business.  We enter into short and long-term transactions to buy or
sell capacity, energy and ancillary services primarily in the ERCOT
market.  As of December 31, 2009, the assets utilized in this segment
included approximately 310 MW of company-owned domestic wind power
facilities,177 MW of
domestic wind power from long-term purchase power agreements and 377 MW of
coal-fired capacity which was obtained through an agreement effective through
2027 that transfers TNC’s interestin the Oklaunion power
station to AEP Energy Partners, Inc.  TNC transfered its coal-fired
generation capacity to comply with the separation requirements of the Texas
Act.  The power obtained from the Oklaunion power station is marketed
and sold in ERCOT.  We are regulated by the PUCT for transactions
inside ERCOT and by the FERC for transactions outside of ERCOT.  While
peak load in ERCOT typically occurs in the summer, we do not necessarily expect
seasonal variation in our operations.
