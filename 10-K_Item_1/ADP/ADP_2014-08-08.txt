Our future success also depends on our recruiting, hiring, developing and retaining highly qualified, motivated and diverse talent.  Predicated on these priorities, our business strategy is based upon the following three strategic pillars, which are designed to position ADP as the global market leader in HCM services:



•grow our integrated suite of cloud-based HCM, benefits, and payroll solutions to serve the U.S. market;

•invest to grow and scale our HR Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) solutions by leveraging our platforms and processes; and

MARKETS AND MARKETING METHODS



Employer Services offers its products and services in the United States and other countries.  In fiscal2014, 79% of Employer Services' revenues were from the United States, 14% were from Europe, 4% were from Canada, and 3% were from South America, Australia, and Asia.  ADP GlobalView is available to the largest multinational clients in 41 different countries and ADP Streamline is available to clients with small and midsized operations in 100 different countries.  In addition, Employer Services offers in-country payroll and human resources outsourcing solutions to both small and large clients in 33 countries.  In Canada, we are a leading provider of payroll processing (including full departmental outsourcing) and human resource administration services.  Within Europe, we have business operations supporting our in-country solutions in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.  We also offer payroll outsourcing services as well as HCM solutions in South America (in Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Peru), China, India, and Australia.  We offer wage and tax collection and remittance services in Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and France.  PEO Services offers services exclusively in the United States.



Dealer Services primarily serves automobile dealerships, which in turn may be dependent on a relatively small number of automobile manufacturers, but also serves truck, powersports (i.e., motorcycle, marine, and RV) and heavy equipment dealers, auto repair shops, used car lots, state departments of motor vehicles, vehicle manufacturers, and vehicle distributors.  Dealer Services has offerings in 100 countries across North America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and the Asia Pacific region.



We market our products and services primarily through our direct sales force.  Employer Services also markets its solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with banks and accountants, among others.  In addition, Dealer Services uses distributors to sell, implement and support its solutions in select emerging markets.  None of ADP's major business groups has a single homogenous client base or market.  While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client or industry group is material to ADP's overall revenues.  ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or major business unit of ADP is subject to unique market risk.



COMPETITION



The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive. ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of business outsourcing solutions in the world. Employer Services and PEO Services compete with other independent business outsourcing companies, companies providing enterprise resource planning services, software companies and financial institutions. In addition, another competitive factor in the industries in which Employer Services and PEO Services operate is a company's use of third party software applications or a captive in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems.  Dealer Services' competitors include full service DMS providers, such as The Reynolds & Reynolds Company (Dealer Services' largest DMS competitor in the United States and Canada), Dealertrack Technologies, Inc., and companies providing applications and services that compete with Dealer Services' non-DMS applications and services, such as Auto Trader Group, Inc. and Dealer.com, Inc.












INDUSTRY REGULATION



Our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations. In addition, many of our products and services are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain laws and regulations to which they are subject. We have developed and continue to enhance compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our products, services, and operations, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.



As one of the world's largest providers of business outsourcing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of both sensitive client data and data related to employees of our clients.  We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under both federal and state privacy and data security-related laws, including, with respect to some of our businesses such as our COBRA, flexible spending account and insurance services businesses, ADP AdvancedMD® and ADP TotalSource®, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996.  We are also subject to federal and state security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data.  Additionally, the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients.



As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients' employees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, and ADPCheck. Certain elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements. Elements of our money transmission activities outside of the United States are subject to similar laws and requirements in the countries in which we offer such services. In addition, our U.S. prepaid access (payroll card) offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act.  Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our PEO business (ADP TotalSource) is subject to various state licensing requirements.  In addition, because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients' worksite employees, we may assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws.



In addition, many of our businesses offer products and services that assist our clients in complying with certain laws and regulations to which they are subject; although the laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services.  For example, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.   Our COBRA administration services and flexible spending account services are designed to comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to, respectively, employers' benefits continuation obligations and the requirements of Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Similarly, our Tax Credits Services business, which helps clients take advantage of tax credit opportunities as they hire new employees, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits.



The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business.  See the discussion contained in the "Risk Factors" section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that may decrease our revenues and earnings.



CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS



ADP provides its services to approximately 637,000 clients. In fiscal2014, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of annual consolidated revenues.



ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients. Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client or a Dealer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to twelve months), and in some cases may exceed two years for a large GlobalView client or other large, complicated implementation.   Although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed, we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business. This is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services, and a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients.



Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue. Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions. No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP. ADP's client retention is estimated at approximately 12 years in Employer Services, approximately 7 years in PEO Services, and approximately 12 years in Dealer Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period.












SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING



During the fiscal years ended June 30,2014,2013, and2012, ADP invested approximately $834 million, $757 million, and $699 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, migration to new computing technologies and the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses.



PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT



ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its existing solutions and services. Generally, no new solution or service has a significant effect on ADP's revenues or negatively impacts its existing solutions and services, and ADP's solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.



LICENSES



ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases. ADP's business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADP's business as a whole.



NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES



ADP employed approximately 61,000 persons as ofJune 30, 2014.
