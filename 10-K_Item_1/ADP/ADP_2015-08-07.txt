Reportable Segments

ADP’s two reportable business segments are Employer Services and Professional Employer Organization (PEO) Services.  For financial data by segment and by geographic area, see Note 13 to the “Consolidated Financial Statements” contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Prior to October 1, 2014, ADP had three reportable segments, which included our former Dealer Services business.  On September 30, 2014, the Company completed the tax-free spinoff of the Dealer Services business through the distribution of all of the issued and outstanding common stock of CDK Global, Inc. (“CDK”) to the Company’s stockholders.  CDK was formed to hold the Company’s Dealer Services business and, as a result of the distribution, became an independent public company trading under the symbol “CDK” on the NASDAQ Global Select Market.

•Payroll Services

•Benefits Administration

MARKETS AND MARKETING METHODS

Employer Services’ HCM solutions are offered in more than 100 countries.  The most material markets for our HCM solutions are the United States, Canada and Europe and, for each market, we have both country-specific solutions and solutions based on our multi-country offerings, for employers of different sizes and complexities.  The major components of our HCM offering throughout these geographies are payroll, human resource outsourcing and time and attendance management. In addition, we offer wage and tax collection and remittance services in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Australia, India and China. PEO Services offers services exclusively in the United States.










We market our solutions primarily through our direct sales force.  Employer Services also markets its solutions through indirect sales channels, such as marketing relationships with banks and certified public accountants, among others.  None of ADP’s major business groups has a single homogenous client base or market. While concentrations of clients exist in specific industries, no one client or industry group is material to ADP’s overall revenues. ADP enjoys a leadership position in each of its major service offerings and does not believe any major service or major business unit of ADP is subject to unique market risk.

COMPETITION

The industries in which ADP operates are highly competitive.  ADP knows of no reliable statistics by which it can determine the number of its competitors, but it believes that it is one of the largest providers of business outsourcing solutions in the world.  Employer Services and PEO Services compete with other independent business outsourcing companies, companies providing enterprise resource planning services, software companies and financial institutions.  In addition, another competitive factor in the industries in which Employer Services and PEO Services operate is a company’s use of third-party software applications or a captive in-house function, whereby a company installs and operates its own business processing systems.

Competition for business outsourcing solutions is primarily based on service and product quality, reputation, ease of use and accessibility of technology, breadth of services and products, and price. We believe that ADP is competitive in each of these areas and that our commitment to service excellence, together with our leading-edge technology, distinguishes us from our competitors.

INDUSTRY REGULATION

Our business is subject to a wide range of complex laws and regulations.  In addition, many of our solutions are designed to assist clients with their compliance with certain laws and regulations that apply to them.  We have, and continue to enhance, compliance programs and policies to monitor and address the legal and regulatory requirements applicable to our solutions and operations, including dedicated compliance personnel and training programs.

As one of the world’s largest providers of business outsourcing solutions, our systems contain a significant amount of sensitive data related to clients, employees of our clients, vendors and our employees. We are, therefore, subject to compliance obligations under federal, state and foreign privacy and data security-related laws, including in the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 with respect to our COBRA business, our flexible spending account and insurance services businesses, ADP's AdvancedMD® and ADP TotalSource. We are also subject to foreign, federal and state security breach notification laws with respect to both our own employee data and client employee data.  Additionally, the changing nature of privacy laws in the United States, the European Union and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal information of our employees and on behalf of our clients.

As part of our payroll and payroll tax management services, we move client funds to taxing authorities and our clients’ employees via electronic transfer, direct deposit, and ADPCheck. Certain elements of our U.S. money transmission activities, including our electronic payment and prepaid access (payroll pay card) offerings, are subject to certain licensing requirements.  Elements of our money transmission activities outside of the United States are subject to similar laws and requirements in the countries in which we offer such services.  In addition, our U.S. prepaid access (payroll card) offering is subject to the anti-money laundering and reporting provisions of The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970.  Our employee screening and selection services business offers background checking services that are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our PEO business (ADP TotalSource) is subject to various state licensing requirements.  Because ADP TotalSource is a co-employer with respect to its clients’ worksite employees, we may assume certain obligations and responsibilities of an employer under federal and state tax, insurance and employment laws.

In addition, many of our businesses offer solutions that assist our clients in complying with certain laws and regulations that apply to them. Although the laws and regulations apply to our clients and not to ADP, changes in such laws or regulations may affect our operations, products and services.  For example, our HCM solutions help clients manage their compliance with certain requirements of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the United States. Our COBRA administration services and flexible spending account services in the United States are designed to comply with relevant federal guidelines relating to, respectively, employers’ benefits continuation obligations and the requirements of Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Similarly, our Tax Credit Services business, which helps clients in the United States take advantage of tax credit opportunities as they hire new employees, is based on federal, state, or local tax laws and regulations allowing for tax credits.










The foregoing description does not include an exhaustive list of the laws and regulations governing and impacting our business.  See the discussion contained in the “Risk Factors” section in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding changes in laws and regulations that may decrease our revenues and earnings.



CLIENTS AND CLIENT CONTRACTS

ADP provides its services to more than 630,000 clients. In fiscal 2015, no single client or group of affiliated clients accounted for revenues in excess of 2% of ADP’s annual consolidated revenues.

ADP is continuously in the process of performing implementation services for new clients.  Depending on the service agreement and/or the size of the client, the installation or conversion period for new clients could vary from a short period of time for a small Employer Services client (as little as 24 hours) to a longer period for a large Employer Services client with multiple deliverables (generally six to twelve months), and in some cases may exceed two years for a large GlobalView Select client or other large, complicated implementation.  Although we monitor sales that have not yet been billed or installed, we do not view this metric as material in light of the recurring nature of our business.  This is not a reported number, but it is used by management as a planning tool relating to resources needed to install services, and as a means of assessing our performance against the installation timing expectations of our clients.

Our business is typically characterized by long-term client relationships that result in recurring revenue.  Our services are provided under written price quotations or service agreements having varying terms and conditions.  No one price quotation or service agreement is material to ADP. ADP’s client retention is estimated at approximately 12 years in Employer Services, and approximately 7 years in PEO Services, and has not varied significantly from period to period.





SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING

During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, ADP invested approximately $767 million, $686 million, and $596 million, respectively, from continuing operations, in systems development and programming, which includes expenses for activities such as client migrations to our new strategic platforms, the development of new products and maintenance of our existing technologies, including purchases of new software and software licenses.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

ADP continually upgrades, enhances, and expands its existing solutions and services.  Generally, no new solution or service has a significant effect on ADP’s revenues or negatively impacts its existing solutions and services, and ADP’s solutions and services have significant remaining life cycles.

LICENSES

ADP is the licensee under a number of agreements for computer programs and databases.  ADP’s business is not dependent upon a single license or group of licenses. Third-party licenses, patents, trademarks, and franchises are not material to ADP’s business as a whole.

NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

ADP employed approximately 55,000 persons as of June 30, 2015.
