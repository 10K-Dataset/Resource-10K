We hold over 1,200 unique issued and enforceable patents, the majority of which cover GNSS based technologies and other applications such as optical and laser technology.  We generally prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products, either directly or through subsidiaries.  From time to time we license technology from third parties.  We are not dependent on any one patent and license.  We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of Trimble and its global products and services.

Competition

Our markets are highly competitive, and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future.  Within our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical, and laser suppliers such as Hexagon and Topcon, and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors.  Our hardware products are increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants from emerging markets such as China, which compete aggressively on price at the lower-priced end of the market as well as on economic nationalism.  Our integrated hardware and software products may also be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets combined with relatively inexpensive applications, which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past.  Our software solutions are also increasingly subject to competition from existing and new entrants into the marketplace, including from some companies that may have access to significantly more resources than Trimble.

Many of our products and solutions are focused on specific industries.  In each of these industries, we face competition from companies providing point solutions, or more traditionally, less technology intensive products and services.  These companies often have greater financial resources and more established and recognized brands in those industries.  Competing in vertical markets with more established industry participants requires that we successfully establish a market position, and that we market new and sometimes unfamiliar technology and automated solutions to customers that have not previously used such products.  We also increasingly offer enterprise level solutions designed to meet the specific needs of our target industries.  In doing so, we face competition from larger and more well-established providers of enterprise software and services with whom we have not previously competed.  See also "Risk Factors - We face substantial competition in our markets, which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition."

Sales and Marketing

We tailor our go-to-market strategies to the needs of our products and regional markets around the world.  In addition to direct sales, many of our products are sold worldwide primarily through indirect channels, including distributors, dealers, and authorized representatives.  Occasionally we grant exclusive rights to market certain products or within specific countries.  These channels are supported by our regional sales offices throughout the world.  We also utilize distribution alliances, OEM relationships, and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets as well as direct sales to end-users.

Seasonality of Business

Construction equipment revenue, within our Buildings and Infrastructure segment, historically have been higher in early spring.  Our agricultural equipment revenue, within our Resources and Utilities segment, have historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere.  However, overall as a company, as a result of diversification of our business across segments and the increased impact of subscription revenue, we may experience less seasonality in the future.  Changes in global macroeconomic conditions could also impact the level of seasonality we experience.



Manufacturing

We outsource the manufacturing of many of our hardware products to our key contract manufacturing partners that include Flex Ltd., Benchmark Electronics Inc., and Jabil.  Our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement, assembly, and testing.
