Patents, Licenses and Intellectual Property

We seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our technology and products through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secret laws. We have a program to file applications for and obtain patents, copyrights, and trademarks in the United States and in selected foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. We hold approximately 1000 U.S. issued and enforceable patents and approximately 400 non-U.S. patents, the majority of which cover GNSS technology and other applications such as optical and laser technology. We also own numerous trademarks and service marks that contribute to the identity and recognition of Trimble and its products and services globally. We prefer to own the intellectual property used in our products, either directly or through subsidiaries. From time to time we license technology from third parties.

Sales and Marketing

We tailor the distribution channel to the needs of our products and regional markets through a number of sales channel solutions around the world. We sell our products worldwide primarily through indirect channels including distributors, dealers  and authorized representatives; occasionally granting exclusive rights to market certain products within specific countries. This channel is supported and supplemented (where third party distribution is not available) by our regional sales offices throughout the world. We also utilize distribution alliances, OEM relationships, and joint ventures with other companies as a means to serve selected markets, as well as direct sales to end-users.

During fiscal 2013, sales to customers in the United States represented 49%, Europe represented 23%, Asia Pacific represented 14%, and other regions represented 14% of our total revenue.  During fiscal 2012, sales to customers in the United States represented 47%, Europe represented 22%, Asia Pacific represented 16%, and other regions represented 15% of our total revenue.  During fiscal 2011, sales to customers in the United States represented 45%, Europe represented 24%, Asia Pacific represented 15%, and other regions represented 16% of our total revenue.

Seasonality of Business









* Our individual segment revenue may be affected by seasonal buying patterns. Historically, the second fiscal quarter has been the strongest quarter for the Company driven by the construction buying season.

Backlog

In most of our markets, the time between order placement and shipment is short. Orders are generally placed by customers on an as-needed basis. In general, customers may cancel or reschedule orders without penalty. For these reasons, we do not believe that  backlog is a meaningful indicator of future revenue or material to understanding our business.

Manufacturing

Manufacturing of many of our GNSS products is subcontracted to Flextronics International Limited in Mexico. We utilize Flextronics for Survey, Field Solutions and Mobile Solutions products. We utilize Benchmark Electronics Inc. in China for our  Embedded Technologies and Timing  products. We utilize Jabil Mexico for our Construction and Mobile Solutions products.  Our contract manufacturing partners are responsible for significant material procurement, assembly and testing. We continue to manage product design through pilot production for the subcontracted products, and we are directly involved in qualifying suppliers and key components used in all our products. Our current contract with Flextronics continues in effect until either party gives the other ninety days written notice.

We manufacture our laser and optics-based products, as well as some of our GNSS products, at our plants in Dayton, Ohio; Danderyd, Sweden and Shanghai, China. Some of these products or portions of these products are also subcontracted to third parties for assembly.

Our design manufacturing and distribution sites in Dayton, Ohio; Sunnyvale, California; Danderyd, Sweden; Eersel, Netherlands and Shanghai, China are registered to ISO9001:2000, covering the design, production, distribution, and servicing of all our products.

Research and Development

We believe that our competitive position is maintained through the development and introduction of new products that incorporate improved features, better performance, smaller size and weight, lower cost, or some combination of these factors. We invest substantially in the development of new products. We also make significant investment in the positioning, communication and information technologies that underlie our products and will likely provide competitive advantages.

Our research and development expenditures, net of reimbursed amounts were$299.4 millionfor fiscal 2013, $256.5 million for fiscal 2012, and $197.0 million for fiscal 2011.

* We expect to continue investing in research and development with the goal of maintaining or improving our competitive position, as well as the goal of entering new markets.

Employees

At the end of fiscal 2013, we employed 7,086 employees, including 16% in manufacturing, 32% in engineering, 34% in sales and marketing, and 18% in general and administrative positions. Approximately 51% of employees are in locations outside the United States.

Some employees in Sweden are represented by unions.  Some employees in Germany and France are represented by works councils. We also employ temporary and contract personnel that are not included in the above headcount numbers. We have not experienced work stoppages or similar labor actions.
