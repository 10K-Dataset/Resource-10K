2011 and 2010, respectively, and 46%, 47% and 37% of the Company's consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively)

The
Entertainment segment consists of the CBS Television Network; CBS Television Studios and CBS Global Distribution Group (composed of CBS Studios International and CBS Television
Distribution), the Company's television production and syndication operations; CBS Films, the Company's producer and distributor of theatrical motion pictures; and CBS Interactive, the Company's

Television Network.The CBS Television Network through CBS Entertainment™, CBS News® and CBS Sports®
distributes a comprehensive schedule of news and public affairs broadcasts, sports and entertainment programming to more than 200 domestic affiliates reaching throughout the U.S., including 16
of the Company's owned and operated television stations, and to affiliated stations in certain U.S. territories.

The
CBS Television Network primarily derives revenues from the sales of advertising time for its network broadcasts. A significant portion of the advertising spots sold for the network's
non-sports programming occurs annually generally during May through July in the industry's upfront advertising market for the upcoming television broadcast season, which runs for one year
commencing in late-September. Advertisers purchase the remaining advertising spots closer to the broadcast of the related programming in the scatter advertising market. Overall advertising
revenue for the network is also impacted by audience ratings for its programming. In addition, the CBS Television Network's revenues include network affiliation fees.

CBS
Entertainment is responsible for acquiring or developing and scheduling the entertainment programming presented on the CBS Television Network, which includes primetime comedy and
drama series, reality-based programming, specials, children's programs, daytime dramas, game shows and

I-2







late-night
programs. CBS News operates a worldwide news organization, providing the CBS Television Network and the CBS Radio Network™ with regularly scheduled news and public
affairs broadcasts, including

60 Minutes®

,

48 Hours Mystery®, CBS Evening News

as well as special reports. CBS News off-network production units produce
programming for domestic and international outlets, including the CBS Television Network, cable television, home video, audio-book and in-flight markets, as well as schools and
libraries. CBS News also provides CBS Newspath®, a television news syndication service that offers daily news coverage, sports highlights and news features to the CBS Television
Network affiliates and other subscribers worldwide. CBS Sports broadcasts include

, certain games from the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball
Tournament (including the 2013 NCAA Men's Final Four), the PGA Golf Tour, Masters Tournament and PGA Championship, the U.S. Open Tennis Championships, regular-season college football and basketball
games on network television, in addition to the NFL's American Football Conference (AFC) regular-season, post-season divisional playoff and championship games. CBS Sports
has rights to broadcast the AFC through the 2013 season, including the broadcast of the 2013 Super Bowl. In December 2011, CBS extended its rights with the NFL to broadcast the AFC from the
2014 season through the 2022 season, including certain National Football Conference regular season games and the Super Bowls in 2016, 2019 and 2022. CBS Home Entertainment licenses home
video rights and CBS Consumer Products licenses merchandising rights.

The
CW, a broadcast network and the Company's 50/50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Entertainment, airs programming, includingGossip
Girl,90210, The Vampire DiariesandAmerica's Next Top Model. Eight of the
Company's owned television stations are affiliates of The CW. Certain of The CW's programming is streamed on each of Hulu, LLC and Netflix, Inc. pursuant to license agreements.

Television Production and Syndication.The Company, through CBS Television Studios and CBS Global Distribution Group (composed of
CBS Studios
International and CBS Television Distribution), produces, acquires and/or distributes programming worldwide, including series, specials, news and public affairs. Such programming is produced primarily
for broadcast on network television, exhibition on basic cable and premium subscription services or distribution via first-run syndication. First-run syndication is programming
exhibited on television stations without prior exhibition on a network or cable service. The Company subsequently distributes programming after its initial exhibition on a network, basic cable network
or premium subscription service for domestic exhibition on television stations, cable networks or video-on-demand services (known as "off-network syndicated
programming"). Off-network syndicated programming, first-run syndicated programming and programming distributed internationally can sometimes be sold in successive cycles of
sales known as "first cycle," "second cycle," sales, and so on, which may occur on exclusive or non-exclusive bases. Generally, license fees may decrease with successive sales cycles due
to increased program exhibitions.

Programming
that was produced or co-produced by the Company's production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others,

CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation

(CBS),

NCIS

(CBS),

The Good Wife

(CBS) and


(The CW).
Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period.
Remaining distribution rights, including international and/or off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions,
distribution rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or international markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the
episode; however, the Company's objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through international and domestic syndication of episodes. International sales are generally made within one year of
the U.S. network run. Generally, a series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic off-network syndication. In off-network
syndication, the Company distributes series such as

CSI:, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, Criminal Minds, NCIS

and

NCIS: Los Angeles

as well as a library of older
television programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such as

Wheel of
Fortune, Jeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, The Insider, Dr. Phil

,

Rachael Ray

and

Judge Judy

. The Company also
distributes syndicated and other programming internationally. The Company enters

I-3







into
agreements for digital streaming of its programming in the U.S. and certain other countries. The Company extended its licensing agreements with Netflix, Inc., for streaming various
programming from the Company's library on Netflix's subscription video-on-demand services in October 2012 for Canada, Latin America and the U.K, and entered into a new
agreement with Netflix for Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden in October, 2012. In November 2012, the Company entered into a non-exclusive licensing agreement with
Hulu LLC to stream various programs from the Company's library on Hulu's video-on-demand services in the U.S. In September 2011, the Company entered into a
non-exclusive licensing agreement with Hulu Japan LLC for streaming various programs from the Company's library on Hulu's subscription video-on-demand
service in Japan. In February 2011 and July 2011, the Company entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with each of Netflix, Inc. and Amazon Digital
Services, Inc., respectively, to stream various programs from the Company's library on each of Netflix's and Amazon's subscription video-on-demand services in the U.S.

Fees
for television programming licensed for syndication and digital streaming are recorded as revenues at the beginning of the license period in which the programs are made available
for exhibition, which, among other reasons, may cause substantial fluctuations in the Entertainment segment's operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were
$1.31 billion and $1.25 billion at December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011, respectively.

The
Company continues to expand its global channel presence through international joint ventures. The Company owns a 49% interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Liberty
Global, Inc., which owns and operates six cable and satellite channels in the U.K. and Ireland, includingCBS
Action™,CBS Drama™andCBS Reality™. The
Company also owns a 30% interest in a joint venture with another subsidiary of Liberty Global, which owns and operates seven cable and satellite channels in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. In
December 2012, these channels were re-launched with CBS programming and renamedCBS Action™,CBS
Drama™,CBS Reality™andCBS Europa™. In
India, the Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture with Reliance Broadcast Network Limited, which operates three English language and one Punjabi language general entertainment cable and
satellite channels customized for the Indian market and surrounding territory. In Australia, the Company owns an approximately 33% interest in a joint venture with a subsidiary of Ten Network Holdings
Limited to provide content toELEVEN™, a digital television channel service, and an approximately 33% interest in another joint venture,
which owns two cable and satellite channels calledTV1andSci Fi.

CBS Films.CBS Films produces, acquires and distributes theatrical motion pictures across all genres. The budget for each picture
is intended to be
up to $50 million plus advertising and marketing costs at a level consistent with industry custom. The majority of motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films is intended for a wide,
commercial theatrical release, similar to motion pictures typically produced and released by major studios. CBS Films' theatrical releases in 2012 wereThe Woman in
Black,Salmon Fishing in the Yemen,The WordsandSeven
Psychopaths. Theatrical releases scheduled for 2013 includeThe Last Exorcism Part II, The To Do ListandLast Vegas.

and Blu-ray Discs and electronic rental and sell-through), video-on-demand, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and
basic cable, digital media outlets and, in some cases, other channels such as airlines and hotels. CBS Films will exploit its motion pictures (including certain ancillary rights, such as licensing and
merchandising) and generate revenues in all media in the relevant release windows either directly, through affiliated CBS entities, or via third party distribution arrangements.

CBS Interactive.CBS Interactive operates one of the leading global publishers of premium content on the Internet. CBS
Interactive was ranked among
the top Internet properties in the world according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2012. CBS Interactive's leading brands, includingCNET,CBS.com,CBSSports.com,GameSpot,TV.com, CBSNews.com, ZDNet, Last.fm, andMetroLyrics.com, among others, serve targeted audiences with

approximately 280 million unique monthly visitors during December 2012 according to comScore Media Metrix, December 2012.

CBS
Interactive generates revenue principally from the sale of advertising and sponsorships, in addition to fees derived from search and commerce partners, licensing fees, subscriptions,
e-commerce activities, and other paid services. Advertising spending on the Internet, as in traditional media, fluctuates significantly with economic conditions. In addition, online
marketing spending follows seasonal consumer behavior throughout the calendar year to reflect trends during the calendar year.

Entertainment Competition.

Television Network.The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in
broadcast television are the
development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like
CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and
programming with other broadcast networks such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV, independent television stations, cable program services as well as other media, including DVDs and
Blu-ray Discs, print and the Internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned television
stations in markets across the country, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience.

Television Production and Syndication.As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios,
television production groups,
and independent producers and syndicators such as Disney, Fox, NBCUniversal, Sony and Warner Bros. to produce and sell programming both domestically and overseas. The Company also competes to obtain
creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company's entertainment businesses.

CBS Films.Motion picture production and distribution is a highly competitive business. During the life cycle of the development
and production of a
motion picture project, CBS Films must compete for the rights to compelling underlying source material and talent such as writers, producers, directors, on-screen performers and other
creative personnel. CBS Films must also compete with other buyers for the acquisition of third-party produced motion pictures. Once a motion picture is completed or acquired, CBS Films must compete
with numerous other motion pictures produced and/or distributed by various studios and independent producers including Paramount Pictures Corporation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros.
Entertainment, Inc., Lions Gate Entertainment, The Weinstein Company, Relativity Media, FilmDistrict, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and Lakeshore Entertainment

I-5







Group LLC,
among others, for audience acceptance as well as limited exhibition outlets across all of the relevant release windows. In addition, the ultimate consumer has many options for
entertainment other than motion pictures including video games, sports, travel, outdoor recreation, the Internet, and other cultural and computer-related activities.

the following: general
purpose portals such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!, especially as these properties expand their content offerings; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and Bing; online comparison shopping and retail
properties, including Shopping.com, Amazon.com and eBay; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive's brands serve, such as technology, gaming,
music, news, business, food, and lifestyle focused Websites; and platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified media
companies that provide both online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers.

distributors. Showtime Networks additionally operates the WebsiteSHO.comand various apps, which promoteShowtime, The Movie
ChannelandFlixprogramming, and provide information and entertainment and other services.

Showtime
Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to numerous MVPDs, with a substantial portion of such revenue coming from three of the largest such
distributors. The costs of acquiring exhibition rights to programming and producing original series are the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime Networks enters into commitments to
acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights forShowtimeandThe Movie Channel, from
major or independent motion picture producers and other distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda
for varying durations. For example, in addition to a motion picture output agreement with CBS Films, Showtime Networks has entered into motion picture output agreements with Buena Vista Pay
Television, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, for certain DreamWorks motion pictures, The Weinstein Company and

Emmy® Awards in 2012 (including Outstanding Drama Series),Dexter®, Shameless,Weeds,The Borgias,Nurse Jackie, The Big C, Californication, House of
LiesandEpisodes, among others. Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into
co-financing, co-production and/or distribution arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime
Networks derives revenue by licensing rights it retains in certain of its original programming. For example, Showtime Networks and its corporate affiliate(s) have entered into licenses with television
networks in various territories for exhibition of certain original series, as well as licensing arrangements with several Internet distributors, including iTunes and Amazon, among others, for certainShowtimeprogramming.

46 million subscribers as of December 31, 2012. The network derives its revenues from subscription fees and the sale of advertising. CBS Sports Network has secured carriage arrangements
with the top MVPDs.

Cable Networks Competition.

Showtime Networks.Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription program services in the
U.S.: Home Box
Office, Inc. and Starz. Competition among premium subscription program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of original series and other
original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices, marketing and advertising support
and other incentives to MVPDs for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks' premium subscription program services to subscribers. Home Box Office, Inc. is the largest
company in the U.S. premium subscription program service category, offering two premium subscription program services, HBO and Cinemax. Showtime Networks competes with Home Box Office, Inc. and
has a smaller share of the premium subscription program service category. Starz, another premium subscription program service, competes with Showtime Networks' and Home Box Office, Inc.'s
premium program services. Showtime Networks also competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with basic cable program services, broadcast television and other media, including DVDs and
Blu-ray Discs, portable devices and the Internet.

I-7







The
terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company's subscription program services are important to the Company. The effects of
consolidation among MVPDs and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach favorable terms and could have an adverse effect on revenues. In addition, new entrants, such as
Netflix, Inc., providing programming or other services for cable and/or other platforms, including the Internet, are or could be competitive with and adversely affect the Company's media
businesses, including Showtime Networks' subscription program service business.

Smithsonian
Networks competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with non-fiction and other basic cable program services, including Discovery Channel,
National Geographic Channel and History, as well as with broadcast television and other media, such as DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, portable devices and the Internet.

CBS Sports Network.CBS Sports Network principally competes with cable programming services, including other sports-oriented
cable programming
services, for distribution and license fee revenue among MVPDs, as well as for viewership and advertising revenue. The effects of consolidation among cable operators and consumer pricing sensitivity
have made it more difficult for newer channels to secure broad distribution in mainstream programming packages. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for newer sports
programming services which have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber penetration or acceptance. Re-alignment of college athletic conferences and their member institutions
may adversely impact CBS Sports Network's programming arrangements. CBS Sports Network also competes with cable programming services generally, including other sports programming services, such as
ESPN, NBC Sports Network and the FOX Sports Networks, in acquiring the television and multimedia rights to sporting events, resulting in increased rights fees and increased production expenses.

Publishing(6%, 6% and 6% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and 3%, 3% and 3% of

releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster's sales throughout the year. Simon & Schuster's top two accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue. Consumer
print books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local
economic conditions. In 2012, the sale of digital content represented approximately 23% of Simon & Schuster's revenues. The Company expects that electronic books will continue to represent an
increasing portion of Simon & Schuster revenues in the coming years.

services, through the CBS Local Digital Media group. These Websites principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising.

CBS Radio.The Company's radio broadcasting business operates through CBS Radio, one of the largest operators of radio stations
in the U.S. CBS Radio
owns and operates 127 radio stations serving 28 U.S. markets as of February 14, 2013. Virtually all of the Company's owned and operated radio stations are

I-11







located
in the 50 largest U.S. radio markets and approximately 78% in the 25 largest U.S. radio markets. Most of the Company's owned radio stations implement digital broadcasting. The Company's
strategy generally is to operate radio stations in the largest markets and take advantage of the Company's ability to sell advertising across multiple markets and formats. In June 2012, the Company
announced the creation ofCBS Sports Radio Network, which launched in January 2013 and provides up to 24-hours,
seven-days-a-week of national sports programming to affiliated radio stations. The network has more than 250 affiliates across the country and Canada, including
radio stations in 9 of the top 10 U.S. radio markets. Cumulus Media, asCBS Sports Radio Network'sexclusive syndicator, is responsible for securing
radio station affiliates and for the network's advertising sales. The Company believes that it is favorably impacted by offering radio, television and outdoor advertising platforms in large markets.
The "Radio Stations, Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table below includes information with respect to the Company's radio stations in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.

CBS
Radio's geographically dispersed stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of formats such as rock, classic hits/oldies, all-news, talk, Spanish
language, adult contemporary, top 40/contemporary hit radio, urban, sports and country, and CBS Radio has established leading franchises in news, sports and personality programming. This diversity
provides advertisers with the convenience of selecting stations to reach a targeted demographic or of selecting groups of stations to reach broad groups of consumers within and across markets and also
reduces the Company's dependence on any single station, local economy, format or advertiser. At the same time, CBS Radio maintains substantial diversity in each market where its stations operate so
that its stations can appeal to several demographic groups. CBS Radio's general programming strategies include employing popular on-air talent, some of whose broadcasts may be syndicated
by CBS Radio using the services of a third party syndicator, broadcasting programming syndicated to it by others, acquiring the rights to broadcast sports play-by-play and
producing and acquiring news content for its radio stations. The overall mix of each radio station's programming lineup is designed to fit the station's specific format and serve its local community.

The
majority of CBS Radio's revenues are generated from the sale of local and national advertising. The major categories of radio advertisers include: automotive, retail, healthcare,
telecommunications, insurance, fast food, beverage, movies and entertainment. CBS Radio is able to use the reach, diversity and branding of its radio stations to create unique
division-wide marketing and promotional initiatives for major national advertisers of products and services. Advertising expenditures by advertisers fluctuate, which has an effect on CBS
Radio's revenues.

Substantially
all of the Company's radio stations operate Websites, many of which are combined with the Websites of the Company's television stations in co-located markets,
which promote the stations' programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other services. Also, CBS Radio operates Websites for its music radio stations. All of these
Websites are part of the CBS Local Digital Media group and principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising. CBS Radio is one of the most listened to online radio providers according to Triton
Digital's monthly Top 20 Ranker for December 2012.

Local Broadcasting Competition.

CBS Television Stations.Television stations compete for programming, on-air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with
other
stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local
and national media. The owned and operated television stations' competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not
programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network
programming and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal.

I-12







CBS Radio.The Company's radio stations directly compete within their respective markets for audience, advertising revenues and
programming with
other radio stations, including those owned by other group owners such as Clear Channel Communications, Inc., Cumulus Media Inc., Emmis Communications Corporation, Entercom
Communications Corp. and Radio One, Inc. The Company's radio stations, including their Internet and streaming activities, also compete with other media, such as broadcast, cable and DBS
television, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, and the Internet, including services such as Pandora, Spotify and Rhapsody. The radio industry is also subject to competition from Sirius XM
Radio Inc., which provides digital audio services to subscribers.

The
Company's television and radio stations face increasing competition from newer technologies, including audio and visual programming delivered via the Internet, which create new ways
for individuals to watch programming and listen to music and other content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertisements. Also, an increasingly broad adoption by consumers of
portable digital devices could affect the ability of the Company's television and radio stations to attract audiences and advertisers.

Aggregate
total revenues for the Company's radio stations for 2012 were ranked #1 or #2 in four of the top five U.S. markets by metro area population (New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and
San Francisco), according to the 2012 Market Total Revenues Performance Summary of Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP.

respectively, and 7%, 8% and 7% of the Company's consolidated operating income in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively)

The
Company provides, through its Outdoor Americas businesses, advertising space on various structures, including billboards, transit shelters and benches, buses, rail systems
(in-car and structures on station platforms and terminal), mall kiosks, stadium signage, and in retail stores. It has outdoor advertising
structures in more than 100 markets in North America, including all 50 of the largest metropolitan markets in the U.S., 19 of the 20 largest metropolitan markets in Canada and all 45 of the largest
metropolitan markets in Mexico. Additionally, Outdoor has a variety of outdoor structures in Puerto Rico, Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Chile. The Company operates its Outdoor businesses throughCBS Outdoorin the U.S., Canada and South America,CBS Outernet® in the U.S. andVendor® in Mexico. The "Radio Stations, Television Stations and
Outdoor Advertising Displays" table above includes information with regard
to the Company's outdoor advertising properties in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.

The
substantial majority of Outdoor Americas' revenues is generated from providing advertising space to local, regional and national advertisers. Rates for advertising space for a
particular structure are based on supply and demand, which are influenced by the structure's exposure known as "impressions", the demographics of the particular market and the location of the
structure within that market. Commencing in January 2011, metrics for fixed structures such as billboards and transit shelters, including demographic information and audience views, are measured
through the new "Eyes On" technology administered by the Traffic Audit Bureau, an independent agency formed by a number of major owners of outdoor advertising structures, including CBS Outdoor,
advertising agencies and advertisers. These metrics facilitate the inclusion of Outdoor Americas' inventory in the planning stages of media campaigns. The major categories of
out-of-home advertisers include: entertainment, media, automotive, beverage, financial, real estate, retail, healthcare, telecommunications, restaurants, health and beauty
aids, hotels and professional services. Out-of-home media industry advertising expenditures by retailers and the entertainment industry fluctuate, which has an effect on
Outdoor Americas' revenues.

Outdoor
Americas generally operates in the billboard, transit, and retail store advertising markets. The two primary types of billboard structures are commonly referred to as "bulletins"
and "posters."

Space
on billboard structures is generally provided for periods ranging from 4 weeks to 12 months. Billboard faces are generally mounted on structures owned by Outdoor
Americas located on leased real property. Lease agreements are negotiated with both public and private landowners for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to
year-to-year, can be for terms of 10 years or longer and may provide for renewal options. There are no significant concentrations of billboard structures that are
subject to any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord.

I-16







Transit
advertising is provided on or in transit systems, including the interiors and exteriors of buses, trains and trams and at rail stations. Transit advertising contracts are
negotiated with public transit authorities and private transit operators and generally provide for payment to the transit authority of a percentage of the revenues that Outdoor Americas receives from
providing space to advertisers, a fixed payment, or the greater of a percentage of the revenues or a fixed payment. Where revenues are lower than anticipated, the minimum amount required to be paid to
a transit authority may exceed, or be a high percentage of, the revenues received by Outdoor Americas under that advertising contract.

Transit
shelters and benches reach both vehicular and pedestrian audiences. Transit shelters are usually constructed, installed and maintained by Outdoor. Most of Outdoor Americas'
transit shelter and bench contracts include revenue-sharing arrangements with a municipality or transit authority and often include minimum required payments. Such contracts usually involve a
competitive bidding process and are awarded on the basis of projected revenues to the municipality, including minimum payments, and Outdoor Americas' willingness to construct public facilities, such
as bus shelters, public toilets and information kiosks. In these negotiations, Outdoor Americas seeks to reduce minimum payment obligations on new agreements and on renewal of existing agreements.
There is no assurance that Outdoor Americas will be successful in reducing its minimum payments, entering into new agreements or renewing certain existing agreements and any such agreements may
provide a lesser return to the Company.

Newer
technologies for outdoor advertising displays, such as changeable message displays and digital billboards using light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display technology, continue
to evolve. The Company keeps apprised of and has adopted such new technologies as they evolve and mature. For
example, Outdoor is utilizing digital technology containing moving images in New York City subways and in retail outlets through CBS Outernet. Outdoor is also building new digital billboards and
digitizing the displays on previously static billboards. CBS Outernet, a leading distributor of video programming and advertising content to structures in retail stores, enables customized messaging
by region and retail environment. Generally, CBS Outernet enters into revenue-sharing arrangements with retailers.

Outdoor
Americas' business strategy involves operating in major selected markets, to grow its revenues and cash flow by being a leading provider of out-of-home
advertising in the markets it serves, controlling costs, developing and entering into new markets and using advanced technologies to build greater awareness for its clients. In addition, the Company
purchases structures within its existing markets or in contiguous markets to expand its reach. The Company believes that there will be continuing opportunities for implementing its acquisition and
development strategies given the outdoor industry's fragmentation.

In
January 2013, the Company announced that it has begun the process of converting its Outdoor Americas business into a REIT, which is subject to customary approvals.

Outdoor Competition.The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in providing
outdoor space for
advertising such as Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., JCDecaux S.A., Cemusa Inc., Titan Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company as well as hundreds of
smaller regional and local companies operating a limited number of display faces in a single or a few local markets. The Company also competes with other media, including broadcast and cable
television, radio, print media, the Internet and direct mail marketers, within their respective markets. In addition, it competes with a wide variety of out-of-home media,
including providers of advertising space in shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media and
cost-per-thousand impressions, particularly when delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other media, the outdoor
advertising industry relies on its relative cost efficiency and its ability to reach a broad segment in a specific market or to target a particular geographic area or population with a particular
demographic within that market. The Company keeps apprised of the evolution of new technologies in the industry. As new technologies such as digital billboards prove desirable to Outdoor Americas'
customers and deliver

I-17







appropriate
returns on investment, the Company could face increased competition for rights to digital billboards and costs could increase.

The
Company believes that its strong emphasis in customer service and its position as a leading provider of space for out-of-home advertising in each of its
primary markets as well as its international inventory enables it to compete effectively with the other outdoor companies, as well as other media, within those markets.

REGULATION

The Company's businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities in the
U.S. and of national, regional and local authorities in foreign countries. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are subject to change. The descriptions which
follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed
statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company's businesses.

Intellectual Property and Privacy

Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See "Intellectual Property" on
page I-23 for more information on the Company's brands).

Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Content and Piracy.Unauthorized distribution, reproduction or display of copyrighted material
over the
Internet and through physical devices without regard to content owners' copyright rights in television programming, motion pictures, clips and books, such as through pirated DVDs and
Blu-ray Discs, user-generated content, streaming, Internet downloads, file "sharing" and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners' ability
to protect and exploit their property. The Company is engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and has participated in various litigations, public relations
programs and legislative activity. In addition to these efforts, the Company continues to enter into and explore possibilities for commercial arrangements with various online providers to further
protect and exploit its content.

Copyright Law and Content.The Company derives revenues from the creation and exploitation of
creative content, for which the copyright law grants certain exclusive rights, including to reproduce, publicly perform and distribute. In the U.S., the copyright term for authored works is the life
of the author plus 70 years. For works made for hire, the copyright term is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from creation. Any changes to copyright
laws, which diminish the scope of a copyright owner's exclusive rights, could impact the Company.

Privacy.The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving,
particularly
as they relate to the Company's interactive businesses. The Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its Websites and legal and regulatory compliance
programs.

Broadcasting

General.Television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The
Communications Act
empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations' frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by
stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and to impose penalties for
violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.

I-18







Under
the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of MVPDs and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.

Indecency and Profanity Regulation.The FCC's rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any
time and indecent or profane material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the
vagueness of the FCC's indecency/profanity definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC's maximum forfeiture penalty for broadcasting
indecent or profane programming is $325,000 per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure
to act. The Company has been involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain
programming on its broadcast stations included indecent or profane material.

License Renewals.Radio and television broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications
Act requires
the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations
by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations
that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The Company has a number of pending renewal applications, nine of which have been opposed by third parties (there are two opposed renewal
applications for Radio and seven opposed renewal applications for Television Stations).

License Assignments.The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC
licensee.
Third parties may oppose the Company's applications to transfer or acquire additional broadcast licenses.

Ownership Regulation.The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have an
official position
or ownership interest, known as an "attributable" interest, above specific levels in broadcast stations as well as in other specified mass media entities. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition
of a broadcast radio or television station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC's ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the
public interest.

The
FCC adopted a notice of proposed rule-making ("NPRM") in its latest quadrennial review of broadcast ownership rules in December 2011, which is still pending. In that
NPRM, the FCC has proposed modifying the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule and eliminating the radio-television cross-ownership rule. The FCC's current ownership rules and proposed changes are
briefly summarized below.

Local Radio Ownership.The FCC's local radio ownership rule applies in all markets where the Company owns radio stations.
Under that rule, one party may own up to eight radio stations in the largest markets, no more than five of which may be either AM or FM. With a few exceptions, the rule permits the common ownership of
8 radio stations in the top 50 markets, where CBS Radio has significant holdings.Local Television Ownership.Under the FCC's local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations
in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of
an acquisition is filed with the FCC, and at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations remain in the market following the acquisition. Further, without
regard to the number of remaining independently owned television stations, the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA so long as certain signal contours of
the stations involved do not overlap. Satellite television stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a "parent" television station are

I-19







exempt
from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the "parent" station.

Television National Audience Reach Limitation.Under the FCC's national television ownership rule, one party may not own
television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of calculating the total number of television households reached by a station, the FCC attributes a UHF
television station with only 50% of the television households in its market. The Company currently owns and operates television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households
but for purposes of the national ownership limitation, the Company's reach is less than this amount applying the UHF discount in accordance with the FCC's methodology.

Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule.The radio-television cross-ownership rule limits the common ownership of radio and
television stations in the same market. The numeric limit varies according to the number of independent media voices in the market. The Company owns a combination of radio and television stations in
the Los Angeles market in excess of the limit. As required by the FCC, the Company assigned radio station KFWB-AM in Los Angeles to a divestiture trust. The Company is a beneficiary of the
trust. The trustee is operating the radio station and is responsible for selling the radio station to a third party, the closing of which would bring the Company into compliance with this
cross-ownership rule. As part of its quadrennial review of media ownership rules, the FCC has proposed to repeal this rule in favor of reliance on the local radio ownership rule and the local
television ownership rule.

Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership.The newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits the common ownership of a
broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same market absent a waiver by the FCC. As part of its quadrennial review of media ownership rules, the FCC has proposed a rule that would presume a waiver
to be consistent with the public interest if: (1) a daily newspaper sought to combine with a radio station in the same top 20 market, or (2) a daily newspaper sought to combine with a
full-power commercial television station in the same top 20 market, and the television station is not ranked among the top four television stations in the market and (b) at least
eight independently owned and operated "major media voices" would remain in the market after the combination.

Dual Network Rule.The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining.

Attribution of Ownership.

I-20







Company
and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities").

Alien Ownership.In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 20% or
more than 25%, depending on the circumstances, of the voting power or equity of the Company.

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations.The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the
retransmission of
commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, a television station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either "must carry" status, pursuant to
which the cable system's carriage of the station is mandatory, or "retransmission consent," pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and secures instead the right to
negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company's owned television stations have elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases, and, since 2006, the
Company has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.

Similarly,
federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DBS operators. DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local
television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory
copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect "must carry" or "retransmission consent" status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to
cable systems. Substantially all of the Company's owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local markets by the two major DBS operators pursuant to retransmission
consent agreements.

Children's Television Programming.Federal legislation and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be
shown on
television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and
informational programming ("E/I programming") designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program
stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display
during children's programming of Internet addresses of Websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.

Program Access.Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally
prohibited from
offering different prices, terms or conditions to competing MVPDs unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC's regulations. Until recently, the FCC's
"program access" rules also generally prohibited vertically integrated cable programmers from entering into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable operators. The FCC continues to assess the
competitive impact of such individual exclusive contracts. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC's program access attribution
rules if it owns or is owned by a cable operator in whole or in part. Cable operators for this purpose may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers.

The
Company's wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company's flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage
of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Because the Company and
Viacom Inc. are under common control by NAI, Viacom Inc.'s businesses could be attributable to the Company for purposes of the FCC's program access rules. (See Item 1A. "Risk
Factors—The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes, Which May Limit Business Opportunities").

National Broadband Plan.In response to the FCC's March 2010 National Broadband Plan, which seeks to provide affordable broadband
access throughout
the U.S., Congress passed legislation in February 2012 authorizing the FCC to conduct voluntary auctions of spectrum utilized by broadcast television stations to provide additional spectrum for
wireless broadband services. The television stations that continue their operations may have to change channels once the FCC "repacks" the broadcast spectrum dedicated to broadcast television use. The
legislation provides that the FCC will assist television stations in retaining their current coverage areas, no stations will be forced into the VHF band and a fund will be established to reimburse
broadcasters for reasonable relocation expenses relating to the spectrum-repacking. In September 2012, the FCC launched a rule-making proceeding to implement the auction legislation and
auctions are expected to occur in 2014, followed by the repacking process.

Outdoor Americas

The outdoor advertising industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and
to national, regional and local restrictions in foreign countries. These regulations can affect the operation of outdoor structures and include restrictions on the construction, repair, operation,
upgrading, height, size and location of outdoor structures and, in some instances, the content of advertising copy that can be displayed on these structures. In addition, outdoor advertising is the
subject of targeted state and municipal taxes and fees. These laws may affect competitive conditions in various markets in various ways. Such laws may reduce the Company's expansion opportunities, or
may increase or reduce competitive pressure
from others. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations and the enforcement thereof will not materially and adversely affect the Outdoor Americas business.

U.S.
law neither requires nor prohibits removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does require payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a
lawful billboard along a primary or interstate highway that was built with federal financial assistance. State governments have purchased and removed legal billboards for beautification objectives in
the past using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and may do so in the future. State government authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove
billboards. Thus far, Outdoor Americas has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for its billboards purchased or removed as a result of this type of

I-22







governmental
action, although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future. Local governments do not generally purchase billboards for beautification, but some have
attempted to force removal of legal but nonconforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations) after
a period of years under a concept called amortization. Under this concept the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over time. Although
there is some question as to the legality of amortization under federal and many state laws, amortization has been
upheld in some instances. Outdoor Americas generally has been successful in negotiating settlements with municipalities for billboards required to be removed. Restrictive regulations also limit
Outdoor Americas' ability to rebuild or replace nonconforming billboards.

As
the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities in outdoor advertising operations, the Company must comply with various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign
environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. The Company and its properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of
hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety, as well as zoning and other land use restrictions which may affect, among other things, the type of display, such as
digital, tri-vision or static, the hours of operation and illumination as well as methods and conditions of maintenance of facilities and advertising installation. Historically, the
Company has not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws. However, future laws or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws could require the Company to make
significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict its ability to use or operate some of its outdoor structures.

Certain
products, services and types of displays are or may be targeted by federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, tobacco products have been banned from outdoor
advertising. In addition, state and local governments continue to initiate proposals designed to limit outdoor advertising of alcohol. Legislation regulating alcohol-related advertising due to
content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in Outdoor Americas' direct revenue from such advertisements and a simultaneous increase in the available space on the existing inventory of
billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.
