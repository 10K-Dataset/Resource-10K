Distribution,
produces, acquires and/or distributes programming worldwide, including series, specials, news and public affairs. Such programming is produced primarily for broadcast on network television, exhibition
on basic cable and premium subscription services or distribution via first-run syndication. First-run syndication is programming exhibited on television stations without prior

I-2







Programming
that was produced or co-produced by the Company's production group and is broadcast on network television includes, among others,CSI:
Crime Scene Investigation(CBS),NCIS(CBS),The Good Wife(CBS) and90210(The CW).
Generally, a network will license a specified number of episodes for broadcast on the network in the U.S. during a license period.
Remaining distribution rights, including foreign and/or off-network syndication rights, are typically retained by the Company or, in the case of co-productions, distribution
rights are shared with the co-producer for U.S. or foreign markets. The network license fee for a series episode is normally lower than the costs of producing the episode; however, the
Company's objective is to recoup its costs and earn a profit through international and domestic syndication of episodes. International sales are generally made within one year of U.S. network run.
Generally, a series must have a network run of at least three or four years to be successfully sold in domestic syndication. In off-network syndication, the Company distributes series such
asCSI:, CSI: Miami, CSI: NY, Numb3rs, Criminal MindsandNCISas well as a library of older television
programs. The Company also produces and/or distributes first-run syndicated series such asJeopardy!, Entertainment Tonight, Inside Edition, The Insider,
Dr. Phil,Rachael RayandJudge Judy.The Company also distributes
syndicated programming internationally.

License
fees for completed television programming in syndication and on cable are recorded as revenues in the period that the products are available for exhibition, which, among other
reasons, may cause substantial fluctuation in the Entertainment segment's operating results. Unrecognized revenues attributable to such license agreements were approximately $654.1 million and
$387.0 million at December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

The
Company continues to expand its global channel presence through new international joint ventures. In 2010, the Company entered into a 50-50 joint venture with Reliance
Broadcast Network Limited to create three new English language general entertainment television channels customized for the Indian market and surrounding territory, the first of which,BIG CBS Prime™, launched in November 2010. Also, in 2010, the Company and a subsidiary of Ten Network Holdings Limited entered into a joint
venture to provide content toELEVEN™, a digital multichannel service which launched in Australia in January 2011. The Company owns an
approximately 33% interest in this venture. In addition, the Company owns a 50% interest in a joint venture with Chellozone (UK) Limited, a subsidiary of Liberty Global, Inc., which owns and
operates six television channels in the U.K. and Ireland, includingCBS Action™,CBS
Drama™andCBS Reality™; and an approximately 33% interest in a joint venture, which owns two pay
television channels in Australia calledTV1andSci Fi.

CBS Films.CBS Films was created in September 2007 to produce and distribute theatrical motion
pictures across all genres. The budget for each picture is intended to be up to $50 million in addition to advertising and marketing costs at a level consistent with industry custom. The
majority of motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films is intended for a wide, commercial theatrical release, similar to motion pictures typically produced and released by major studios. CBS
Films' U.S. theatrical releases in 2010 includedExtraordinary Measures,The Back-up Plan,
andFaster, which is a co-production with an affiliate of Sony Pictures Entertainment. U.S. theatrical releases in 2011 includeThe Mechanic, andBeastly, which is expected to be released in March 2011.

In
general, motion pictures produced or acquired by CBS Films are exhibited theatrically in the U.S. and internationally, followed by exploitation via home entertainment (including DVD
and electronic sell-through), video-on-demand, pay-per-view, pay television, free television and basic cable, digital media outlets and, in
some cases, other exhibitors such as airlines and hotels. CBS Films will exploit its motion pictures (including certain ancillary rights, such as licensing and merchandising) and generate revenues in
all media in the relevant release windows worldwide either directly, through affiliated CBS entities, or via third party distribution arrangements.

CBS Interactive.CBS Interactive operates one of the leading online content networks for information and entertainment. CBS
Interactive was ranked
among the top Internet properties in the world according

Entertainment Competition.

Television Network.The television broadcast environment is highly competitive. The principal methods of competition in
broadcast television are the
development and acquisition of popular programming and the development of audience interest through programming and promotion, in order to sell advertising at profitable rates. Broadcast networks like
CBS compete for audience, advertising revenues and programming with other broadcast networks such as ABC, FOX, NBC, The CW and MyNetworkTV, independent television stations, cable program services as
well as other media, including DVDs, print and the Internet. In addition, the CBS Television Network competes with the other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned
television stations in markets across the country, which are necessary to ensure the effective distribution of network programming to a nationwide audience. According to Nielsen Media Research, for
the broadcast television primetime daypart for the period September 20, 2010 to February 6, 2011, the CBS Television Network secured the #1 position for total viewers and for key adult
viewers ages 25-54 and the #2 position for adult viewers ages 18-49.

Television Production and Syndication.As a producer and distributor of programming, the Company competes with studios,
television production groups,
and independent producers and syndicators such as Disney, Sony, NBC Universal, Warner Bros. and Fox to produce and sell programming both domestically and overseas. The Company also competes to obtain
creative talent and story properties which are essential to the success of all of the Company's entertainment businesses.

CBS Films.Motion picture production and distribution is a highly competitive business. During the life cycle of the development
and production of a
motion picture project, CBS Films must compete for the

I-4









rights
to compelling underlying source material and talent such as writers, producers, directors, on screen performers and other creative personnel. Once a motion picture is completed, CBS Films must
compete with numerous other motion pictures produced by various studios and independent producers including Paramount Pictures Corporation, Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, Warner Bros.
Entertainment, Inc., Lionsgate Entertainment, Summit Entertainment, LLC, The Weinstein Company, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. and Lakeshore Entertainment Group LLC,
among others, for audience acceptance as well as limited exhibition outlets across all of the relevant release windows. In addition, the ultimate consumer has many options for entertainment other than
motion pictures including video games, sports, travel, outdoor recreation, the Internet, and other cultural and computer-related activities.

CBS Interactive.CBS Interactive competes with a variety of online properties for users, advertisers, and partners, including
the following: general
purpose portals such as AOL, MSN and Yahoo!, especially as these properties expand their content offerings; search engines such as Google, Yahoo! and MSN; online comparison shopping and retail
properties, including Shopping.com, Amazon.com and eBay; vertical content sites in the categories that CBS Interactive's brands serve, such as technology, gaming, music, news, business, food, and
lifestyle focused Web sites; and platforms such as blogs, podcasts and video properties. CBS Interactive also competes for users and advertisers with diversified media companies that provide both
online and offline content, including magazines, cable television, network television, radio and newspapers.

Cable Networks(10%, 10% and 9% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively)

The
Cable Networks segment is composed ofShowtime Networks, the Company's premium subscription program services;CBS College Sports Network, the Company's
cable network devoted to college athletics; andSmithsonian

2010,Showtime, The Movie ChannelandFlix, in the aggregate, had approximately 67.1 million
subscriptions in the U.S., certain U.S. territories and Bermuda.

Showtime
Networks also owns and operates multiplexed channels ofShowtimeandThe Movie
Channelin the U.S. which offer additional and varied programming choices. In addition, Showtime Networks transmits high definition feeds ofShowtime,
The Movie Channeland many of their multiplexed channels, and also makes versions ofShowtime, The Movie ChannelandFlixavailable
"on demand," enabling subscribers to watch selected individual programs at their convenience (in both standard and high definition in the
case ofShowtimeandThe Movie Channel, and standard definition in the case ofFlix). In October 2010,
Showtime Networks announced its plans to launchShowtime Anytime™,a
new video-streaming version ofShowtimeto be available via the Internet free of charge toShowtimesubscribers as part of theirShowtimesubscription through participating Showtime Networks' cable, direct broadcast satellite ("DBS") and telephone
company ("telco") distributors. Showtime Networks also operates the Web siteSHO.comand various mobile applications which promoteShowtime, The Movie ChannelandFlixprogramming, and provide information and entertainment and other
services.

Showtime
Networks derives revenue principally from the license of its program services to numerous cable, DBS, telco, and other distributors, with a substantial portion of such revenue
coming from three of the largest such distributors. The costs of acquiring exhibition rights to programming and producing original series are the principal expenses of Showtime Networks. Showtime
Networks enters into commitments to acquire rights, with an emphasis on acquiring exclusive rights forShowtimeandThe Movie

I-5









Channel

, from major or independent motion picture producers and other distributors typically covering the U.S. and Bermuda for varying durations. For example, in addition to a
motion picture output agreement with CBS Films, Showtime Networks has entered into motion picture output agreements with Buena Vista Pay Television, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company, for
certain DreamWorks motion pictures, The Weinstein Company and Summit Entertainment for the exclusive U.S. premium subscription television rights for certain exhibition windows relating to feature
films initially theatrically released in the U.S through December 2015 and, in the case of Summit Entertainment, December 2012. Showtime Networks' original series include

Dexter®

,

Californication

,

Nurse Jackie, Shameless, The Big C, The
Borgias

(premiering in April 2011),

Weeds

and

United States of
Tara®,

among others. Showtime Networks has entered into and may from time to time enter into co-financing, co-production and/or distribution
arrangements with other parties to reduce the net cost to Showtime Networks for its original programming. In addition, Showtime Networks derives revenue by licensing rights it retains in certain of
its original programming. For example, Showtime Networks and its corporate affiliate(s) have entered into licenses with television networks in various territories for exhibition of certain original
series, as well as electronic sell-through arrangements with several Internet distributors, including iTunes and Amazon, among others, for certain

Showtime

programming. Showtime Networks also produces
and/or provides special events to licensees on a pay-per-view basis
through

Showtime PPV®.

Showtime
Networks also owns a majority of and manages Smithsonian Networks, a venture with Smithsonian Institution, which operatesSmithsonian
Channel™, a basic cable service in the U.S., featuring programs of a cultural, historical, scientific and educational nature. Smithsonian Networks has launched both
standard and high definition versions ofSmithsonian Channel, as well as of its companion on demand version.

CBS College Sports Network.CBS College Sports Network is a 24-hour cable program service dedicated to college sports. The
network
features events from approximately 15 men's and women's college sports and provides coverage of over 250 live events each year in addition to live studio shows and original programming. CBS College
Sports Network had approximately 39.1 million subscribers as of December 31, 2010. The network derives its revenues from subscription fees and the sale of advertising time on its cable
program service. CBS College Sports Network and Comcast Corporation each owns a 50% interest inthe mtn: MountainWest Sports Network, which exhibits
Mountain West Conference athletics and is available to U.S. cable and satellite providers.

Cable Networks Competition.

Showtime Networks.Showtime Networks primarily competes with other providers of premium subscription program services in the
U.S.: Home Box
Office, Inc. and Starz Entertainment, LLC. Competition among premium subscription program services in the U.S. is dependent on: (i) the production, acquisition and packaging of
original series and other original programming and the acquisition and packaging of an adequate number of recently released theatrical motion pictures; and (ii) the offering of prices,
marketing and advertising support and other incentives to cable, DBS, telco and other distributors for carriage so as to favorably position and package Showtime Networks' premium subscription program
services to subscribers. Home Box Office, Inc. is the dominant company in the U.S. premium subscription program service category, offering two premium subscription program services, HBO and
Cinemax. Showtime Networks competes with Home Box Office, Inc. and has a smaller share of the premium subscription program service category. Starz Entertainment, LLC owns Starz, another
premium subscription program service, which competes with Showtime Networks' and Home Box Office, Inc.'s premium program services. Showtime Networks also competes for programming, distribution
and/or audiences with broadcast television, basic cable program services and other media, including DVDs, portable devices and the Internet.

I-6







The terms and favorable renewal of agreements with distributors for the distribution of the Company's subscription program services are important to the Company. Consolidation among
multichannel video programming distributors and other marketplace factors make it more difficult to reach favorable terms and could have an adverse effect on revenues. In addition, new entrants, such
as Netflix, Inc., providing programming or other services for cable and/or other platforms, including the Internet, are or could be competitive with and adversely affect the Company's media
businesses, including Showtime Networks' subscription program service business.

Smithsonian
Networks competes for programming, distribution and/or audiences with non-fiction and other basic cable program services, including Discovery Channel, National
Geographic Channel and History, as well as with broadcast television and other media, such as DVDs, portable devices and the Internet.

CBS College Sports Network.CBS College Sports Network's cable programming service principally competes with other
sports-oriented cable programming
services for cable, DBS and telco distribution and related revenue, for viewership and for advertising revenue. Consolidation among cable operators has made it more difficult for newer channels to
secure broad distribution. In addition, the largest cable providers have created sports tiers for newer sports programming services which have not, in many cases, achieved significant subscriber
penetration or acceptance. CBS College Sports Network's television service also competes with other sports programming services, such as ESPN and the FOX Sports Networks, in acquiring the television
and multimedia rights to sporting events, resulting in increased rights fees and increased production expenses.CBS College Sports Networkwill be
renamedCBS Sports Networkin April 2011.

Publishing(6% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008)

Digital™,throughSimonandSchuster.com, publishes original content, builds reader communities and promotes and sells
Simon & Schuster's books over the Internet.

I-7







The
consumer publishing marketplace is subject to increased periods of demand in the summer months and during the end-of-year holiday season. Major new title
releases represent a significant portion of Simon & Schuster's sales throughout the year. Simon & Schuster's top 10 accounts drive a significant portion of its annual revenue. Consumer
print books are generally sold on a fully returnable basis, resulting in the return of unsold books. In the domestic and international markets, the Company is subject to global trends and local
economic conditions. In 2010, the sale of
digital content represented 8.0% of Simon & Schuster's revenues. The Company expects that electronic books will represent an increasing portion of Simon & Schuster revenues in the coming
years.

Publishing Competition.

Local Broadcasting(20%, 18% and 21% of the Company's consolidated revenues in each of 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively)

The
Local Broadcasting segment is composed of CBS Television Stations, the Company's 29 owned broadcast television stations, and CBS Radio, through which the Company owns and operates
130 radio stations in 28 U.S. markets and related online properties. In 2010, the Company launched new local Web sites in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Philadelphia, among others, which

CBS Radio.The Company's radio broadcasting business operates through CBS Radio, one of the largest operators of radio stations
in the U.S. CBS Radio
owns and operates 130 radio stations serving 28 U.S. markets as of February 21, 2011. Virtually all of the Company's owned and operated radio stations are located in the 50 largest U.S. radio
markets and approximately 75% in the 25 largest U.S. radio markets. The Company's strategy generally is to operate radio stations in the largest markets and take advantage of the Company's ability to
sell advertising across multiple markets and formats. The Company believes that it is favorably impacted by offering radio, television and outdoor advertising platforms in large markets. The "Radio
Stations, Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table below includes information with respect to the Company's radio stations in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.

CBS
Radio's geographically dispersed stations serve diverse target demographics through a broad range of formats such as rock, classic hits/oldies, all-news, talk, Spanish
language, adult contemporary, top 40/contemporary hit radio, urban, sports and country, and CBS Radio has established leading franchises in

I-10









news,
sports and personality programming. This diversity provides advertisers with the convenience of selecting stations to reach a targeted demographic or of selecting groups of stations to reach
broad groups of consumers within and across markets and also reduces the Company's dependence on any single station, local economy, format or advertiser. At the same time, CBS Radio maintains
substantial diversity in each market where its stations operate so that its stations can appeal to several demographic groups. CBS Radio's general programming strategies include employing popular
on-air talent, some of whose broadcasts may be syndicated by CBS Radio using the services of a third party syndicator, broadcasting programming syndicated to it by others, acquiring the
rights to broadcast sports play-by-play and producing and acquiring news content for its radio stations. The overall mix of each radio station's programming lineup is designed
to fit the station's specific format and serve its local community. The Company also has agreements with Westwood One, Inc. involving compensation to the Company, the provision of radio
programming to CBS Radio and the distribution by Westwood One of CBS Radio News programming.

The
majority of CBS Radio's revenues are generated from the sale of local and national advertising. The major categories of radio advertisers include: automotive, retail, healthcare,
telecommunications, fast food, beverage, movies and entertainment. CBS Radio is able to use the reach, diversity and branding of its radio stations to create unique division-wide marketing
and promotional initiatives for major national advertisers of products and services. The success and reputation of CBS Radio and its stations allow the Company to attract the participation of major
artists in these national campaigns. Advertising expenditures by local advertisers fluctuate, which has an effect on CBS Radio's revenues.

Substantially
all of the Company's radio stations operate Web sites, many of which are combined with the Web sites of the Company's television stations in co-located markets, which
promote the stations'
programming, and provide news, information and entertainment, as well as other services. Also, CBS Radio operates music radio station Web sites and Radio.com, which streams the broadcast of CBS Radio
stations and powers custom channels for AOL Radio and Yahoo! Launchcast Radio. CBS Radio also operates Last.fm, a music discovery and social networking site, mp3.com, and TheStreetDate.com. These Web
sites principally derive revenues from the sale of advertising. CBS Radio is one of the most listened to online radio providers according to Ando Media's monthly Top 20 Ranker for December 2010.

Local Broadcasting Competition.

CBS Television Stations.Television stations compete for programming, on-air talent, audiences and advertising revenues with
other
stations and cable networks in their respective coverage areas and, in some cases, with respect to programming, with other station groups, and, in the case of advertising revenues, with other local
and national media. The owned and operated television stations' competitive position is largely influenced by the quality of the syndicated programs and local news programs in time periods not
programmed by the network; the strength of the CBS Television Network programming and, in particular, the viewership of the CBS Television Network in the time period immediately prior to the late
evening news; and in some cases, by the quality of the broadcast signal.

CBS Radio.The Company's radio stations directly compete within their respective markets for audience, advertising revenues and
programming with
other radio stations, including those owned by other group owners such as Clear Channel Communications, Citadel Broadcasting, Cumulus Media Inc., Emmis Communications, Entercom Communications
Corporation and Radio One. The Company's radio stations, including its Internet and streaming activities, also compete with other media, such as broadcast, cable and DBS television, other radio
stations, newspapers, magazines, direct mail, the Internet, including Internet radio services such as Pandora, Live 365 and Rhapsody. The radio industry is also subject to competition from Sirius XM
Radio Inc., which provides digital audio services to subscribers.

The
Company's television and radio stations face increasing competition from newer technologies, including audio and visual programming delivered via the Internet, which create new ways
for individuals to watch programming and listen to music and other content of their choosing while avoiding traditional

I-11









commercial
advertisements. Also, an increasingly broad adoption by consumers of portable digital devices could affect the ability of the Company's television and radio stations to attract audiences
and advertisers.

Most
of the Company's owned radio stations implement digital broadcasting. The Company believes that digital transmissions will provide listeners with improved sound quality and new
programming channels and should facilitate the convergence of radio with other digital media. It is too early to predict the full effect that the implementation of digital broadcasts will have on the
Company's radio businesses or on competition generally.

Aggregate
total revenues for the Company's radio stations for 2010 were ranked #1 in four of the top five U.S. markets by metro area population (New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and
Dallas-Fort Worth), according to the 2010 Market Total Revenues Performance Summary of Miller, Kaplan, Arase & Co., LLP.

FCC granted an application permitting the Company to assign KFWB-AM to a divestiture trust. Subsequently, a petition for reconsideration of
this grant was filed with the FCC. The petition remains pending and closing of this assignment has been delayed. Upon closing, the Company will beneficially own but will not operate
KFWB-AM. (See "CBS Business Segments—Regulation—Broadcasting—Ownership Regulation—Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule").(3)Sub-market

Outdoor(13%, 13% and 16% of the Company's consolidated revenues in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively)

The
Company sells, through its Outdoor businesses, advertising space on various media, including billboards, transit shelters, buses, rail systems (in-car, station platform
and terminal), mall kiosks and stadium signage and in retail stores. It has outdoor advertising operations in more than 100 markets in North America, including all 50 of the largest metropolitan
markets in the U.S., 19 of the 20 largest metropolitan markets in Canada and all 45 of the largest metropolitan markets in Mexico. Additionally, Outdoor has the exclusive rights to manage advertising
space on approximately 90% of the total bus fleet in the U.K. and has a variety of outdoor advertising displays in the Netherlands, France, Italy, Puerto Rico, the Republic of Ireland, Spain,
Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile and China. The Company operates its Outdoor businesses throughCBS Outdoorin the U.S., Canada, South America and
Europe,CBS Outernet®in the U.S. andVendor®in Mexico. The "Radio Stations,
Television Stations and Outdoor Advertising Displays" table above includes information with regard to the Company's outdoor advertising properties in the top 25 U.S. radio markets.

The
substantial majority of Outdoor's revenues is generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising. Advertising rates are based on supply and demand for the particular
locations, which are influenced by a particular display's exposure known as "impressions" delivered in relation to the demographics of the particular market and its location within that market. Until
recently, these impressions were not measured by independent third parties. Commencing in January 2011, impressions for all fixed display such as billboards, street furniture and transit station signs
are measured through the new "Eyes On" technology administered by the Traffic Audit Bureau, an independent agency formed by a number of major outdoor advertising vendors, advertising agencies and
advertisers. The major categories of out-of-home advertisers include: entertainment, media, automotive, beverage, financial, real estate, retail, healthcare,
telecommunications, restaurants, health and beauty aids, hotels and professional services. Out-of-home media industry advertising expenditures by retailers and the
entertainment industry fluctuate, which has an effect on Outdoor's revenues.

Outdoor
generally operates in the billboard, transit, street furniture and retail store advertising markets. Outdoor primarily operates two types of billboard advertising displays,
commonly referred to as "bulletins" and "posters."

Billboard
space is generally sold for periods ranging from 4 weeks to 12 months. Billboards are generally mounted on structures owned by Outdoor located on leased real
property. Lease agreements are negotiated with both public and private landowners for varying terms ranging from month-to-month to year-to-year, can be
for terms of 10 years or longer and may provide for renewal options. There is no significant concentration of billboards under any one lease or subject to negotiation with any one landlord.

I-15







Transit advertising includes advertising on or in transit systems, including the interiors and exteriors of buses, trains and trams and at rail stations. Transit advertising contracts
are negotiated with public transit authorities and private transit operators and generally provide for payment to the transit authority of a percentage of the revenues, a fixed payment, or the greater
of a percentage of the revenues or a fixed payment. Where revenues are lower than anticipated, the minimum amount required to be paid to a transit authority may exceed, or be a high percentage of, the
advertising revenues received by Outdoor under that advertising contract. Due to the difficult advertising marketplace worldwide, certain transit contracts, including the London Underground contract
which also has reduced revenues due to project delays, are operating at their minimum guarantee levels.

Street
furniture displays, the most common of which are bus shelters, reach both vehicular and pedestrian audiences. Bus shelters are usually constructed, installed and maintained by
Outdoor. Most of Outdoor's bus shelter contracts include revenue-sharing arrangements with a municipality or transit authority and often include minimum required payments. Street furniture contracts
usually involve a competitive bidding process. Contracts are awarded on the basis of projected revenues to the municipality, including minimum payments, and Outdoor's willingness to construct public
facilities, such as bus shelters, public toilets and information kiosks. In both its transit and street furniture negotiations, Outdoor seeks to reduce minimum payment obligations on new agreements
and on renewal of existing agreements. There is no assurance that Outdoor will be successful in reducing its minimum payments, entering into new agreements or renewing certain existing agreements and
any such agreements may provide a lesser return to the Company.

Newer
technologies for outdoor advertising displays, such as changeable message displays and digital billboards using light-emitting diode and liquid crystal display technology, continue
to evolve. The Company keeps apprised of and has adopted such new technologies as they evolve and mature. For example, Outdoor is utilizing digital technology containing moving images in the London
Underground,
New York City subways and in retail outlets through CBS Outernet. CBS Outernet, a leading distributor of video programming and advertising content to retail stores, enables customized messaging by
region and retail environment. Generally, CBS Outernet enters into revenue-sharing arrangements with retailers based on advertising sales.

Outdoor's
business strategy involves expanding its presence in major selected markets, to grow its revenues and cash flow by being a leading provider of
out-of-home advertising services in the markets it serves, controlling costs, developing and entering into new markets and using advanced technologies to build greater
awareness and promote tactical advertising. In addition, the Company purchases outdoor advertising assets within its existing markets or in contiguous markets. The Company believes that there will be
continuing opportunities for implementing its acquisition and development strategies given the outdoor advertising industry's fragmentation. This is particularly true in the international markets
where there are opportunities for Outdoor to increase profitability both from acquiring additional assets in or near its existing operations and from future acquisitions in new markets.

Outdoor Competition.The outdoor advertising industry is fragmented, consisting of several large companies involved in outdoor
advertising such as
Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, Inc., JCDecaux S.A., Cemusa Inc., Titan Outdoor Holdings, Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company as well as hundreds of smaller regional and
local companies operating a limited number of display faces in a single or a few local markets. The Company also competes with other media, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print
media, the Internet and direct mail marketers, within their respective markets. In addition, it competes with a wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in
shopping centers, airports, movie theaters, supermarkets and taxis. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media and cost-per-thousand impressions, particularly when
delivering a message to customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other media, the outdoor advertising industry relies on its relative cost efficiency and its ability to
reach a broad segment in a specific market or to target a particular geographic area or population with a particular demographic within that market. The Company keeps

I-16









apprised
of the evolution of new technologies in the industry. As new technologies such as digital billboards prove desirable to Outdoor's customers and deliver appropriate returns on investment, the
Company's costs could increase.

The
Company believes that its strong emphasis in sales and customer service and its position as a leading provider of advertising services in each of its primary markets as well as its
international inventory enables it to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising companies, as well as other media, within those markets.

REGULATION

The Company's businesses are either subject to or affected by regulations of federal, state and local governmental authorities. The
rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting these businesses are subject to change. The descriptions which follow are summaries and should be read in conjunction with the texts of the
statutes, rules and regulations described herein. The descriptions do not purport to describe all present and proposed statutes, rules and regulations affecting the Company's businesses.

Intellectual Property and Privacy

Laws affecting intellectual property are of significant importance to the Company. (See "Intellectual Property" on
page I-22).

Unauthorized Distribution of Copyrighted Content and Piracy.Unauthorized distribution, reproduction or display of copyrighted material
over the
Internet and through physical devices without regard to content owners' copyright rights in television programming, motion pictures, clips and books, such as through pirated DVDs,
user-generated content, streaming, Internet downloads, file "sharing" and peer-to-peer services, is a threat to copyright owners' ability to protect and exploit
their property. The Company is engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect its intellectual property and has participated in various litigations and public relations programs and
legislative activity. In addition to these efforts, the Company continues to enter into and explore possibilities for commercial arrangements with various online providers to further protect and
exploit its content.

Copyright Law and Content.In the U.S., the copyright term for authored works is the life of the author plus 70 years. For works
made for
hire, the copyright term is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from creation.

Privacy.The laws and regulations governing the collection, use and transfer of consumer information are complex and rapidly evolving,
particularly
as they relate to the Company's interactive businesses. The
Company monitors and considers these laws and regulations in the design and operation of its legal and regulatory compliance programs.

Broadcasting

General.Television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC pursuant to the Communications Act. The
Communications Act
empowers the FCC, among other actions, to issue, renew, revoke and modify broadcasting licenses; determine stations' frequencies, locations and operating power; regulate some of the equipment used by
stations; adopt other regulations to carry out the provisions of the Communications Act and other laws, including requirements affecting the content of broadcasts; and to impose penalties for
violation of its regulations, including monetary forfeitures, short-term renewal of licenses and, in egregious cases, license revocation or denial of license renewals.

Under
the Communications Act, the FCC also regulates certain aspects of the operation of cable and DBS systems and certain other electronic media that compete with broadcast stations.

I-17







Indecency and Profanity Regulation.The FCC's rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent or profane
material between
the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent or profane material because the vagueness of the FCC's indecency/profanity
definition makes it difficult to apply, particularly with respect to spontaneous, live programming. The FCC's maximum forfeiture penalty for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is $325,000
per indecent or profane utterance with a maximum forfeiture exposure of $3.0 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The Company is and has been
involved in litigation and, from time to time, has received and may receive in the future letters of inquiry from the FCC prompted by complaints alleging that certain programming on its broadcast
stations included indecent or profane material. (See Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition—Legal
Matters—Indecency Regulation" on page II-35).

License Renewals.Radio and television broadcast licenses are typically granted for standard terms of eight years. The Communications
Act requires
the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity and, with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations
by the licensee of either the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations and there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC's rules and regulations
that, taken together, constitute a pattern of abuse. The Company has a number of pending renewal applications, nine of which have been opposed by third parties (there are two opposed renewal
applications for Radio and seven opposed renewal applications for Television Stations).

License Assignments.The Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an
FCC licensee.
Third parties may oppose the Company's applications to transfer or acquire additional broadcast licenses.

Ownership Regulation.The Communications Act and FCC rules and regulations limit the ability of individuals and entities to have an
official position
or ownership interest, known as an "attributable" interest, above specific levels in broadcast stations as well as in other specified mass media entities. In seeking FCC approval for the acquisition
of a broadcast radio or television station license, the acquiring person or entity must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC's ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the
public interest. In December 2007, the FCC concluded a proceeding which examined whether to modify its various ownership rules, but with the exception of the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule,
the FCC declined to do so. The FCC's action was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit by the Company and other interested parties. Oral argument in this case took place
in February 2011.

The
FCC's ownership rules are briefly summarized below.

Local Radio Ownership.The FCC's local radio ownership rule applies in all markets where the Company owns radio stations.
Under that rule, one party may own up to eight radio stations in the largest markets, no more than five of which may be either AM or FM. With a few exceptions, the rule permits the common ownership of
8 radio stations in the top 50 markets, where CBS Radio has significant holdings. The Company's FM radio portfolio exceeds the FCC's numerical limit in one market, West Palm Beach, which is
grandfathered. While the rules do not require the divestiture of any existing radio ownership combinations, the Company is not permitted to transfer its radio portfolio in that market intact, except
to qualified small businesses.Local Television Ownership.Under the FCC's local television ownership rule, one party may own up to two television stations
in the same DMA, so long as at least one of the two stations is not among the top four-ranked stations in the market based on audience share as of the date an application for approval of
an acquisition is filed with the FCC, and at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations remain in the market following the acquisition. Further, without
regard to the number of remaining independently owned

I-18









television
stations, the rule permits the ownership of more than one television station within the same DMA so long as certain signal contours of the stations involved do not overlap. Satellite
television stations that simply rebroadcast the programming of a "parent" television station are exempt from the local television ownership rule if located in the same DMA as the "parent" station.

Television National Audience Reach Limitation.Under the FCC's national television ownership rule, one party may not own
television stations which reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. For purposes of calculating the total number of television households reached by a station, the FCC attributes a UHF
television station with only 50% of the television households in its market. The Company currently owns and operates television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households
but for purposes of the national ownership limitation, the Company's reach is less than this amount applying the UHF discount in accordance with the FCC's methodology.

Radio-Television Cross-Ownership Rule.The radio-television cross-ownership rule limits the common ownership of radio and
television stations in the same market. The numeric limit varies according to the number of independent media voices in the market. The Company owns a combination of radio and television stations in
the Los Angeles market in excess of the limit. The FCC granted an application permitting the Company to assign radio station KFWB-AM in Los Angeles to a divestiture trust, the closing of
which would bring the Company into compliance with the rule. A petition for reconsideration of this grant has been filed with the FCC, which remains pending, and the closing of this assignment has
been delayed.

Newspaper-Broadcast Cross-Ownership.The newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule prohibits the common ownership of a
broadcast station and daily newspaper in the same market. The FCC modified the newspaper-broadcast cross-ownership rule by establishing a presumption in favor of permitting cross-ownership of a daily
newspaper and one broadcast station (but not one of the "top four" television stations) in the top 20 markets under certain circumstances and establishing a waiver procedure for such combinations in
smaller markets. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stayed the effectiveness of this rule change. The rule in effect continues to prohibit the cross-ownership of
daily newspapers and broadcast stations in all markets absent a waiver by the FCC.

Dual Network Rule.The dual network rule prohibits any of the four major networks, ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, from combining.



Attribution of Ownership.

I-19







attributable
to the other for certain FCC purposes, which may have the effect of limiting and affecting the activities, strategic business alternatives and business terms available to the Company.
(See Item 1A. "Risk Factors—The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes").Alien Ownership.In general, the Communications Act prohibits foreign individuals or entities from owning more than 20% of
the voting power or equity of the Company.

Cable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations.The 1992 Cable Act and implementing FCC regulations govern the
retransmission of
commercial television stations by cable television operators. Every three years, a television station must elect, with respect to cable systems within its DMA, either "must carry" status, pursuant to
which the cable system's carriage of the station is mandatory, or "retransmission consent," pursuant to which the station gives up its right to mandatory carriage and secures instead the right to
negotiate consideration in return for consenting to carriage. The Company has elected the retransmission consent option in substantially all cases for the period beginning January 1, 2009, and,
since 2006, has implemented a systematic process of seeking monetary consideration for its retransmission consent.

Similarly,
federal legislation and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by DBS operators. DBS operators are required to carry the signals of all local
television broadcast stations requesting carriage in local markets in which the DBS operator carries at least one signal pursuant to the statutory local-to-local compulsory
copyright license. Every three years, each television station in such markets must elect "must carry" or "retransmission consent" status, in a manner similar to that described above with respect to
cable systems. Substantially all of the
Company's owned and operated television stations are being transmitted into their local markets by the two major DBS operators pursuant to retransmission consent agreements.

Children's Television Programming.Federal legislation and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be
shown on
television stations during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and require stations to broadcast on their main program stream three hours per week of educational and
informational programming ("E/I programming") designed for children 16 years of age and younger. FCC rules also impose E/I programming requirements on each additional digital multicast program
stream transmitted by television stations, with the requirement increasing in proportion to the additional hours of free programming offered on multicast channels. These rules also limit the display
during children's programming of Internet addresses of Web sites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.

Program Access.Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers (more fully described below) are generally
prohibited from
offering different prices, terms or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC's
regulations. The FCC's "program access" rules also limit the ability of a vertically integrated cable programmer to enter into exclusive distribution arrangements with cable operators. A cable
programmer is considered to be vertically integrated under the FCC's program access attribution rules if it owns or is owned by a cable operator in whole or in part. Cable operators for this purpose
may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers.

The
Company's wholly owned program services are not currently subject to the program access rules. The Company's flexibility to negotiate the most favorable terms available for carriage
of these services and its ability to offer cable operators exclusive programming could be adversely affected if it were to become subject to the program access rules. Because the Company and
Viacom Inc. are under common control by NAI, Viacom Inc.'s businesses could be attributable to the Company for purposes of the FCC's program access rules. (See Item 1A. "Risk
Factors—The Businesses of the Company and Viacom Inc. Will Be Attributable to the Other Company for Certain Regulatory Purposes").

I-20







Digital Radio.For a number of years, the FCC has been developing rules that would permit existing AM
and FM radio broadcast stations to broadcast digitally in order both to improve sound quality and to provide spectrum for enhanced data services to complement the existing programming service and
provide new business opportunities for radio broadcasters, including multicasting opportunities. The FCC has authorized AM and FM radio stations to broadcast digital signals using excess spectrum
within the same allotted bandwidth used for analog transmissions. In 2010, the FCC increased the maximum allowable power for digital broadcasts, which will improve the robustness and geographic
coverage of digital transmissions. As of February 1, 2011, 107 of the Company's radio stations had commenced digital broadcasts.

Outdoor

The outdoor advertising industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation at the federal, state and local levels in the U.S. and
to national, regional and local restrictions in foreign countries. These regulations can affect the operation of advertising displays and include restrictions on the construction, repair, upgrading,
height, size and location of outdoor advertising structures and, in some instances, the content of advertising copy that can be displayed on these structures. In addition, outdoor advertising is the
subject of targeted state and municipal taxes and fees. These laws may affect competitive conditions in various markets in various ways. Such laws may reduce the Company's expansion opportunities, or
may increase or reduce competitive pressure from others. No assurance can be given that existing or future laws or regulations and the enforcement thereof will not materially and adversely affect the
Outdoor business.

U.S.
law neither requires nor prohibits removal of existing lawful billboards, but it does require payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the removal of a
lawful billboard along a primary or interstate highway that was built with federal financial assistance. State governments have purchased and removed legal billboards for beautification objectives in
the past using federal funding for transportation enhancement programs, and may do so in the future. State government authorities from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove
billboards. Thus far, Outdoor has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for its billboards purchased or removed as a result of this type of governmental action, although there is no assurance
that this will continue to be the case in the future. Local governments do not generally purchase billboards for beautification, but some have attempted to

I-21









force
removal of legal but nonconforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable zoning regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations) after a period of
years under a concept called amortization. Under this concept the governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued operation of the billboard over time. Although there is some
question as to the legality of amortization under federal and many state laws, amortization has been upheld in some instances. Outdoor generally has been successful in negotiating settlements with
municipalities for billboards required to be removed. Restrictive regulations also limit Outdoor's ability to rebuild or replace nonconforming billboards.

As
the owner or operator of various real properties and facilities in outdoor advertising operations, the Company must comply with various U.S. federal, state and local and foreign
environmental, health, safety and land use laws and regulations. The Company and its properties are subject to such laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, disposal, emission and release of
hazardous and non-hazardous substances and employee health and safety, as well as zoning and other land use restrictions which may affect, among other things, the hours of operation and
illumination as well as methods and conditions of maintenance of facilities and advertising installation. Historically, the Company has not incurred significant expenditures to comply with these laws.
However, future laws or a finding of a violation of or liability under existing laws could require the Company to make significant expenditures and otherwise limit or restrict its ability to use or
operate some of its displays.

Certain
products, services and types of displays are or may be targeted by federal, state and local laws and regulations. For example, out-of-court settlements
between the major U.S. tobacco companies, the U.S. government, and all 50 states as well as regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration agency provide for a ban on the outdoor
advertising of tobacco products. In addition, state and local governments continue to initiate proposals designed to limit outdoor advertising of alcohol. Legislation regulating alcohol-related
advertising due to content-related restrictions could cause a reduction in Outdoor's direct revenue from such advertisements and a simultaneous increase in the available space on the existing
inventory of billboards in the outdoor advertising industry.
