ITEM 1. BUSINESS



GENERAL

International Paper Company (the “Company” or “International Paper,” which may also be referred to as “we” or “us”) is a global paper and packaging company with primary markets and manufacturing operations in North America, Europe, Latin America, Russia, Asia, Africa and the Middle East. We are a New York corporation, incorporated in 1941 as the successor to the New York corporation of the same name organized in 1898. Our home page on the Internet is www.internationalpaper.com. You can learn more about us by visiting that site.

In the United States, atDecember 31, 2015, the Company operated24pulp, paper and packaging mills,169converting and packaging plants,16recycling plants andthreebag facilities. Production facilities atDecember 31, 2015in Europe, Asia, Africa, India, Latin America and South America included16pulp, paper and packaging mills,67converting and packaging plants, andtworecycling plants.  We operate a printing and packaging products distribution business principally through 12 branches in Asia.  AtDecember 31, 2015, we owned or managed approximately335,000acres of forestland in Brazil and had, through licenses and forest management agreements, harvesting rights on government-owned forestlands in Russia. Substantially all of our businesses have experienced, and are likely to continue to experience, cycles relating to industry capacity and general economic conditions.

For management and financial reporting purposes, our businesses are separated into three segments: Industrial Packaging; Printing Papers; and Consumer Packaging. A description of these business segments can be found on pages 24 and 25 ofItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The Company’s50%equity interest in Ilim Holding S.A. is also a separate reportable industry segment.

From 2011 through 2015, International Paper’s capital expenditures approximated$6.6 billion, excluding mergers and acquisitions. These expenditures reflect our continuing efforts to improve product quality and environmental performance, as well as lower costs and maintain reliability of operations. Capital spending in2015was approximately$1.5 billionand is expected to be approximately$1.3 billionin2016. You can find more information about capital expenditures on page 31 ofItem 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

COMPETITION AND COSTS

The markets in the pulp, paper and packaging product lines are large and fragmented. The major markets, both U.S. and non-U.S., in which the Company sells its principal products are very competitive. Our products compete with similar products produced by other forest products companies. We also compete, in some instances, with companies in other industries and against substitutes for wood-fiber products.

Many factors influence the Company’s competitive position, including price, cost, product quality and services. You can find more information about the impact of these factors on operating profits on pages 17 through 30 ofItem 7.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

The Company operates its primary research and development center in Loveland, Ohio, as well as several product laboratories. Additionally, the Company has an interest in ArborGen, Inc., a joint venture with certain other forest products companies.

We direct research and development activities to short-term, long-term and technical assistance needs of customers and operating divisions, and to process, equipment and product innovations. Activities include product development within the operating divisions; studies on innovation and improvement of pulping, bleaching, chemical recovery, papermaking, converting and coating processes; packaging design and materials development; mechanical packaging systems, environmentally sensitive printing inks and reduction of environmental discharges; re-use of raw materials in manufacturing processes; recycling of consumer and packaging paper products; energy conservation; applications of computer controls to manufacturing operations; innovations and improvement of products; and development of various new products. Our development efforts specifically address product safety as well as the minimization of solid waste. The cost to the Company of its research and development operations was$27 millionin2015,$16 millionin2014and$18 millionin2013.

We own numerous patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our products and to the processes for their production. We also license intellectual property rights to and from others where advantageous or necessary. Many of the manufacturing processes are among our trade secrets. Some of our products are covered by U.S. and non-U.S. patents and are sold under well known trademarks. We derive a competitive advantage by protecting our trade secrets, patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and by using them as required to support our businesses.



ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION



International Paper is subject to extensive federal and state environmental regulation as well as similar regulations internationally. Our continuing objectives include: (1) controlling emissions and discharges from our facilities into the air, water and groundwater to avoid adverse impacts on the environment, and (2) maintaining compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The Company spent $93 million in 2015 for capital projects to control environmental releases into the air and water, and to assure environmentally sound management and disposal of waste.  The 2015 spend includedcosts associated with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Boiler MACT (maximum achievable control technology)regulations. We expect



to spend $118 million in 2016 for similar capital projects. Capital expenditures for 2017 environmental projects are anticipated to be approximately $114 million.  Capital expenditures for 2018 environmental projects are estimated to be $83 million.  On January 31, 2013, EPA issued the final suite of Boiler MACT regulations. These regulations require owners of specified boilers to meet revised air emissions standards for certain substances. Several lawsuits have been filed to challenge all or portions of the Boiler MACT regulations.  On December 3, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit heard oral arguments of the petitioners challenging these regulations.  As such, the projected capital expenditures for environmental projects represent our current best estimate of future expenditures with the recognition that the Boiler MACT regulations could change as a result of the pending court decision.

In the U.S., revisions to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine particulate (PM2.5) finalized between 2010 and 2012, and a promulgated revision to the NAAQS for ozone on October 1, 2015, have not had a material impact on the Company. Similarly, regulations addressing specific implementation issues related to the SO2 NAAQS were released in 2015 by the EPA and are being implemented during the next two to four years. Potentially material capital investment may be required in response to these emerging requirements, but evaluations are ongoing.





CLIMATE CHANGE



Climate change refers to any significant change in the measure of the earth’s climatic conditions such as temperature, precipitation, or winds that persist for decades or longer. Climate change can be caused by natural factors, such as changes in the sun’s intensity and ocean circulation, and human activities can also affect the composition of the earth’s atmosphere, such as from the burning of fossil fuels. In an effort to mitigate the potential of climate change impacts from human activities, various international, national and sub-national (regional, state and local) governmental actions have been undertaken. Presently, these efforts have not materially impacted International Paper, but such efforts may have a material impact on the Company in the future.



International Efforts



The 1997 Kyoto Protocol established emission reduction obligations for certain countries where the Company had and continues to have operations. Though the Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012, several countries, and most notably the European Union (EU), extended their emissions commitments until 2020. A successor program to the Kyoto Protocol is the subject











of on-going international negotiations including a Conference of the Parties (COP21) to the Kyoto Protocol. COP21 took place in December 2015 and although well short of reaching another international agreement, many countries, including the U.S. and EU member states, did establish non-binding emissions reduction targets. The U.S non-binding commitment is for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to be 26% to 28% below 2005 GHG emissions levels by 2025. Other countries in which we do business made similar non-binding commitments. The Company’s voluntary GHG reductions, which are set out in the Company’s annual Sustainability Report, are roughly in line with the percentages of the U.S. non-binding commitment. It is not clear at this time what, if any, further reductions by the Company might be required by the countries in which we operate. Due to this uncertainty, it is not possible at this time to estimate the potential impacts of future international agreements on the Company.

To assist member countries in meeting obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU established and continues to operate an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). Currently, we have two sites directly subject to regulation under Phase III of the EU ETS, one in Poland and one in France. Other sites that we operate in the EU experience indirect impacts of the EU ETS through purchased power pricing. Neither the direct nor indirect impacts of the EU ETS have been material to the Company, but they could be material to the Company in the future depending on how the 2015 non-binding commitments or allocation of and market prices for GHG credits under existing rules evolve over the coming years.

National Efforts

In the U.S., the Kyoto Protocol was not ratified and Congress has not passed GHG legislation. EPA has enacted (i) regulations to control GHGs from mobile sources (through transportation fuel efficiency standards), (ii) New Source Performance Standards (NSPS) for new Electrica Generating Units (EGUs), (iii) regulations requiring reporting of GHGs from sources of GHGs greater than 25,000 tons per year, and (iv) in 2015, requirements for states to develop plans to reduce GHGs from utility electric generating units (EGUs). In 2015, the Company reported to EPA the GHG emissions from 21 of our U.S. manufacturing sites and 9 landfills.

On November 19, 2014, EPA issued a revised draft carbon accounting framework addressing the circumstances under which biomass combustion can be considered carbon neutral. EPA has stated it intends to issue future rulemakings to address how states may use the revised framework in implementing state permit rules and in developing plans for regulating GHGs from utility electric generators. Given the uncertainties



regarding the framework and scope of future GHG rulemaking, it is unclear what impacts, if any, EPA’s actions in this area will have on the Company’s operations. To date there have been only minor permitting considerations and no substantive impacts.



In 2013, EPA issued final regulations establishing NSPS for new (EGUs). This regulation is the first of several expected NSPSs that EPA will implement over the coming years. The EPA has not yet identified the pulp and paper industry in the first phase of sectors to be covered by the new standards. However, we anticipate that at some future time pulp and paper sources may be subject to new GHG NSPS rules. It is unclear what impacts, if any, future GHG NSPS rules will have on the Company’s operations.



On August 3, 2015, EPA promulgated the Clean Power Plan (CPP) rule to address climate change by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) and other designated green house gas pollutant emissions from utility EGUs. In response, states are to develop EGU pollutant reduction plans over the next 1 to 3 years to reduce emissions over the 2022 to 2033 timeframe by about 32 percent from 2005 levels.  These plans, or the federal plan that would take effect if the states do not act, pose potential cost increases for electricity purchased by the Company. EPA estimated that the proposed rule would increase purchased electricity prices by less than seven percent, but some utilities are estimating significantly higher price increases from the final rule (11 to 14%, or more). The magnitude of the cost increase to the Company will not be possible to estimate reliably until the plans and the utility industries’ responses are better defined over the next few years. Adding to the uncertainty, states and some industry parties have filed lawsuits challenging the rule, the result of which could materially affect the scope and stringency of the regulations. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the Clean Power Plan.  The stay will remain in effect until final disposition of the case, and as such, the rule’s potential impact on the Company remains unclear.

State, Regional and Local Measures



A few U.S. states have enacted or are considering legal measures to require the reduction of emissions of GHGs by companies and public utilities, primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs. One such state is California. The Company does not have any sites currently subject to California's GHG regulatory plan. There may be indirect impacts from changing input costs (such as electricity) at some of our California converting operations but these have yet to manifest themselves in material impacts. Although we are monitoring proposed programs in other states, it is unclear what impacts, if any, state-level GHG rules will











have on the Company’s operations.  Further state measures are under substantive review as they respond to EPA’s 2015 Clean Power Plan and develop an implementation plan over the next 1 to 3 years. The CPP allows significant flexibility in how states develop their plans, so the uncertainty regarding potential impacts will remain high until more specificity is reached and individual power companies develop their compliance strategies.

Summary



Regulation of GHGs continues to evolve in various countries in which we do business. While it is likely that there will be increased governmental action regarding GHGs and climate change, any material impact to the company is not likely to occur before 2020 and at this time it is not reasonably possible to estimate Company costs of compliance with rules that have not yet been adopted or implemented and may not be adopted or implemented in the future.  In addition to possible direct impacts, future legislation and regulation could have indirect impacts on International Paper, such as higher prices for transportation, energy and other inputs, as well as more protracted air permitting processes, causing delays and higher costs to implement capital projects. International Paper has controls and procedures in place to stay informed about developments concerning possible climate change legislation and regulation in the U.S. and in other countries where we operate. We regularly assess whether such legislation or regulation may have a material effect on the Company, its operations or financial condition, and whether we have any related disclosure obligations.

Additional information regarding climate change and International Paper is available in our Sustainability Report found athttp://www.internationalpaper.com/US/ EN/Company/Sustainability/SustainabilityReport.html, though this information is not incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K and should not be considered part of this or any other report that we file with or furnish to the SEC.





EMPLOYEES

As ofDecember 31, 2015, we have approximately56,000employees, nearly34,000of whom are located in the United States. Of the U.S. employees, approximately26,000are hourly, with unions representing approximately14,000employees. Approximately11,000of this number are represented by the United Steelworkers union (USW).

International Paper, the USW, and several other unions have entered into two master agreements covering various mills and converting facilities.  These master agreements cover several specific items, including



wages, select benefit programs, successorship, employment security, and health and safety.  Individual facilities continue to have local agreements for other subjects not covered by the master agreements.  If local facility agreements are not successfully negotiated at the time of expiration, under the terms of the master agreements the local contracts will automatically renew with the same terms in effect.  The mill master agreement covers 19 of our U.S. pulp, paper, and packaging mills; the converting agreement includes 61 of our converting facilities.  In addition, International Paper is party to a master agreement with District Council 2, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, covering 13 additional converting facilities.

During 2015, local labor agreements were negotiated at five mills and 13 converting facilities. In 2016, local labor agreements are scheduled to be negotiated at 29 facilities, including four mills and 25 converting facilities.  26 of these agreements will automatically renew under the terms of the applicable master agreement if new agreements are not reached.
