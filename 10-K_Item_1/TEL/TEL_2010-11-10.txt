ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

Overview

Tyco Electronics Ltd. ("we," "Tyco Electronics," or the "Company") is a leading global provider of engineered electronic
components, network solutions, specialty products, and subsea communication systems. We design, manufacture, and market products for customers in a broad array of industries including automotive; data
communications equipment and consumer electronics; telecommunications; aerospace, defense, and marine; medical; energy; and lighting. Our products are produced in approximately 90 manufacturing sites
in over 20 countries. With approximately 7,000 engineers and worldwide manufacturing, sales, and customer service capabilities, Tyco Electronics' commitment is our customers' advantage.

Tyco
Electronics Ltd. was incorporated in Bermuda in fiscal 2000 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of then Bermuda-based Tyco International Ltd. ("Tyco International"). For the
period following its incorporation, Tyco Electronics Ltd. did not engage in any significant business activities and held minimal assets. Effective June 29, 2007, Tyco International
distributed all of its shares of Tyco Electronics to its common shareholders (referred to in this report as the "separation"). Tyco Electronics Ltd. became an independent, publicly traded
company owning the former electronics businesses of Tyco International.

Our
business was formed principally through a series of acquisitions, from fiscal 1999 through fiscal 2002, of established electronics companies and divisions, including the acquisition
of AMP Incorporated and Raychem Corporation in fiscal 1999 and the Electromechanical Components Division of Siemens and OEM Division of Thomas & Betts in fiscal 2000. These companies each have
more than 50 years of history in engineering and innovation excellence. We operated as a segment of Tyco International prior to our separation.

Effective
June 25, 2009, we discontinued our existence as a Bermuda company as provided in Section 132G of The Companies Act of 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the "Bermuda
Companies Act"), and, in accordance with article 161 of the Swiss Federal Code on International Private Law, continued our existence as a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of
the Swiss Code of Obligations. The rights of holders of our shares are governed by Swiss law, our Swiss articles of association, and our Swiss organizational regulations.

We
operate through four reporting segments: Electronic Components, Network Solutions, Specialty Products, and Subsea Communications. See Notes 1 and 24 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments.









Our
reporting segments manufacture and distribute our products and solutions to a number of end markets. The table below provides a summary of our reporting segments, the fiscal 2010 net

against Alcatel-Lucent.

Intellectual Property

Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing
know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents
and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and
monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We
own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to electrical and electronic products. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and
trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the trademarks.

While
we consider our patents and trademarks to be valued assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is dependent on patent or trademark protection or that our operations
are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents.

Employees

As of September 24, 2010, we employed approximately 89,000 people worldwide, of whom 23,000 were in the Americas region, 25,000
were in the Europe/Middle East/Africa region, and 41,000 were in










the
Asia-Pacific region. Of our total employees, approximately 55,000 were employed in manufacturing and 22,000 were represented by collective bargaining agreements. Approximately 64% of
our employees were based in lower-cost countries, primarily China. We believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory.

Government Regulation and Supervision

The import and export of products are subject to regulation by the United States and other countries. A small portion of our products,
including defense-related products, may require governmental import and export licenses, whose issuance may be influenced by geopolitical and other events. We have a trade compliance organization and
other systems in place to apply for licenses and otherwise comply with such regulations. Any failure to maintain compliance with domestic and foreign trade regulation could limit our ability to import
and export raw materials and finished goods into or from the relevant jurisdiction.

Environmental

Our operations are subject to numerous health, safety, and environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations that have
been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. We are committed to complying with these laws and to the
protection of our employees and the environment. We maintain a global environmental, health, and safety program that includes appropriate
policies and standards, staff dedicated to environmental, health, and safety issues, periodic compliance auditing, training, and other measures. We have a program for compliance with the European
Union ("EU") Restriction of Hazardous Substances and Waste Electrical and Electronics Equipment Directives, the China Restriction of Hazardous Substances law, and similar laws.

Compliance
with these laws has in the past and may in the future increase our costs of doing business in a variety of ways. For example, our costs may increase indirectly through
increased energy and product costs as producers of energy, cement, iron, steel, pulp, paper, petroleum, and other major emitters of greenhouse gases are subjected to increased or new regulation or
legislation that results in greater regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. We also have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate
environmental contamination resulting from past operations. Based upon our experience, current information, and applicable laws, we believe that it is probable that we will incur remedial costs in the
range of approximately $14 million to $24 million. As of September 24, 2010, we believe that the best estimate within this range is approximately $14 million. We do not
anticipate any material capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 for environmental control facilities or other costs of compliance with laws or regulations relating to greenhouse gas emissions.
