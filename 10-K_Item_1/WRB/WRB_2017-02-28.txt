ITEM  1.  BUSINESS



W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States and operates worldwide in two segments of the property casualty insurance business:



•Insurance- commercial insurance business, including excess and surplus lines and admitted lines, throughout the United States, as well as insurance business in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Canada, Mexico, Scandinavia, Asia and Australia; and



•Reinsurance- reinsurance business on a facultative and treaty basis, primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Australia, the Asia-Pacific region and South Africa.

Commencing with the first quarter of 2016, the Company changed the aggregation of its reported segments. Operating units in the Insurance-Domestic segment and Insurance-International segment, previously reported separately, were combined into the Insurance segment. The segment disclosures for prior periods have been revised to be consistent with the new reportable business segment presentation.

Our two reporting segments are composed of individual operating units that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or types of customers. Each of our operating units is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge about a territory or product. This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our units to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and local customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and legal staff support.

Our business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities. New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business. Of our 54 operating units, 47 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition.

Net premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), for each of our operating segments for each of the past five years were as follows:Year Ended December 31,(In thousands)20162015201420132012Net premiums written:Insurance$5,775,913$5,591,397$5,345,663$4,750,572$4,234,342Reinsurance648,000598,118651,284749,601664,197Total$6,423,913$6,189,515$5,996,947$5,500,173$4,898,539

Twenty-eight of our twenty-nine insurance company subsidiaries rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. ("A.M. Best") have ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings), and one is rated A (Excellent) (the third highest rating). A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “The Financial Strength Rating opinion addresses the relative ability of an insurer to meet its ongoing insurance obligations. The ratings are not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and do not address any other risk.” A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.

Our twenty-four insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) have financial strength ratings of A+ (the seventh highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).

Our Moody's ratings are A2 for Berkley Insurance Company, Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company (the sixth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).

Insurance

Our U.S.-based operating units underwrite commercial insurance business primarily throughout the United States, although many units offer coverage globally, focusing on the following general areas:



Excess & Surplus Lines: A number of our operating units are dedicated to the U.S. excess and surplus lines market. They serve a highly diverse group of customers that often have complex risk or unique exposures that typically fall outside the underwriting guidelines of the standard insurance market. Lines of business underwritten by our excess and surplus lines operating units include premises operations, commercial automobile, property, products liability and professional liability lines. Products are generally distributed through wholesale agents and brokers.



Industry Specialty: Certain other operating units focus on providing specialty coverages to customers within a particular industry that are best served by underwriters and claims professionals with specialized knowledge of that industry. They offer multiple lines of business with policies tailored to address these unique exposures, often with the flexibility of providing coverages on either an admitted or a non-admitted basis in the U.S. Each operating unit delivers its products through one or more distribution channels, including retail and wholesale agents, brokers, and managing general agents (MGAs), depending on the customer and the particular risks insured.



Product Specialty: Other operating units specialize in providing specific lines of insurance coverage, such as workers’ compensation or professional liability, to a wide range of customers. They offer insurance products, analytical tools and risk management services such as loss control and claims management that enable clients to manage their risk appropriately. Business is typically written on an admitted basis, although some units may offer non-admitted products in the U.S. and offer products internationally. Independent agents and brokers are the primary means of distribution.



Regional:Certain operating units offer standard insurance products and services focused on meeting the specific needs of a geographically differentiated customer base. Key clients of these units are small-to-midsized businesses. These regionally focused operating units provide a broad array of commercial insurance products to customers primarily in 45 states and the District of Columbia and have developed expertise in niches that reflect local economies. They are organized geographically in order to provide them with the flexibility to adapt quickly to local market conditions and customer needs.

In addition, through our non-U.S. insurance operating units, we write business in more than 60 countries worldwide, with branches or offices in 20 locations outside the United States, including the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Canada, Mexico, Scandinavia, Asia and Australia. In each of our operating territories, we have built decentralized structures that allow products and services to be tailored to each regional customer base.

Loss and Loss Expense Reserves

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among others, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.

The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Although the loss reserves included in the Company’s financial statements










represent management’s best estimates, setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.

The Company discounts its liabilities for certain workers’ compensation reserves. The amount of workers’ compensation reserves that were discounted was $1,907 million and $2,308 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The aggregate net discount for those reserves, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, was $640 million and $699 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. AtDecember 31, 2016, discount rates by year ranged from 2.0% to 6.5%, with a weighted average discount rate of 3.9%.

Substantially all  of discounted workers’ compensation reserves (97% of total discounted reserves atDecember 31, 2016) are excess workers’ compensation reserves. In order to properly match loss expenses with income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities, reserves for excess workers’ compensation business are discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These rates are determined annually based on the weighted average rate for the period.  Once established, no adjustments are made to the discount rate for that period, and any increases or decreases in loss reserves in subsequent years are discounted at the same rate, without regard to when any such adjustments are recognized. The expected loss and loss expense payout patterns subject to discounting are derived from the Company’s loss payout experience.

The Company also discounts reserves for certain other long-duration workers’ compensation reserves (representing approximately 3% of total discounted reserves atDecember 31, 2016), including reserves for quota share reinsurance and reserves related to losses regarding occupational lung disease. These reserves are discounted at statutory rates permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware.

To date, known environmental and asbestos claims have not had a material impact on the Company’s operations, because its subsidiaries generally did not insure large industrial companies that are subject to significant environmental or asbestos exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language.

The Company’s net reserves for losses and loss expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims on policies written before adoption of the absolute exclusion was $31 million at December 31, 2016 and $33 million at December 31, 2015. The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make an actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues, as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

Reinsurance

We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better with at least $1 billion in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A- (Excellent)” or better with at least $1 billion in policyholder surplus.



Regulation



U.S. Regulation

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business.

Overview. Our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums, loss expenses and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation.

Holding Company Statutes. In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase. Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations.

In addition, we must annually submit to our lead state regulator an “enterprise risk management report” which identifies the activities and circumstances of any affiliated company that might have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of our group or our U.S. licensed insurers.

Several states have also adopted changes to the holding company act that authorize U.S. insurance regulators to lead or participate in the group-wide supervision of certain international insurance groups. International standard setters, such as the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, are developing capital standards for international groups, and U.S. insurance regulators are currently working on U.S. group capital standards for insurance groups. The U.S. group capital calculation is expected to incorporate existing risk-based capital standards. It is unclear how the development of group capital measures will interact with existing capital requirements for insurance companies in the United States and with international capital standards. It is possible that we may be required to hold additional capital as a result of these developments.

Most states have adopted the National Association of Insurance Commissioners's (“NAIC”) Risk Management and Own Risk Solvency Assessment Model Act (the “ORSA Model Act”), which requires an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report (“ORSA”).  The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks.  Under ORSA, we are required to:

•regularly, no less than annually, conduct an ORSA to assess the adequacy of our risk management framework, and current and estimated projected future solvency position;

•internally document the process and results of the assessment; and



•provide a confidential high-level ORSA Summary Report annually to the Commissioner of Insurance of the State of Delaware (our lead state commissioner).












The NAIC is working on an Insurance Data Security Model Law, which would require insurers, insurance producers and other entities required to be licensed under state insurance laws to develop and maintain a written information security program, conduct risk assessments, and oversee the data security practices of third-party vendors. In addition, the New York Department of Financial Services has adopted a cybersecurity regulation that would impose significant new regulatory burdens on companies they supervise, including entities doing business in New York and operating or required to operate under a license, registration, certificate, accreditation or similar authorization. The regulation, which will become effective on March 1, 2017, would require any such company to maintain a cybersecurity program meeting certain core functions, adopt a cybersecurity policy and oversee the cybersecurity practices of third-party service providers, among other requirements.

We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these holding company statutes and compliance with the ORSA Model Act or any proposed or future cybersecurity regulations will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risk Based Capital Requirements. The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The NAIC RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any RBC action level as of December 31, 2016.

Insurance Regulatory Information System.The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios.

Guaranty Funds.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and the insolvent company's available funds are insufficient to pay policyholders and claimants the amounts to which they are entitled. The protection afforded under a state's guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums in that state. The NAIC Model Post-Assessment Guaranty Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits assessments to an insurer to 2% of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business.

Additionally, state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability “shared market,” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “FAIR” plans. In addition, some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state.

Dividends. We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled.  See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Trade Practices. State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Investment Regulation.Investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments. In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications. Investments that do not comply with these limits and qualifications are deducted in our insurance subsidiaries' calculation of their statutory capital and surplus.

Terrorism Risk Insurance.The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established a Federal program that provides for a system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. Pursuant to the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“TRIPRA”), the program has been extended for a six year period ending










Excess and Surplus Lines. The regulation of our U.S. subsidiaries' excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business, principally with respect to rates and policy forms, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future.

Federal Regulation.Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States. The Dodd-Frank Act created two new federal government bodies, the Federal Insurance Office (the “FIO”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”), which may impact the regulation of insurance. Although the FIO has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements, it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance. The FIO has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk.

Under the Dodd-Frank Act, ninety days following the date it is submitted to the U.S. Congress, the Covered Agreement may enter into force.  On the EU side, the European Council and the European Parliament must each adopt decisions approving the Covered Agreement before it can come into force. The Covered Agreement sets out, on a provision-by-provision basis, time frames for implementation. However, there is no guarantee that the Covered Agreement will come into force or that cedants will be willing to accept reduced collateral requirements.










The FIO is required to report to Congress annually on the insurance industry and any preemption actions regarding any Covered Agreement.

On December 12, 2013, the FIO delivered a report to Congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the U.S. The report recommended that, in the short term, the U.S. system of insurance regulation can be modernized through state-based improvements combined with certain federal actions. The report identified areas for direct federal involvement in international standard setting, the FIO participation in supervisory colleges which monitor the regulation of large national and internationally active insurance groups and federal pursuit of international covered agreements to afford nationally uniform treatment of reinsurance collateral requirements. The report also made several recommendations for state reform of insurance regulation including changes to the state regulation of insurance company solvency, group supervision and corporate governance. The FIO report stated that the system of U.S. insurance regulation can be modernized and improved in the short-term, while warning that if the states do not act in the near term to effectively regulate matters on a consistent and cooperative basis, in the FIO’s view there will be a greater role for federal regulation of insurance.

The FIO also can recommend to the FSOC that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the United States' financial stability in the event of the insurer's material financial distress or failure, i.e., a "systemically important financial institution."  An insurer so designated by FSOC will be subject to Federal Reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards. As of December 31, 2016, two insurance groups are subject to this supervision and heightened standards. Based upon our current business model and balance sheet, we do not believe that we will be designated by the FSOC as such an institution.  Although the potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on the U. S. insurance industry are not clear, our business could be affected by changes to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically important non-bank financial companies.

International Regulation

In the European Union, a new insurance regulatory regime governing, among other things, capital adequacy and risk management called “Solvency II” became effective on January 1, 2016. Lloyd’s applies a  capital adequacy test to all Lloyd’s syndicates, including our syndicate, that is based on Solvency II principles. Solvency II provides for the supervision of group solvency. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II.  Currently, the U.S. system of insurance regulation relating to group supervision is not deemed "equivalent" to Solvency II by European Union authorities. However, we have received a waiver from the PRA, subject to conditions, with respect to the PRA's supervision of our group, which waives the requirement on us to maintain a group solvency capital requirement as calculated under Solvency II rules. The Covered Agreement also prohibits any EU supervisor from exercising group-wide supervision at any level above the highest company organized in the country of that supervisor.

Our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in Mexico, Scandinavia, Continental Europe, South America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Canada. Generally, our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance










permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations.

Competition

The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive, with many insurance companies of various sizes, as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs, transacting business in the United States and internationally. We compete directly with a large number of these companies. Competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer. Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions.  Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit. Although insurance prices have generally increased for most lines of business since 2011, the rate of increase has declined in more recent years. That decline accelerated in 2016. Loss costs have also increased over that period of time.  With the low level of interest rates available, current price levels for certain lines of business remain below the prices required for the Company to achieve its long-term return objectives.

Competition for the Insurance business within the United States comes from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers. Our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers.  Other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers.  Additionally, direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company. Our Insurance operations compete internationally with native insurance operations both large and small, which in some cases are related to government entities, as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies.

Competition for the Reinsurance business, which is especially strong, comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic Reinsurance, Partner Re and others.

In recent years, various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, provide increasing competition, which may adversely impact our business and profitability. Further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively.

Additionally, competition from insurers and reinsurers based in tax-advantaged jurisdictions continues to increase, including from domestic-based subsidiaries of foreign-based entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses.

Employees

As of January 31, 2017, we employed 7,683 individuals. Of this number, our subsidiaries employed 7,536 persons and the remaining persons were employed at the parent company.

Other Information about the Company's Business

We maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds.

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods.

We have no customer that accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues.

Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
