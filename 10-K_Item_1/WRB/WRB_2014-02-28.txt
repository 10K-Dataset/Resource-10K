ITEM  1.  BUSINESS



W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States.  It operates in the following segments of the property casualty insurance business:



•Insurance-Domestic- commercial insurance business, including excess and surplus lines and admitted lines, primarily throughout the United States;



•Insurance-International- insurance business primarily in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Canada, Scandinavia, and Australia; and



•Reinsurance-Global- reinsurance business on a facultative and treaty basis, primarily in the United States, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Australia, and the Asia-Pacific Region.

Each of our three business segments is composed of individual operating units that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or types of customers. Each of our operating units is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge about a territory or product.  This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our units to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and local customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and legal staff support.

Our business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities.  New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business.  Of our 49 operating units, 42 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition.  Of these units, 24 have been formed since 2006.

Net premiums written, as reported based on United States generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”), for each of our operating segments for each of the past five years were as follows:Year Ended December 31,(In thousands)20132012201120102009Net premiums written:Insurance-Domestic$3,994,387$3,569,883$3,238,120$2,938,223$2,931,188Insurance-International756,185664,459551,910430,252302,594Reinsurance-Global749,601664,197567,338482,451496,313Total$5,500,173$4,898,539$4,357,368$3,850,926$3,730,095

Twenty-six of our twenty-seven insurance company subsidiaries rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) have ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings), and one is rated A (Excellent) (the third highest rating). A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “The Financial Strength Rating opinion addresses the relative ability of an insurer to meet its ongoing insurance obligations. The ratings are not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and do not address any other risk.” A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.

The twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) have financial strength ratings of A+ (the seventh highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).

Our Moody's ratings are A2 for Berkley Insurance Company, Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company (the sixth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).










The following sections describe our reporting segments and their operating units in greater detail. These operating units underwrite on behalf of one or more affiliated insurance companies within the group.  Certain operating units are identified by us herein for descriptive purposes only and are not legal entities.  Unless otherwise indicated, all references in this Form 10-K to “W. R. Berkley,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or similar terms refer to W. R. Berkley Corporation together with its subsidiaries and operating units.  W. R.

Insurance-Domestic

Certain of our Insurance -Domestic operating units underwrite specialty risks within the excess and surplus lines market and on an admitted basis. The risks are highly complex, often unique exposures that typically fall outside the underwriting guidelines of the standard insurance market or are best served by specialized knowledge of a particular industry.  The specialty lines of business include premises operations, commercial automobile, property, products liability and professional liability lines. The customers are highly diverse.  Each operating unit delivers their products through a variety of distribution channels, depending on the customer base and particular risks insured.

Other operating units provide insurance products and services that meet the specific needs of each regionally differentiated customer base by developing expertise in the niches that drive local communities.  They provide commercial insurance products to customers primarily in 45 states and the District of Columbia. Key clients of these units are small-to-mid-sized businesses and state and local governmental entities. Business is sold through a network of non-exclusive independent agents who are compensated on a commission basis.  These operating units are organized geographically in order to provide them with the flexibility to adapt quickly to local market conditions and customer needs.

Often, alternative methods of risk management result in our customers choosing to retain more risk than they might otherwise retain in the traditional insurance market.  To address this need, our operating units offer insurance products, analytical tools and risk management services such as loss control and claims management that enable clients to select their risk tolerance and manage it appropriately.  These units specialize in insuring, reinsuring and administering self-insurance programs and other alternative risk transfer mechanisms for clients such as commercial and governmental entity employers, employer groups, insurers, and other groups or entities seeking alternative ways to manage their exposure to risks. In addition to providing insurance products, the alternative markets units also provide a wide variety of fee-based services, including claims, administrative and consulting services.

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among others, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.

The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Although the loss reserves included in the Company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates, setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.










We discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience. For non-proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. At December 31, 2013, the discount rates by year ranged from2.1%to6.5%with a weighted average discount rate of4.1%. For proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware of2.2%. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, is$837 million,$867 millionand$892 millionatDecember 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations. These claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which were subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute pollution exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language.

Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were$36 millionand$34 millionatDecember 31, 2013and 2012, respectively.  The Company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were$59 millionand$56 millionatDecember 31, 2013and2012, respectively. Net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased by approximately$5 million,$2 millionand$1 millionin2013,2012and2011, respectively. Net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately $3 million, $2 million and $3 million in2013,2012and2011, respectively.  The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.


















































The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years:

A reconciliation between the reserves as ofDecember 31, 2013as reported in the accompanying consolidated GAAP financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) in the Company’s U.S. regulatory filings is as follows:

(1)   For statutory purposes, the Company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at2.2%as permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. In its GAAP financial statements, the Company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the risk-free rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate.












The following table presents the development of net reserves for 2003 through 2013. The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us. The upper portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years.

The “cumulative redundancy” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years. The impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above. It should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves, rather than accident or policy year loss development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years. For example, assume a claim that occurred in 2003 is reserved for $2,000 as of December 31, 2003. Assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2013 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in 2013, the $300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2003 through 2013.

For certain retrospectively rated insurance polices and reinsurance agreements, changes in loss and loss adjustment expenses for prior years are offset by additional or return premiums.  Such premiums are not reflected in the above table.

Reinsurance

We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better with at least $500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A- (Excellent)” or better with at least $250 million in policyholder surplus.



Regulation



U.S. Regulation

Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business.

Overview.  Our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums, loss expenses and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation.










Holding Company Statutes. In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase.

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) adopted amendments to the model holding company law in 2010, expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems.  The amendments include increased group-level reporting requirements, submission of an annual enterprise risk report by a regulated insurance company's ultimate controlling person and increased information made accessible to regulators regarding an insurer's non-insurer's affiliates.

These NAIC amendments must be adopted by the individual state legislatures and insurance regulators in order to be effective. To date, 24 states have adopted the amendments, and in order to maintain compliance with NAIC standards, the remaining states must adopt them in whole or substantial part by January 2016.

Additionally, the NAIC recently adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (the “ORSA Model Act”). The ORSA Model Act will require an insurance holding company system’s chief risk officer to submit annually to its lead state insurance regulator an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Summary Report (“ORSA”). The ORSA is a confidential internal assessment of the material and relevant risks associated with an insurer’s current business plan and the sufficiency of capital resources to support those risks.

The ORSA Model Act must be adopted by the individual state legislature and insurance regulators in order to be effective. It is expected that the ORSA Model Act’s requirements generally will become effective in the states on January 1, 2015.

We cannot predict the impact, if any, that these amendments and compliance with the ORSA Model Act will have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.

Risk Based Capital Requirements. The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The NAIC RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any RBC action level as of December 31, 2013.

Insurance Regulatory Information System.   The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios.

Guaranty Funds.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded under a state's guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums. The NAIC Model Post-Assessment Guaranty Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits assessments to an insurer to 2% of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business.

Additionally, state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability “shared market,” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “FAIR” plans. In addition, some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state.

Excess and Surplus Lines. The regulation of our U.S. subsidiaries' excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future.










Dividends.  We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled.  See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

Trade Practices.  State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.

Investment Regulation.Investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments.  In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications.

The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.

Federal Regulation.Although the federal government and its regulatory agencies generally do not directly regulate the business of insurance, federal initiatives could have an impact on our business in a variety of ways.   In July 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), which effected sweeping changes to financial services regulation in the United States.  The Dodd-Frank Act created two new federal government bodies, the Federal Insurance Office (the “FIO”) and the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”), which may impact the regulation of insurance.  Although the FIO has preemption authority over state insurance laws that conflict with certain international agreements, it does not have general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance.  The FIO has authority to represent the United States in international insurance matters and is authorized to monitor the U.S. insurance industry and identify potential regulatory gaps that could contribute to systemic risk.

On December 12, 2013, the FIO delivered a report to Congress on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the U.S. The report recommended that, in the short term, the U.S. system of insurance regulation can be modernized through state-based improvements combined with certain federal actions. The report identified areas for direct federal involvement in international standard setting, the FIO participation in supervisory colleges which monitor the regulation of large national and internationally active insurance groups and federal pursuit of international covered agreements to afford nationally uniform treatment of reinsurance collateral requirements. The report also made several recommendations for state reform of insurance regulation including changes to the state regulation of insurance company solvency, group supervision and corporate governance. The FIO report stated that the system of U.S. insurance regulation can be modernized and improved in the short-term, while warning that if the states do not act in the near term to effectively regulate matters on a consistent and cooperative basis, in the FIO’s view there will be a greater role for federal regulation of insurance.

The FIO also can recommend to the FSOC that it designate an insurer as an entity posing risks to the United States financial stability in the event of the insurer's material financial distress or failure.  An insurer so designated by FSOC could be subject to Federal Reserve supervision and heightened prudential standards.  Based upon our current business model and balance sheet, we do not believe that we will be designated by the FSOC as such an institution.  Although the potential impacts of the Dodd-Frank Act on the U. S. insurance industry is not clear, our business could be affected by changes to the U.S. system of insurance regulation or our designation or the designation of insurers or reinsurers with which we do business as systemically significant non-bank financial companies.

In April 2013, a federal savings association that was indirectly owned by the Company sold substantially all of its assets, and the Company deregistered as a savings and loan holding company.










International Regulation

In the European Union, a new insurance regulatory regime governing, among other things, capital adequacy and risk management called “Solvency II” is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2016.  In anticipation of the implementation of Solvency II, Lloyd’s applies a  capital adequacy test to all Lloyd’s syndicates, including our syndicate, that is based on Solvency II principles.  Solvency II provides for the supervision of group solvency. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II.  While it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us, we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our U.S. and international companies will be materially impacted.

Our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in Scandinavia, Continental Europe, South America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Canada.  Generally, our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations.

Competition

The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive, with many insurance companies of various sizes, as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs, transacting business in the United States and internationally. We compete directly with a large number of these companies.  Competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer.  Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions.  Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit.  As a result of increased competition, from 2005 to 2010 we generally experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions.  Although insurance rates increased commencing in 2011, certain products continued to experience strong competition.

Competition for Insurance-Domestic business comes from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers.  Our specialty operating units compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers.  Other regional units compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers.  Additionally, direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our regional units by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company.

Our Insurance-International operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small, which in some cases are related to government entities, as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies.

Competition for the Reinsurance-Global business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market.  These competitors include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic Reinsurance, Partner Re and others.

In recent years, various institutional investors have increasingly sought to participate in the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries. Well-capitalized new entrants to the property and casualty insurance and reinsurance industries, or










existing competitors that receive substantial infusions of capital, provide increasing competition, which may adversely impact our business and profitability. Further, an expanded supply of reinsurance capital may lower costs for insurers that rely on reinsurance and, as a consequence, those insurers may be able to price their products more competitively.

Additionally, competition from insurers and reinsurers based in Bermuda and other tax-advantaged jurisdictions continues to increase, including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign-based entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses.

Employees

Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries.

We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues.
