W. R. Berkley Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is an
    insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial
    lines writers in the United States and operates in five segments
    of the property casualty insurance business:



•Specialty lines of insurance, including excess and surplus
    lines, premises operations, professional liability and
    commercial automobile;•Regional commercial property casualty insurance;•Alternative markets, including workers’ compensation and
    the management of self-insurance programs;•Reinsurance, including treaty, facultative and Lloyd’s
    business; and•International.



Our decentralized structure provides us with the flexibility to

    customers in order to better understand their individual needs
    and risk characteristics. Our structure allows us to capitalize
    on the benefits of economies of scale through centralized
    capital, investment and reinsurance management, and actuarial,
    financial and corporate legal staff support. Nineteen of the
    operating units described below were formed since 2006 to
    capitalize on various business opportunities.

The following sections describe our insurance segments and their
    operating units. These operating units underwrite on behalf of
    one or more affiliated insurance companies within the group
    pursuant to underwriting management agreements. Certain
    operating units are identified by us for descriptive purposes
    only and are not legal entities.



Twenty-five of our twenty-six insurance company subsidiaries
    rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc.
    (“A.M. Best”) have ratings of A+ (Superior) (the
    second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings), and one is
    rated A (Excellent) (the third highest rating).
    A.M. Best’s ratings are based upon factors of concern
    to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not
    directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best
    states: “The Financial Strength Rating opinion addresses
    the relative ability of an insurer to meet its ongoing insurance
    obligations. The ratings are not assigned to specific insurance
    policies or contracts and do not address any other risk.”
    A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its
    ratings of the Company’s subsidiaries are therefore subject
    to change.



Twenty-two of our twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries
    rated by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”)
    have financial strength ratings of A+ (the seventh highest
    rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings), and one is rated A
    (the eighth highest rating).

    Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company
    (the sixth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).

Loss
    and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves



To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or
    unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet
    account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay
    claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which
    have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves
    for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective
    judgments, often including the interplay of specific
    uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial
    measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as
    significant





periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured
    loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate
    determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s
    payment of that loss.



In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish
    a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the
    ultimate payment. The estimate represents an informed judgment
    based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience
    and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and
    value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also
    established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred
    but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential
    inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of
    settling claims, including legal and other fees and general
    expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process.
    Reserves are established based upon the then current legal
    interpretation of coverage provided.



In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in
    addition to the economic value of losses. These factors include
    historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes
    and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The
    actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past
    experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current
    developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for
    predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily
    based on management’s informed estimates and judgments
    using currently available data. As additional experience and
    other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates
    and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve
    increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in
    periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.



The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater
    when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially
    difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves
    given the current economic environment and related government
    actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower
    inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would
    generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions
    regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or
    decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in
    which such assumptions are changed.





We discount our liabilities for excess workers’
    compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion
    of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time
    over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to
    appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on
    investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected
    losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting
    was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience. For
    non-proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses
    have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined
    by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. These
    discount rates range from 2.5% to 6.5% with a weighted average
    discount rate of 4.4%. For proportional business, reserves for
    losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory
    rate permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of
    Delaware of 2.5%. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting
    the effects of ceded reinsurance, is $898,193,000, $877,305,000
    and $846,748,000 at December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. The increase in the aggregate discount from 2009
    to 2010 and from 2008 to 2009 resulted from the increase in
    workers’ compensation gross reserves.



To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our
    insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on
    our operations. These claims have not materially impacted us
    because these subsidiaries





generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which
    are subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures.



Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses
    relating to asbestos and environmental claims were $35,543,000
    and $36,525,000 at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. The Company’s gross reserves for losses and
    loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental
    claims were $51,214,000 and $53,986,000 at December 31,
    2010 and 2009, respectively. Net incurred losses and loss
    expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims
    increased (decreased) by approximately $1,755,000, $(614,000)
    and $440,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Net paid
    losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental
    claims were approximately $2,737,000, $2,508,000 and $2,384,000
    in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The estimation of these
    liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal
    variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a
    reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the
    absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these
    exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved
    legal matters, including coverage issues as well as the cost of
    litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of
    ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to
    financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.



The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of
    year and end of year property casualty reserves for the
    indicated years (amounts in thousands):

(a)The net provision for loss and loss expenses does not include
    policyholder benefits incurred on life insurance of $47,000 in
    2008.(b)Claims occurring during the current year are net of discounts of
    $67,763,000, $80,455,000 and $97,698,000 in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.(c)The decrease in estimates for claims occurring in prior years is
    net of discounts. On an undiscounted basis, the estimates for
    claims occurring in prior years decreased by $246,941,000 in
    2010, $232,040,000 in 2009, and $180,154,000 in 2008.(d)Approximately $19 million and $44 million of the
    favorable reserve development in 2010 and 2009, respectively,
    was fully offset by a reduction in earned premiums. The
    favorable reserve development, net of premium offsets, was
    $234 million in 2010 and $190 million in 2009.



Also, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”
    for further information regarding the decrease in estimates for
    claims occurring in prior years.





A reconciliation between the reserves as of December 31,
    2010 as reported in the accompanying consolidated GAAP financial
    statements and those reported on the basis of statutory
    accounting principles (“SAP”) in the Company’s
    U.S. regulatory filings is as follows (amounts in
    thousands):



Net reserves reported in U.S. regulatory filings on a SAP basis$7,893,933Reserves fornon-U.S.companies371,165Loss reserve discounting(1)(264,334)Ceded reserves1,017,028Other(1,243)Gross reserves reported in the consolidated U.S. GAAP financial
    statements$9,016,549









(1)For statutory purposes, the Company discounts its workers’
    compensation reinsurance reserves at 2.5% as permitted by the
    Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. In its GAAP
    financial statements, the Company discounts excess workers’
    compensation reserves at the risk-free rate and assumed
    workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate.



The following table presents the development of net reserves for
    2000 through 2010. The top line of the table shows the estimated
    reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the
    balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This
    represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for
    claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance
    sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not
    reported to us. The upper portion of the table shows the
    re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on
    experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate
    changes as more information becomes known about the frequency
    and severity of claims for individual years.



The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents
    the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years. For
    example, the 2000 reserves have developed a $1,120 million
    deficiency over ten years. That amount has been reflected in
    income over the ten years. The impact on the results of
    operations of the past three years of changes in reserve
    estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above. It should
    be noted that the table presents a “run off” of
    balance sheet reserves, rather than accident or policy year loss
    development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the
    effects of changes in reserves for all prior years. For example,
    assume a claim that occurred in 2000 is reserved for $2,000 as
    of December 31, 2000. Assuming this claim estimate was
    changed in 2010 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in 2010,
    the $300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year
    from 2000 through 2010.

Reinsurance



We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of
    our exposures and paying to reinsurers a part of the premiums
    received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased
    principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to
    protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does
    not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for
    the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming
    reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of
    the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of
    our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with
    substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally
    the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an
    A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better
    with at least $500 million in policyholder surplus and the
    reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an
    A.M. Best rating of “A-(Excellent)” or better
    with at least $250 million in policyholder surplus.





Regulation



U.S.
    Regulation



Our insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of
    regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do
    business, and the Company believes that it is in compliance in
    all material respects with such regulations. Our insurance
    subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory,
    supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance
    commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the
    standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the
    licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and
    limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the
    benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and
    premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance
    companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the
    financial condition of insurers or for other purposes;
    establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums
    and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters.
    Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than excess and
    surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all
    rates with the insurance department of each state in which they
    operate. Our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries
    generally operate free of rate and form regulation.



In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance
    subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing
    insurance holding company systems. Typically, such statutes
    require that we periodically file information with the
    appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information
    concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition
    and general business operations. Under the terms of applicable
    state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more
    than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding
    voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory
    approval of the purchase. Under Alabama law, which is applicable
    to us due to our ownership of American Mining Insurance Company,
    Inc., an Alabama domiciled insurance company, the acquisition of
    more than 5% of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory
    approval. Further, state insurance statutes typically place
    limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions
    payable by insurance companies in order to protect their
    solvency. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and
    Capital Resources.”



The National Association of Insurance Commissioners
    (“NAIC”) utilizes a Risk Based Capital
    (“RBC”) formula that is designed to measure the
    adequacy of an insurer’s statutory surplus in relation to
    the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a
    risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by
    applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve
    items. The RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of
    regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the
    calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in
    severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for
    corrective action to actually placing the insurer under
    regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance
    subsidiaries was above the authorized RBC control level as of
    December 31, 2010.



The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios
    referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System
    (“IRIS”). On the basis of statutory financial
    statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC
    annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance
    regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance
    companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each
    of the IRIS financial ratios.



The NAIC also has recently adopted amendments to the model
    holding company law, expanding upon the regulation of holding
    company systems. When and if adopted by the various states,
    these laws and regulations may have additional impact upon the
    Company’s operations.



Our insurance company subsidiaries are also subject to
    assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a
    particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent
    and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company
    to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded
    under a state’s guaranty fund to policyholders of the
    insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all
    licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members
    of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share
    of direct written premiums. The NAIC Model Post-Assessment
    Guaranty Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits
    assessments to an insurer to 2% of its subject premium and
    permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting.
    Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which
    our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have
    limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain
    lines of business.





State insurance laws and regulations require us to participate
    in mandatory property-liability “shared market,”
    “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain
    types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who
    otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided
    by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned
    risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or
    “FAIR” plans. In addition, some states require
    insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that
    exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory
    shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the
    amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written
    by the specific arrangement in the applicable state.



The regulation of our U.S. subsidiaries’ excess and
    surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the
    regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines
    subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and
    reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are
    eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although the surplus
    lines business is generally less regulated than admitted
    business, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements
    in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines
    insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state
    measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus
    lines insurance in the future.



We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the
    form of dividends and management fees for certain management
    services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts
    prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the
    approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an
    insurance subsidiary is domiciled.



State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions
    governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of
    insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales
    practices, policyholder services, claims management and
    complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally
    enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct
    examinations.





Competition



The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are
    highly competitive, with over 2,000 insurance companies
    transacting business in the United States. We compete directly
    with a large number of these companies. Our strategy in this
    highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or
    geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a
    competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market
    conditions. Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing
    practices. Such practices are based upon a Company-wide
    philosophy to price products with the intent of making an
    underwriting profit. Competition in our industry generally
    changes with profitability and has increased since 2004. As a
    result of increased competition, we have experienced both
    downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as
    well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and
    conditions.





Competition for specialty and alternative markets business comes
    from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national
    multi-line companies and reinsurers. Standard carriers have
    increasingly competed for excess and surplus business, and as a
    result many of our specialty companies have reduced their
    writing substantially.



Competition for the reinsurance business comes from domestic and
    foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a
    direct basis or through the broker market. These competitors
    include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic
    Reinsurance, and Partner Re. Additionally, our reinsurance
    writings have reduced substantially since many ceding companies
    have elected to retain more business and the limited business
    available has become more competitive.



The regional property casualty subsidiaries compete with mutual
    and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers.
    Direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with the
    regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their
    salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than
    through independent agents such as those used by the Company.



The international operations compete with native insurance
    operations both large and small, which may be related to
    government entities, as well as with branches or local
    subsidiaries of multinational companies.



Competition from insurers and reinsurers based in Bermuda and
    other tax advantaged jurisdictions has increased over the last
    several years, including from domestic based subsidiaries of
    foreign based entities especially as to excess and surplus lines
    business.



Employees



As of February 16, 2011, we employed 6,253 individuals. Of
    this number, our subsidiaries employed 6,154 persons and
    the remaining 99 persons were employed at the parent
    company.



Other
    Information about the Company’s Business



We maintain an interest in the acquisition and start up of
    complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible
    acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition,
    our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of
    business to meet the needs of insureds.



Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity
    and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and
    reinsurance subsidiaries. Although the effect on our business of
    catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms,
    earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance,
    they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results
    of any one or more reporting periods.



We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more
    of our consolidated revenues.



Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal,
    state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted
    regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or
    otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had
    a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or
    competitive position.
