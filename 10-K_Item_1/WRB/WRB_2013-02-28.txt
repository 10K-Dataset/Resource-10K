ITEM  1.  BUSINESS



W. R. Berkley Corporation is an insurance holding company that is among the largest commercial lines writers in the United States.  It operates in the following segments of the property casualty insurance business:



•Specialty,including excess and surplus lines and admitted specialty lines;

•Regionalcommercial lines property casualty;

•Reinsurance,on both a facultative and treaty basis and participating in business written through Lloyd's of London; and

•Internationalbusiness in selected regions throughout the world.



Each of our five business segments is composed of individual operating units that serve a market defined by geography, products, services or types of customers. Each of our operating units is positioned close to its customer base and participates in a niche market requiring specialized knowledge about a territory or product.  This strategy of decentralized operations allows each of our units to identify and respond quickly and effectively to changing market conditions and local customer needs, while capitalizing on the benefits of centralized capital, investment and reinsurance management, and corporate actuarial, financial, enterprise risk management and legal staff support.



Our business approach is focused on meeting the needs of our customers, maintaining a high quality balance sheet, and allocating capital to our best opportunities.  New businesses are started when opportunities are identified and when the right talent and expertise are found to lead a business.  Of our 48 operating units, 41 have been organized and developed internally and seven have been added through acquisition.  Of these units, 23 have been formed since 2006.



Our Specialty insurance and Reinsurance operations are conducted throughout the United States, and, on a limited basis, outside the United States. Regional insurance operations are conducted across the continental United States in six regions: the Midwest, Northeast, Southwestern, Southeastern (excluding Florida and Louisiana), Mid Atlantic, and North Pacific regions.  Alternative Markets operations are conducted throughout the United States.  Our International operations are conducted primarily in the United Kingdom, Continental Europe, South America, Australia, the Asia Pacific region, Scandinavia and Canada.

Twenty-six of our twenty-seven insurance company subsidiaries rated by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) have ratings of A+ (Superior) (the second highest rating out of 15 possible ratings), and one is rated A (Excellent) (the third highest rating). A.M. Best's ratings are based upon factors of concern to policyholders, insurance agents and brokers and are not directed toward the protection of investors. A.M. Best states: “The Financial Strength Rating opinion addresses the relative ability of an insurer to meet its ongoing insurance obligations. The ratings are not assigned to specific insurance policies or contracts and do not address any other risk.” A.M. Best reviews its ratings on a periodic basis, and its ratings of the Company's subsidiaries are therefore subject to change.



The twenty-three insurance company subsidiaries rated by Standard & Poor's (“S&P”) have financial strength ratings of A+ (the seventh highest rating out of twenty-seven possible ratings).



Our Moody's ratings are A2 for Berkley Insurance Company, Berkley Regional Insurance Company and Admiral Insurance Company (the sixth highest rating out of twenty-one possible ratings).

The table below represents  summary underwriting ratios on a GAAP basis for our segments.  Loss ratio is losses and loss expenses incurred expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned.  Expense ratio is underwriting expenses expressed as a percentage of net premiums earned.  Underwriting expenses do not include expenses related to insurance services or unallocated corporate expenses.  Combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.  The combined ratio represents a measure of underwriting profitability, excluding investment income. A number in excess of 100 indicates an underwriting loss; a number below 100 indicates an underwriting profit:

Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves

To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses, either known or unknown, insurers establish reserves, which is a balance sheet account representing estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events which have occurred. Estimates and assumptions relating to reserves for losses and loss expenses are based on complex and subjective judgments, often including the interplay of specific uncertainties with related accounting and actuarial measurements. Such estimates are also susceptible to change as significant periods of time may elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss, the report of the loss to the insurer, the ultimate determination of the cost of the loss and the insurer’s payment of that loss.

In general, when a claim is reported, claims personnel establish a “case reserve” for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment based upon known information about the claim at that time. The estimate represents an informed judgment based on general reserving practices and reflects the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel regarding the nature and value of the specific type of claim. Reserves are also established on an aggregate basis to provide for losses incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) to the insurer, potential inadequacy of case reserves and the estimated expenses of settling claims, including legal and other fees and general expenses of administrating the claims adjustment process. Reserves are established based upon the then current legal interpretation of coverage provided.

In examining reserve adequacy, several factors are considered in estimating the ultimate economic value of losses. These factors include, among others, historical data, legal developments, changes in social attitudes and economic conditions, including the effects of inflation. The actuarial process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted judgmentally for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. Reserve amounts are necessarily based on management’s informed estimates and judgments using currently available data. As additional experience and other data become available and are reviewed, these estimates and judgments may be revised. This may result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our results in periods in which such estimates and assumptions are changed.

The risk and complexity of estimating loss reserves are greater when economic conditions are uncertain. It is especially difficult to estimate the impact of inflation on loss reserves given the current economic environment and related government actions. Whereas a slowing economy would generally lead to lower inflation or even deflation, increased government spending would generally lead to higher inflation. A change in our assumptions regarding inflation would result in reserve increases or decreases that would be reflected in our earnings in periods in which such assumptions are changed.

Reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability. Rather, reserves represent an estimate of what management expects the ultimate settlement and claim administration will cost. While the methods for establishing the reserves are well tested over time, some of the major assumptions about anticipated loss emergence patterns are subject to unanticipated fluctuation. These estimates, which generally involve actuarial projections, are based on management’s assessment of facts and circumstances then known, as well as estimates of trends in claims severity and frequency, judicial theories of liability and other factors, including the actions of third parties, which are beyond the Company’s control. These variables are affected by external and internal events, such as inflation and economic volatility, judicial and litigation trends, reinsurance coverage, legislative changes and claim handling and reserving practices, which make it more difficult to accurately predict claim costs. The inherent uncertainties of estimating reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities where long periods of time elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made. Although the loss reserves included in the Company’s financial statements represent management’s best estimates, setting reserves is inherently uncertain and the Company cannot provide assurance that its current reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent events.

We discount our liabilities for excess workers’ compensation business and the workers’ compensation portion of our reinsurance business because of the long period of time over which losses are paid. Discounting is intended to appropriately match losses and loss expenses to income earned on investment securities supporting the liabilities. The expected losses and loss expense payout pattern subject to discounting was derived from the Company’s loss payout experience. For non-proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted using risk-free discount rates determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve. At December 31, 2012, the discount rates by year ranged from2.1%to6.5%with a weighted average discount rate of4.2%. For proportional business, reserves for losses and loss expenses have been discounted at the statutory rate permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware of2.2%. The aggregate net discount, after reflecting the effects of ceded reinsurance, is$867 million,$892 millionand$898 millionatDecember 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

To date, known asbestos and environmental claims at our insurance company subsidiaries have not had a material impact on our operations. These claims have not materially impacted us because these subsidiaries generally did not insure the larger industrial companies which were subject to significant asbestos or environmental exposures prior to 1986 when an absolute pollution exclusion was incorporated into standard policy language.

Our net reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos and environmental claims were$34 millionat bothDecember 31, 2012and 2011. The Company’s gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses relating to asbestos










and environmental claims were$56 millionand$59 millionatDecember 31, 2012and2011, respectively. Net incurred losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims increased by approximately$2 million,$1 millionand$2 millionin2012,2011and2010, respectively. Net paid losses and loss expenses for reported asbestos and environmental claims were approximately$2 million, $3 million and $2 millionin2012,2011and2010, respectively.  The estimation of these liabilities is subject to significantly greater than normal variation and uncertainty because it is difficult to make a reasonable actuarial estimate of these liabilities due to the absence of a generally accepted actuarial methodology for these exposures and the potential effect of significant unresolved legal matters, including coverage issues as well as the cost of litigating the legal issues. Additionally, the determination of ultimate damages and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties are highly uncertain.

The table below provides a reconciliation of the beginning of year and end of year property casualty reserves for the indicated years:

A reconciliation between the reserves as ofDecember 31, 2012as reported in the accompanying consolidated GAAP financial statements and those reported on the basis of statutory accounting principles (“SAP”) in the Company’s U.S. regulatory filings is as follows:

(1)   For statutory purposes, the Company discounts its workers’ compensation reinsurance reserves at2.2%as permitted by the Department of Insurance of the State of Delaware. In its GAAP financial statements, the










Company discounts excess workers’ compensation reserves at the risk-free rate and assumed workers’ compensation reserves at the statutory rate.

The following table presents the development of net reserves for 2002 through 2012. The top line of the table shows the estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss expenses recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years. This represents the estimated amount of losses and loss expenses for claims arising in all prior years that are unpaid at the balance sheet date, including losses that had been incurred but not reported to us. The upper portion of the table shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded reserves based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The estimate changes as more information becomes known about the frequency and severity of claims for individual years.

The “cumulative redundancy (deficiency)” represents the aggregate change in the estimates over all prior years. The impact on the results of operations of the past three years of changes in reserve estimates is shown in the reconciliation tables above. It should be noted that the table presents a “run off” of balance sheet reserves, rather than accident or policy year loss development. Therefore, each amount in the table includes the effects of changes in reserves for all prior years. For example, assume a claim that occurred in 2002 is reserved for $2,000 as of December 31, 2002. Assuming this claim estimate was changed in 2012 to $2,300, and was settled for $2,300 in 2012, the $300 deficiency would appear as a deficiency in each year from 2002 through 2011.

Reinsurance

We follow a common industry practice of reinsuring a portion of our exposures and paying to reinsurers a portion of the premiums received on the policies that we write. Reinsurance is purchased principally to reduce net liability on individual risks and to protect against catastrophic losses. Although reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, it does make the assuming reinsurer contractually liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance coverage. We monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and attempt to place our coverages only with substantial, financially sound carriers. As a result, generally the reinsurers who reinsure our casualty insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A (Excellent)” or better with at least $500 million in policyholder surplus and the reinsurers who cover our property insurance must have an A.M. Best rating of “A- (Excellent)” or better with at least $250 million in policyholder surplus.



Regulation



U.S. Regulation



Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are subject to varying degrees of regulation and supervision in the jurisdictions in which they do business.



Overview.  Our domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutes which delegate regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance commissioners. This regulation relates to such matters as the standards of solvency which must be met and maintained; the licensing of insurers and their agents; the nature of and limitations on investments; deposits of securities for the benefit of policyholders; approval of certain policy forms and premium rates; periodic examination of the affairs of insurance companies; annual and other reports required to be filed on the financial condition of insurers or for other purposes; establishment and maintenance of reserves for unearned premiums, loss expenses and losses; and requirements regarding numerous other matters. Our property casualty subsidiaries, other than excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries, must generally file all rates with the insurance department of each state in which they operate. Our excess and surplus and reinsurance subsidiaries generally operate free of rate and form regulation.



Holding Company Statutes. In addition to regulatory supervision of our insurance subsidiaries, we are subject to state statutes governing insurance holding company systems. Typically, such statutes require that we periodically file










information with the appropriate state insurance commissioner, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations. Under the terms of applicable state statutes, any person or entity desiring to purchase more than a specified percentage (commonly 10%) of our outstanding voting securities would be required to obtain prior regulatory approval of the purchase. Under Alabama law, which is applicable to us due to our ownership of American Mining Insurance Company, Inc., an Alabama domiciled insurance company, the acquisition of more than 5% of our capital stock is subject to prior regulatory approval.



The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) adopted amendments to the model holding company law in 2010, expanding upon the regulation of holding company systems.  The amendments include increased group-level reporting requirements, submission of an annual enterprise risk report by a regulated insurance company's ultimate controlling person and increased information made accessible to regulators regarding an insurer's non-insurer's affiliates.



Risk Based Capital Requirements. The NAIC utilizes a Risk Based Capital (“RBC”) formula that is designed to measure the adequacy of an insurer's statutory surplus in relation to the risks inherent in its business. The RBC formula develops a risk adjusted target level of adjusted statutory capital by applying certain factors to various asset, premium and reserve items. The NAIC RBC Model Law provides for four incremental levels of regulatory attention for insurers whose surplus is below the calculated RBC target. These levels of attention range in severity from requiring the insurer to submit a plan for corrective action to actually placing the insurer under regulatory control. The RBC of each of our domestic insurance subsidiaries was above any RBC action level as of December 31, 2012.



Insurance Regulatory Information System.   The NAIC also has developed a set of 13 financial ratios referred to as the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”). On the basis of statutory financial statements filed with state insurance regulators, the NAIC annually calculates these IRIS ratios to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies. The NAIC has established an acceptable range for each of the IRIS financial ratios.



Guaranty Funds.  Our U.S. insurance subsidiaries are also subject to assessment by state guaranty funds when an insurer in a particular jurisdiction has been judicially declared insolvent and insufficient funds are available from the liquidated company to pay policyholders and claimants. The protection afforded under a state's guaranty fund to policyholders of the insolvent insurer varies from state to state. Generally, all licensed property casualty insurers are considered to be members of the fund, and assessments are based upon their pro rata share of direct written premiums. The NAIC Model Post-Assessment Guaranty Fund Act, which many states have adopted, limits assessments to an insurer to 2% of its subject premium and permits recoupment of assessments through rate setting. Likewise, several states (or underwriting organizations of which our insurance subsidiaries are required to be members) have limited assessment authority with regard to deficits in certain lines of business.



Additionally, state insurance laws and regulations require us to participate in mandatory property-liability “shared market,” “pooling” or similar arrangements that provide certain types of insurance coverage to individuals or others who otherwise are unable to purchase coverage voluntarily provided by private insurers. Shared market mechanisms include assigned risk plans and fair access to insurance requirement or “FAIR” plans. In addition, some states require insurers to participate in reinsurance pools for claims that exceed specified amounts. Our participation in these mandatory shared market or pooling mechanisms generally is related to the amount of our direct writings for the type of coverage written by the specific arrangement in the applicable state.



Excess and Surplus Lines. The regulation of our U.S. subsidiaries' excess and surplus lines insurance business differs significantly from the regulation of our admitted business. Our surplus lines subsidiaries are subject to the surplus lines regulation and reporting requirements of the jurisdictions in which they are eligible to write surplus lines insurance. Although the surplus lines business is generally less regulated than admitted business, strict regulations apply to surplus lines placements in the laws of every state and the regulation of surplus lines insurance may undergo changes in the future. Federal or state measures may be introduced to increase the oversight of surplus lines insurance in the future.



Dividends.  We receive funds from our insurance company subsidiaries in the form of dividends and management fees for certain management services. Annual dividends in excess of maximum amounts prescribed by state statutes may not be paid without the approval of the insurance commissioner of the state in which an insurance subsidiary is domiciled.  See “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources.”












Trade Practices.  State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing trade practices and the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing marketing and sales practices, policyholder services, claims management and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.



Investment Regulation.Investments by our domestic insurance companies must comply with applicable laws and regulations which prescribe the kind, quality and concentration of investments.  In general, these laws and regulations permit investments in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and certain other investments, subject to specified limits and certain other qualifications.



The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act.





Federal Regulation.



In addition, as a result of its direct and indirect majority ownership interest in Peyton Street Independent Financial Services Corporation, a thrift holding company ("Peyton Street"), and indirect majority ownership stake in InsurBanc, a federal savings bank ("InsurBanc"), W. R. Berkley Corporation is a "savings and loan holding company" and, under the Dodd-Frank Act, is subject to the oversight of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve").  InsurBanc has entered into a definitive agreement to sell its assets and deposit liabilities, following which both Peyton Street and InsurBanc would proceed to liquidate and each of Peyton Street and W. R. Berkley Corporation would deregister as a savings and loan holding company.  The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.  As a savings and loan holding company, W. R. Berkley Corporation may be subject to certain prior notification requirements, restrictions on dividends, stock repurchases and distributions, transactions with affiliates and compensation plans and additional requirements related to its shareholders, management reporting and  capital adequacy if the de-banking were not to occur as anticipated or until it takes such other actions to terminate W. R. Berkley Corporation's status as a savings and loan holding company.












International Regulation

Our insurance subsidiaries based in the United Kingdom are regulated by the Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”).  The FSA oversees compliance with established periodic auditing and reporting requirements, risk assessment reviews, minimum solvency margins and individual capital assessment requirements, dividend restrictions, restrictions governing the appointment of key officers, restrictions governing controlling ownership interests and various other requirements. Our Lloyd's syndicate and managing agency are also regulated by the FSA and Lloyd's.  Through Lloyd's, we are licensed to write business in various countries throughout the world by virtue of Lloyd's international licenses.  In each such country, we are subject to the laws and insurance regulation of that country.  Additionally, FSA regulations also impact us as “controller” (an FSA defined term) of our U.K.-regulated subsidiaries, whereby we are required to notify the FSA about significant events relating to their controllers (i.e. persons or entities which have certain levels of influence over the regulated entities) as well as changes of control, and to submit an annual report regarding their controllers.  Through the FSA's Approved Persons regime, certain employees and directors are subject to regulation by the FSA as to their fitness.  In addition, certain employees are individually registered at Lloyd's.

The European Union's executive body, the European Commission, is implementing new capital adequacy and risk management regulations called “Solvency II” that already applies to our Lloyd's Syndicate and would apply to our businesses across the European Union beginning on January 1, 2014.  Solvency II provides for the supervision of group solvency. Under Solvency II, it is possible that the U.S. parent of a European Union subsidiary could be subject to certain Solvency II requirements if the regulator determines that the subsidiary's capital position is dependent on the parent company and the U.S. company is not already subject to regulations deemed “equivalent” to Solvency II.  While it is not certain how or if these actions will impact us, we do not currently expect the capital management strategies for our U.S. and international companies will be materially impacted.

Our international underwriting subsidiaries are also subject to varying degrees of regulation in certain countries in Scandinavia, Continental Europe, South America, Australia, Southeast Asia and Canada.  Generally, our subsidiaries must satisfy local regulatory requirements. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extent of the requirements differ substantially. Key areas where country regulations may differ include: (i) the type of financial reports to be filed; (ii) a requirement to use local intermediaries; (iii) the amount of reinsurance permissible; (iv) the scope of any regulation of policy forms and rates; and (v) the type and frequency of regulatory examinations.



Competition



The property casualty insurance and reinsurance businesses are highly competitive, with many insurance companies of various sizes, as well as other entities offering risk alternatives such as self-insured retentions or captive programs, transacting business in the United States and internationally. We compete directly with a large number of these companies.  Competition in our industry is largely measured by the ability to provide insurance and services at a price and on terms that are reasonable and acceptable to the customer.  Our strategy in this highly fragmented industry is to seek specialized areas or geographic regions where our insurance subsidiaries can gain a competitive advantage by responding quickly to changing market conditions.  Our subsidiaries establish their own pricing practices based upon a Company-wide philosophy to price products with the intent of making an underwriting profit.  As a result of increased competition, from 2005 to 2010 we generally experienced both downward pressure on pricing for many of our insurance lines as well as demands by insureds and cedants for better terms and conditions.  Although insurance rates increased commencing in 2011, certain products continued to experience strong competition.



Competition for Specialty and Alternative Markets business comes from other specialty insurers, regional carriers, large national multi-line companies and reinsurers.  Our Specialty companies compete with excess and surplus insurers as well as standard carriers.



Competition for the Reinsurance business comes from domestic and foreign reinsurers, which produce their business either on a direct basis or through the broker market.  These competitors include Swiss Re, Munich Re, Berkshire Hathaway, Transatlantic Reinsurance, Partner Re and others.



Our Regional subsidiaries compete with mutual and other regional stock companies as well as national carriers.  Additionally, direct writers of property casualty insurance compete with our Regional subsidiaries by writing insurance through their salaried employees, generally at a lower acquisition cost than through independent agents such as those used by the Company.












Our International operations compete with native insurance operations both large and small, which in some cases are related to government entities, as well as with branches or local subsidiaries of multinational companies.



Additionally, competition from insurers and reinsurers based in Bermuda and other tax advantaged jurisdictions continues to increase, including from domestic based subsidiaries of foreign based entities in the excess and surplus lines businesses.



Employees



As of February 14, 2013, we employed 7,412 individuals. Of this number, our subsidiaries employed 7,298 persons and the remaining 114 persons were employed at the parent company.



Other Information about the Company's Business



We maintain an interest in the acquisition and startup of complementary businesses and continue to evaluate possible acquisitions and new ventures on an ongoing basis. In addition, our insurance subsidiaries develop new coverages or lines of business to meet the needs of insureds.



Seasonal weather variations and other events affect the severity and frequency of losses sustained by the insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries. Although the effect on our business of catastrophes such as tornadoes, hurricanes, hailstorms, earthquakes and terrorist acts may be mitigated by reinsurance, they nevertheless can have a significant impact on the results of any one or more reporting periods.



We have no customer which accounts for 10 percent or more of our consolidated revenues.



Compliance by W. R. Berkley and its subsidiaries with federal, state and local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment, has not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
