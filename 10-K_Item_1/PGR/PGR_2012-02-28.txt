ITEM 1.BUSINESS

(a) General Development of
Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an insurance holding company formed
in 1965, currently has 54 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance company affiliate. These insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services.
Our property-casualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles, uninsured and underinsured bodily injury, and liability to others for personal injury or property damage
arising out of the use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations. We operate our businesses throughout the United States and sell personal auto insurance on an Internet-only basis in
Australia.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated by reference fromNote 10 - Segment Informationin our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial
property-casualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $15.1 billion in 2011, compared to $14.5 billion in 2010 and $14.0 billion in 2009. Our combined ratio, calculated on a basis consistent with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was 93.0 in 2011, 92.4 in 2010, and 91.6 in 2009.

Organization

Auto insurance
differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because, among other factors, traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents, medical services, and auto repair services vary by community. To
respond to these local differences, we are organized as follows:



•Personal Lines– One Group President manages our Personal Lines business, which includes insurance for personal autos and special lines
products (e.g., motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items):



•We currently write personal auto insurance in all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, and on an Internet-only basis in Australia. Our
personal auto management group is organized by state into four geographic regions in the United States, plus a region for Australia. Each region is led by a general manager, as well as a separate manager for our California Agency organization.



•We write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states. Our special lines management group is organized by product and led by a general
manager.



•Commercial Auto– One Group President manages our Commercial Auto business, which offers products in 49 states; we do not currently write
Commercial Auto in Hawaii or the District of Columbia. The Commercial Auto business is organized by state, with product managers responsible for local implementation. These state-level managers are led by two regional directors who report to a
general manager.



•Claims– One Group President manages our Claims business area, which is organized into four groups. Three of the groups are based on
geographic region, and one is a nationwide group that provides various claims-related services, including catastrophe response and special investigations. Each group is headed by a general manager, and each handles both Personal Lines and Commercial
Auto claims.

Our customer service groups, located at call centers in Mayfield Village, Ohio; Austin, Texas; Tampa, Florida;
Sacramento, California; Tempe, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado, support our policy servicing, agency distribution, claims, and direct sales operations.






Our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions. This team includes the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer, and Chief Marketing Officer, as well as our three Group Presidents (discussed above). The Group
Presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance
products.

Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted to a
specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. The Personal Lines business accounted for approximately 90% of total net premiums written for each of the last three years. Our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full
line of auto insurance products with distinctive service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness, brand recognition, service quality, and the actions of our competitors,
among other factors. See “Competitive Factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion.

We ranked fourth in market share in
the U.S. private passenger auto market for 2010 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2011. There are approximately 350 competitors in this market. Progressive and the other leading 15 private passenger auto
insurers, each of which writes over $1.9 billion of premiums, comprise about 75% of this market. For 2010, the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the United States was $158.9 billion, and our share of this market
was approximately 8.0%, compared to $156.6 billion and 7.7% in 2009, respectively; comparable industry data is not available for 2011 at this time. All industry data, including ranking and market share, was obtained directly from data reported by
either SNL Financial or A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), or was estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.

The
Personal Lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products, as well as our special lines products.



•Personal auto insurancerepresented approximately 90% of our total Personal Lines net premiums written for each of the last three years. This
business includes Snapshot®, our usage-based insurance product, which is available to consumers in 39 states and
the District of Columbia in our Direct channel, and in 33 jurisdictions in our Agency channel, with continued expansion planned for 2012, depending on regulatory approval and business results. We currently have four patents, and additional patent
applications pending, with respect to certain methods and systems of providing usage-based insurance. Certain of our patent rights begin to expire on or about January 29, 2016, while others extend well beyond that date.



•Special lines productsinclude insurance for motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items, and represent
about 10% of our Personal Lines business. Due to the nature of these products, we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry
figures are not available, based on our analysis of this market, we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market, and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998. We
also offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 32 states through certain independent agents and to Direct customers via telephone, and plan to continue the roll-out in both channels in 2012.

Our Personal Lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels:



•The Agency businessincludes business written by our network of more than 35,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United
States, including brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines, subject to
compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority on
behalf of Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter into other transactions or commitments. The Agency business also writes through strategic alliance business relationships with other
insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies. The total net premiums written through the Agency business represented 57% of our Personal Lines volume in 2011, compared to 58% in 2010 and 59% in 2009.



•The Direct businessincludes business written directly by us online and over the phone. The Direct business represented 43% of our Personal
Lines volume in 2011, compared to 42% in 2010 and 41% in 2009.

Commercial Auto

The Commercial Auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented
approximately 10% of our total net premiums written for each of the last three years. The majority of our Commercial Auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Auto business, which is primarily distributed through the independent
agency channel, operates in the following business market targets:






•Business auto– autos, vans, and pick-up trucks used by small businesses, such as retailing, farming, services, and private trucking



•Contractor– vans, pick-up trucks, and dump trucks used by small businesses, such as artisan contractors, heavy construction, and
landscapers/snowplowers



•For-hire transportation– tractors, trailers, and straight trucks primarily used by regional general freight and expeditor-type businesses
and non-fleet long-haul operators



•For-hire specialty– dump trucks, log trucks, and garbage trucks used by dirt, sand and gravel, logging, and coal-type businesses, and



•Tow– tow trucks and wreckers used in towing services and gas/service station businesses.

Business auto and contractor are the two largest business market targets, and together account for approximately 60% of our total Commercial Auto
premiums and approximately 75% of the vehicles we insure in this business. Although the Commercial Auto business differs from Personal Lines auto in its customer bases and products written, both businesses require the same fundamental skills,
including disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent claims service.

There are approximately 370 competitors in the total
commercial auto market. We primarily compete with about 34 other large companies/groups, each with over $130 million of commercial auto premiums written annually. These leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75% of this market. Our
Commercial Auto business ranked fourth in the commercial auto insurance market for 2010, and we believe that we will be in the top four for 2011.

Other Indemnity Businesses

Our other indemnity businesses, which represented less
than 1% of our net premiums written in each of the last three years, consist of managing our run-off businesses, including the run-off of our professional liability businesses, which we sold in 2010. Pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of
this business, we will continue to write these policies, principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks, for an agreed upon period after the closing of the sale. From August 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, the
substantial majority of the business written for these policies was 100% reinsured. Beginning in July 2010, all such new and renewal business is 100% reinsured. As of December 31, 2011, we continued to write this business in only two states and
will stop writing all of this business as of April 30, 2012. The sale of these businesses did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Service Businesses

Our service businesses, which represent less than 1% of our
total revenues and do not have a material effect on our operations, primarily include:



•Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP)- We are the only servicing carrier on a nationwide basis for CAIP, which are state-supervised
plans servicing the involuntary market in 42 states and the District of Columbia. As a service provider, we provide policy issuance and claims adjusting services and collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the
related policies. In 2010, we reached an agreement with AIPSO (the national organization responsible for administering the involuntary insurance market) under which we will receive a supplemental fee, when necessary, to satisfy a minimum servicing
fee requirement; this agreement is scheduled to expire on August 31, 2013. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the plans. Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations. Material violations of
contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business. We have maintained, and plan to continue to maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our participation as a CAIP service provider would not
materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.



•Progressive Home
Advantage®- Through Progressive Home Advantage, we offer, either directly or through our network of
independent agents, new and existing Progressive Agency and Direct customers home, condominium, and renters insurance underwritten by unaffiliated homeowner’s insurance companies. Progressive Home Advantage is not available to customers in
Florida and Alaska. For the policies written under this program in our Direct business, we receive commissions, which are used to mitigate the expenses associated with maintaining this program.



•Progressive Commercial AdvantageSM- We currently offer our Commercial Auto customers the ability to package their auto coverage with other commercial
coverages that are underwritten by three unaffiliated insurance companies. This program offers general liability coverage in 19 states and workers’ compensation coverage in 14 states as of December 31, 2011. We receive commissions for the
policies written under this program, which are used to mitigate the expenses associated with maintaining this program.






Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 280 claims offices located throughout the United States. In addition, we have in operation 54 service centers, in 41 metropolitan
areas across the country, that provide our concierge level claims service, of which 7 have combined our claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency. These service centers are designed to provide end-to-end resolution for auto
physical damage losses. Customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle. Our representatives will then write the estimate, select a qualified repair shop, arrange the repair, including
pick-up and delivery of the vehicle, and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete. We hold a U.S. patent for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process, which increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity, and improves
the cycle time in comparison to other claims settlement processes. This patent expires on June 5, 2021.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers
generally compete on the basis of price, consumer recognition and confidence, coverages offered and other product features, claims handling, financial stability, customer service, and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large,
well-capitalized national companies in both the Agency and Direct channels, and by smaller regional issuers. In the Agency channel, some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. Over the last few years,
comparative rating services have gained prominence, adding transparency to industry pricing, and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanded their online service offerings. These
changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other property-casualty insurance markets in which we operate.

We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential. We have
remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate claims adjusting, and strong brand recognition are
also important factors in our competitive strategy.

State Insurance Licenses

Our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable
periodically, provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such licenses are normally issued
only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject
to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and
the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile.
Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its affiliate are domiciled in the states of Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. In addition, California and Florida treat certain Progressive subsidiaries as
domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws.

State insurance laws impose numerous requirements,
conditions, and limitations on the operations of insurance companies. Insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations. Regulated areas include, among others:



•Licensing of insurers and agents



•Capital and surplus requirements



•Statutory accounting principles specific to insurance companies and the content of required financial and other reports



•Requirements for establishing insurance reserves



•Investments



•Acquisitions of insurers and transactions between insurers and affiliates



•Limitations on rates of return or profitability



•Rating criteria, rate levels, and rate changes



•Insolvencies of insurance companies



•Assigned risk programs



•Authority to exit a business, and



•Numerous requirements relating to other areas of insurance operations, including: required coverages, policy forms, underwriting standards, and claims
handling.

Insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’
financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in some states, the attorney
general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and, from time to time, may investigate certain insurance company practices.






Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with
the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business. These reports include:



•the insurer’s financial statements under statutory accounting principles



•details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer



•specific investments held by the insurer, and



•numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations.

State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make. Limitations are placed on the amounts an
insurer may invest in a particular issuer, as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments. Certain investments are prohibited.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of
certain information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between insurers and their
affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in Item 5(c) herein for further information on these dividend limitations. In December 2010, the NAIC promulgated a revised model holding company act, which, to the extent ultimately adopted
by individual state legislatures, will expand the scope of existing insurance holding company regulation.

Under state insolvency and guaranty
laws, insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the state,
to provide coverage to certain risks that cannot find coverage in the voluntary market. These “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well
as the allowable premium. Many states also have involuntary market plans, which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on
to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to
exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan
that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject program
withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses.

As mentioned
above, insurance departments have regulatory authority over many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations, including coverages, forms, rating criteria, and rate levels. The ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis
is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval.

In a number of states, Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries use financial responsibility or credit information (credit) as part of the underwriting or rating process. This practice is expressly
authorized by the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, and our information demonstrates that credit is an effective predictor of insurance risk. The use of credit in underwriting and rating is the subject of significant regulatory and legislative
activity. Regulators and legislators have expressed a number of concerns related to the use of credit, including: questions regarding the accuracy of credit reports, perceptions that credit may have a disparate effect on the poor and certain
minority groups, the perceived lack of a demonstrated causal relationship between credit and insurance risk, the treatment of persons with limited or no credit, the impact on credit of extraordinary life events (e.g., catastrophic injury or death of
a spouse), and the credit attributes applied in the credit scoring models used by insurers. A number of state insurance






departments have issued bulletins, directives, or regulations that regulate or prohibit the use of credit by insurers. In addition, a number of states are considering or have passed legislation
to regulate insurers’ use of credit information. The use of credit information continues to be a regulatory and legislative issue, and it is possible that the U.S. Congress or one or more states may enact further legislation affecting its use
in underwriting and rating.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise. Some changes may
be due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks, while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy, insurance availability, prices,
allegations of discriminatory pricing, underwriting practices and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures, and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer
information, use of credit information in underwriting and rating, insurance rate development, rate of return limitations, and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies. In addition, from time to time, the United States
Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created a new Federal
Insurance Office, which is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk.

In
addition to our U.S. operations, we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in Australia through a branch of one of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. This insurance is offered solely through the Internet. We do not
write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in Australia. There are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in Australia: the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which regulates customer disclosures, and the
Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, which regulates solvency. Both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction, issue regulations, take enforcement actions, and, in general, have broad regulatory powers. Progressive Direct Insurance
Company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing.






Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Certain
significant differences are described below:





CategoryGAAP AccountingSAP Accounting

Acquisition ExpensesCommissions, premium taxes, and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized pro rata over the policy term as
premiums are earned.Commissions, premium taxes, and all other acquisition expenses are expensed as incurred.



Non-admitted AssetsPremium receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.Premium receivables over 90 days past due are “non-admitted,” which means they are excluded from surplus. For premium receivables less than 90 days past due, we also
estimate a bad debt reserve.



Furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives or periods benefited.Excluding computer equipment and operating software, the value of all other furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses, net of
accumulated depreciation or amortization, is non-admitted against surplus. Computer equipment and operating software are capitalized, subject to statutory limitations based on surplus, and depreciated over three years.



Deferred tax assets are recorded based on estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences. A valuation allowance would be recorded for any tax benefits that are
not expected to be realized.The accounting for deferred tax assets is consistent with GAAP, except for certain deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition, which are
non-admitted against surplus.



ReinsuranceCeded reinsurance balances are shown as an asset on the balance sheet as “prepaid reinsurance premiums” and “reinsurance recoverables.”Ceded unearned premiums are netted against the “unearned premiums” liability. Ceded unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) amounts are netted against “loss and
LAE reserves.” Only ceded paid loss and LAE are shown as a “reinsurance recoverables” asset.



Investment ValuationFixed-maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are reported at current fair values.Fixed-maturity securites are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the NAIC designation of the security.



Preferred stocks, both redeemable and nonredeemable, are reported at quoted fair values.Redeemable preferred stocks are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the NAIC designation of the security. Nonredeemable preferred
stocks are reported at quoted fair value, consistent with GAAP.



Federal Income TaxesFederal tax expense and tax liability or recoverable balances include current and deferred income taxes.For income statement reporting, federal tax expense only includes the current tax provision. Deferred taxes are posted to surplus. SAP deferred tax assets are subject to certain
limitations on admissibility.

Investments

Our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write. Our portfolio is invested primarily
in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $16.0 billion at December 31, 2011, compared to $15.5 billion at December 31, 2010. Investment income is affected
by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio, changes in yield, and other factors. Total investment income, including net realized gains (losses) on securities, before
expenses and taxes, was $582.6 million in 2011, compared to $616.2 million in 2010 and $534.1 million in 2009. For more detailed discussion, seeManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsin our
Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.






Employees

The number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2011 was 25,007, all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years:

RECONCILIATION OF NET RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES



(millions)201120102009Balance at January 1$7,071.0$6,653.0$6,177.4Less reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses704.1529.4244.5Net balance at January 16,366.96,123.65,932.9Incurred related to:Current year10,876.810,451.710,040.9Prior years(242.0)(320.4)(136.0)Total incurred10,634.810,131.39,904.9Paid related to:Current year7,289.36,841.06,542.2Prior years3,252.33,047.03,172.0Total paid10,541.69,888.09,714.2Net balance at December 316,460.16,366.96,123.6Plus reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses785.7704.1529.4Balance at December 31$7,245.8$7,071.0$6,653.0

Our reserves developed favorably in each of the last three years, which is reflected as “Incurred related to prior
years” in the table above. Total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves, based on regularly scheduled reviews, claims settling for more or less than reserved, changes in reserve
estimates by claim representatives, and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than reserved. The favorable reserve development, for 2011 and 2010 for our Personal Lines business (primarily personal auto) and for the last three years for
our Commercial Auto business, reflected the settlement of larger losses for amounts less than we originally reserved. During the last three years, we also experienced lower than expected defense and cost containment costs, reflecting a combination
of fewer claims being litigated, as well as the fact that a greater percentage of these cases are now being handled by our in-house counsel, which is a cost-effective alternative to using external law firms. In addition, for 2010, our IBNR reserves
developed favorably due to lower severity and frequency of late emerging claims. However, in 2011, the number of late emerging claims increased over 2010 and was greater than anticipated by our carried IBNR; thus, we recognized unfavorable
development on our total IBNR reserves.

In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by
anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written. These severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions,
claims resolution practices, and general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves.

and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on net unpaid losses at the balance sheet date.

2Cumulative
development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE - Net.






The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from 2001 through
2010. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated
amount of losses and LAE for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross and net basis, with separate disclosure of the re-estimated
reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative
amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded
liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The re-estimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date. The estimate is increased or decreased as more
information about the claims becomes known for individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2011, our insurance subsidiaries had paid $3,449.7 million of the currently estimated $3,475.9 million of losses and LAE that had been unpaid at
the end of 2002; thus, an estimated $26.2 million of losses incurred through 2002 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The “Net Cumulative Development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years. For example, the 2001
liability has developed favorably by $69.7 million over ten years. That amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2003. The effects on income during the past three years due to
changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on page 9 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of the
development related to losses settled in 2011, but incurred in 2008, will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2008, 2009, and 2010. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not
necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

For
2001, while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity, our developed reserves were within 2.5% of our original estimates. Our bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005; thus, the reserve run-off
for these years was very favorable following the end of each year, or about 4% to 9% of our original carried amounts. The reserve development for 2006 and 2007 was less than 4% of our original carried reserves. For both 2008 and 2009, we experienced
favorable reserve development of more than 6% of our original estimates, which reflects the decreases in severity we experienced in both our personal auto (about 3.5%) and Commercial Auto (about 5%) businesses through 2011. The favorable development
of approximately 4% for 2010 also reflects lower severity estimates for both personal auto and Commercial Auto, but to a lesser extent than the previous two years.

Although the detail is not presented in the table on page 10, we also re-estimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year. The top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables
on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year, while the bottom shows the reserves re-estimated based on development in subsequent years. For example, at December 31, 2010, we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid
losses to be $704.1 million. During 2011, these reserves developed unfavorably by $47.6 million, bringing the re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to $751.7 million, as shown at the bottom of the table. Over the last ten years, we
experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses. This development primarily reflects our claims organization’s continuing process of re-evaluating Michigan personal injury protection claims that require
lifetime reserve estimates. As a result, we increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables, since these claims are reinsured through the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) state-mandated plan. The MCCA is
funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state; therefore, our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal.

The Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development table on page 10 is constructed from Schedule P, Part-1, from the Consolidated Annual Statements of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries,
as filed with the state insurance departments.
