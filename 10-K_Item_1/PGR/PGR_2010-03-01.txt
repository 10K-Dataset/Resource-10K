ITEM 1.BUSINESS

(a)
General Development of Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an
insurance holding company formed in 1965, currently has 53 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance company affiliate. These insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty property-casualty
insurance and related services. Our property-casualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles and uninsured and underinsured bodily injury, and liability to others for
personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations. We operate our businesses throughout the United States. In December 2009, we began
selling personal auto insurance in Australia.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated by reference fromNote 10 - Segment Informationin our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial property-casualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $14.0 billion in 2009, compared to $13.6 billion in 2008
and $13.8 billion in 2007. Our combined ratio, calculated on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was 91.6 in 2009, 94.6 in 2008, and 92.6 in 2007.

Organization

Auto
insurance differs greatly by community because regulations and legal decisions vary by state and because, among other factors, traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents, medical services, and auto repair services vary by
community. To respond to these local differences, we are organized as follows:



•Our Personal Lines products are comprised of insurance for personal autos and special lines products (e.g., motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes,
watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items):



•We currently write personal auto insurance in all 50 of the United States and in the District of Columbia. In December 2009, we also began writing
personal auto insurance in Australia. We began writing in Massachusetts in 2008. Our personal auto management group is organized by state into four geographic regions in the United States, plus a region for Australia. Each region is led by a general
manager.



•We write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states. Our special lines management group is organized by product and led by a general
manager.



•Our Commercial Auto products are offered in 49 states; we do not currently write Commercial Auto in Hawaii or the District of Columbia. The Commercial
Auto business is organized by state, with product managers responsible for local implementation. These state-level managers are led by a general manager.



•Our Claims business area, which supports both the Personal Lines and Commercial Auto businesses, is organized into three geographic regions, with a
general manager responsible for each region.



•Our business area general managers each report to one of our Group Presidents (discussed below).

Our Direct sales and customer service groups, located at call centers in Mayfield Village, Ohio; Austin, Texas; Tampa, Florida; Sacramento, California;
Tempe, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado, support our policy servicing, agency distribution, and claims operations.

Our executive
management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Human Resource Officer, as well as
our three Group Presidents (Personal Lines, Commercial Lines, and Claims). The Group Presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique
characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance products.






Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted to a
specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. The Personal Lines business accounted for approximately 89% of total net premiums written for 2009 and approximately 87% for both 2008 and 2007. Our strategy is to be a competitively priced
provider of a full line of auto insurance products with distinctive service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers.

We
ranked fourth in market share in the U.S. private passenger auto market for 2008 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2009. There are approximately 370 competitors in this market. Progressive and the other leading
14 private passenger auto insurers, each of which writes over $2.0 billion of premiums, comprise about 75% of this market. For 2009, the estimated industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the United States was $158.7
billion, and our share of this market was approximately 7.6%, compared to $157.9 billion and 7.3%, respectively, in 2008, and $159.1 billion and 7.3% in 2007. Except as otherwise noted, all industry data and our market share or ranking in the
industry either were derived directly from data reported by A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”) or were estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.

Personal auto insurance represented approximately 90% of our total Personal Lines net premiums written for each of the last three years. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness, brand
recognition, service quality, and the actions of our competitors, among other factors. See “Competitive Factors” on page 4 of this report for further discussion.

Our specialty Personal Lines products include insurance for motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items. Due to the nature of these products, we typically experience
higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available, based on our analysis of this market, we believe that we are one of the
largest participants in the specialty personal lines market, and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998.

The Personal Lines business is either generated by independent agents and brokers or written directly online or by phone. The Agency business includes business written by our network of more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies
located throughout the United States, as well as brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed
underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk. The agents
and brokers do not have authority on behalf of Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter into other transactions or commitments. The Agency business also writes through strategic alliance
business relationships with other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies. In 2009, the total net premiums written through the Agency business represented 59% of our Personal Lines volume, compared to 62% in 2008 and 63%
in 2007.

The Direct business includes business written directly by us online and over the phone. Net premiums written in the Direct business
were 41%, 38%, and 37% of our Personal Lines volume in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Progressive Home
Advantage®, our offering which combines a Progressive auto policy with a homeowner’s or renter’s
policy, underwritten by one of three unaffiliated insurance carriers, is available to Agency customers in 41 states and to Direct customers in 48 states and the District of Columbia; this program is not available to Direct customers in Florida and
Alaska.

We also currently offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 30 states through certain independent agents and to Direct business
customers via telephone. We began offering this product in select markets in 2006 and have been expanding into additional markets as we have evaluated and met certain performance criteria. We plan to continue the roll-out in both channels during
2010.

Commercial Auto

The Commercial Auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 11% of our total net premiums written
for 2009 and approximately 13% for both 2008 and 2007. The majority of our Commercial Auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Auto business, which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the
business auto and specialty truck markets. The business auto market, which accounts for slightly more than half of our total Commercial Auto premiums and approximately 60% of the vehicles we insure in this business, includes autos, vans, and pick-up
trucks used by artisans, such as contractors, landscapers, and plumbers, and a variety of other small businesses. The remainder is in the specialty truck commercial auto market, which includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage,
and other short-haul commercial vehicles. By the end of 2009, we substantially completed the roll-out of our cargo and general liability insurance products, which we introduced in 2007. Although the Commercial Auto business differs from Personal
Lines auto in its customer bases and products written, both businesses require the same fundamental skills, including disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent claims service.






There are approximately 380 competitors in the total commercial auto market. We primarily compete with 32
other large companies/groups, each with over $160 million of commercial auto premiums written annually. These leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75% of this market. Our Commercial Auto business ranked fourth in the commercial auto
insurance market for 2008, and we believe that we held that position for 2009.

Other Indemnity Businesses

Our other indemnity businesses, which represented less than 1% of our net premiums written in each of the last three years, primarily
include writing professional liability insurance for community banks, principally directors and officers liability insurance. The program, sponsored by the American Bankers Association (ABA), insures over 1,600 banks, representing every state. In
addition, our other indemnity businesses include managing our run-off businesses.

We have entered into an agreement to sell our community
bank program to an ABA affiliate. The transaction is expected to close during the first half of 2010. As an interim measure, effective August 1, 2009, we began reinsuring 100% of this risk with another carrier. Prior to August 1, 2009, we
reinsured the majority of the risk on the professional liability insurance coverages with a small mutual reinsurer controlled by its bank customers and various other reinsurance entities. The sale of this business will not have a material effect on
our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Service Businesses

Our service businesses provide insurance-related services and represented less than 1% of our revenues for each of the last three years.

Our principal service business is providing policy issuance and claims adjusting services for the Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP), which
are state-supervised plans serving the involuntary market in 43 states. We have previously competed with two other carriers for the majority of the CAIP market. However, both of these other carriers withdrew, leaving us as the largest CAIP provider
countrywide. Although our market share increased, we did not realize an increase to revenues as the downturn in the CAIP market continues. As a service provider, we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the related
policies. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the plans. Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations. Material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the
affected business. We have maintained, and plan to continue to maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our participation as a CAIP service provider would not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash
flows.

Our service businesses also include our alliance with three select homeowner insurance companies. Through
Progressive Home Advantage®, we act as an agent to offer new and existing Progressive customers home, condo, and
renters insurance underwritten by these homeowner’s insurance companies. Commissions received from this business are used to mitigate the underwriting expenses associated with maintaining this program. This program is available to our Personal
Lines customers in 48 states and the District of Columbia; it is not currently available in Alaska or Florida.

Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 370 claims offices located throughout the United States. In
addition, we have in operation 54 centers, in 41 metropolitan areas across the country, that provide our concierge level claims service. These facilities are designed to provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses. Customers can
choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle. Our representatives will then write the estimate, select a qualified repair shop, arrange the repair, including pick-up and delivery of the vehicle, and
inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete. We received a U.S. patent in 2008 for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process, which increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity, and improves the cycle time and quality of
repairs.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, consumer recognition, coverages
offered and other product features, claims handling, financial stability, customer service, and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national companies in both the Agency and Direct channels, and by
smaller regional issuers. In the Agency channel, some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. Over the last few years, comparative rating services have gained prominence, adding transparency to industry
pricing, and many of our competitors have significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanded their online service offerings. These changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other
property-casualty insurance markets.






We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price
accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate claims
adjusting, and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.

State Insurance
Licenses

Our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses may be of
perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such
licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. At least one of our insurance
subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject
to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its affiliate are domiciled in the states of Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and
Wisconsin. State insurance departments have broad administrative powers relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating premium changes and policy forms, establishing reserve requirements, regulating compliance with statutory accounting
methods, and the content of statutory financial reports, and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval.

Insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a
variety of operational standards. Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business. Insurance departments are authorized to make
periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and
regulations.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions
of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate
dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between regulated insurers and their affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in Item 5(c) herein for further information on these dividend limitations.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover
policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the state, to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market.
These “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a
limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Certain states also prohibit an insurer
from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance






department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject program withdrawals to prior
approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses.

Regulation of insurance constantly
changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise. Some changes may be due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products, while others result from consumer resistance to price
increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures, and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public
consumer information, use of credit information in underwriting, insurance rate development, rate of return limitations, and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies, reflecting concerns about consumer privacy, insurance
availability, prices, and alleged discriminatory pricing. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is
necessary.

We began writing personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in Australia through a branch of one of our U.S. insurance
subsidiaries. This insurance is offered solely through the Internet. We do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in Australia. There are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in Australia: the Australian
Securities and Investment Commission regulates customer disclosures, and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority regulates solvency. Both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction, issue regulations, take enforcement actions, and, in
general, have broad regulatory powers. Progressive Direct Insurance Company has been issued licenses by both agencies.






Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP)
prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Certain significant differences are described below:





CategoryGAAP AccountingSAP Accounting

Acquisition ExpensesCommissions, premium taxes, and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized pro rata over the policy term as
premiums are earned.Commissions, premium taxes, and all other acquisition expenses are expensed as incurred.



Non-admitted AssetsPremium receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.Premium receivables over 90 days past due are “non-admitted,” which means they are excluded from surplus. For premium receivables less than 90 days past due, we also
estimate a bad debt reserve.



Furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives or periods benefited.Excluding computer equipment and operating software, the value of all other furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses, net of
accumulated depreciation or amortization, is non-admitted against surplus. Computer equipment and operating software are capitalized, subject to statutory limitations based on surplus, and depreciated over three years.



Deferred tax assets are recorded based on estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences. A valuation allowance would be recorded for any tax benefits that are
not expected to be realized.The accounting for deferred tax assets is consistent with GAAP, except for certain deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition, which are
non-admitted against surplus.



ReinsuranceCeded reinsurance balances are shown as an asset on the balance sheet as “prepaid reinsurance premiums” and “reinsurance recoverables.”Ceded unearned premiums are netted against the “unearned premiums” liability. Ceded unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) amounts are netted against “loss and
LAE reserves.” Only ceded paid loss and LAE are shown as a “reinsurance recoverables” asset.



Investment ValuationFixed-maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are reported at current fair values.Fixed-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the class of security.



Preferred stocks, both redeemable and nonredeemable, are reported at quoted fair values.Redeemable preferred stocks are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the class of security. Nonredeemable preferred stocks are
reported at quoted fair value, consistent with GAAP.



Federal Income TaxesFederal tax expense and tax liability or recoverable balances include current and deferred income taxes.For income statement reporting, federal tax expense only includes the current tax provision. Deferred taxes are posted to surplus. SAP deferred tax assets are subject to certain
limitations on admissibility.

Investments

Our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can
profitably write. Our portfolio is invested primarily in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $14.7 billion at December 31, 2009, compared to $13.0 billion at
December 31, 2008. Investment income is affected by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio, changes in yield, and other factors. Total investment income (loss),
including net realized gains (losses) on securities, before expenses and taxes, was $534.1 million in 2009, compared to $(807.4) million in 2008 and $787.1 million in 2007. For more detailed discussion, seeManagement’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsin our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.






Employees

The number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2009 was 24,661, all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the
last three years:

RECONCILIATION OF NET RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES

Our objective is to establish case and IBNR reserves that are adequate
to cover all loss costs, while sustaining minimal variation from the date that the reserves are initially established until losses are fully developed. Our reserves developed favorably in 2009, compared to unfavorable development in both 2008 and
2007. Total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves, based on regularly scheduled reviews, claims settling for more or less than reserved, emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different
than reserved, and changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives. In 2009, the favorable development was primarily related to lower than expected defense and cost containment reserves and favorable settlements on larger losses in our
Commercial Auto business. In 2008, an increase in the number of late reported Commercial Auto claims, and an increase in the estimated severity on these claims, was a primary contributor to the unfavorable development. The unfavorable development in
2007 was due to the settlement of some large outstanding litigation, the number of large losses emerging from prior accident years being more than anticipated, plus the result of reviews of large bodily injury and uninsured motorist claims.

In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of
factors that vary with the individual type of policies written. These severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions, claims resolution practices, and
general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary.

We
have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves.

development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE - Net.






The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from 1999 through
2008. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated
amount of losses and LAE for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross and net basis, with separate disclosure of the re-estimated
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative
amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded
liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The re-estimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date. The estimate is increased or decreased as more
information about the claims becomes known for individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2009, our insurance subsidiaries had paid $2,654.6 million of the currently estimated $2,683.5 million of losses and LAE that had been unpaid at
the end of 2000; thus, an estimated $28.9 million of losses incurred through 2000 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years. For example, the 1999 liability has developed unfavorably by $86.5 million over ten years. That amount has been reflected in
income over the ten years and had the largest impact on the income in calendar year 2000. The effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on
page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative
development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2009, but incurred in 2006, will be included in the cumulative
development amount for years 2006, 2007, and 2008. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future
development based on this table.

From 1999 through 2001, while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity, our developed reserves
were within 4% of our original estimates. The bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005; thus, the reserve run-off for these years was very favorable following the end of each year, or about 4% to 10% of our
original carried amounts. The reserve development for each of 2006 through 2008 was less than 3% of our original carried reserves.

Although
the detail is not presented in the table on page 9, we also re-estimate the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses each year. The top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar
year, while the bottom shows the reserves re-estimated based on development in subsequent years. For example, at December 31, 2008, we estimated our reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to be $244.5 million. During 2009, these reserves
developed unfavorably by $274.1 million, bringing the re-estimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to $518.6 million, as shown at the bottom of the table. Over the last ten years, we experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance
recoverables on unpaid losses. This development primarily reflects our claims organization re-evaluating Michigan personal injury protection claims that require lifetime reserve estimates. As a result, we increased both our direct reserves and
corresponding reinsurance recoverables, since these claims are reinsured through the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) state-mandated plan. The MCCA is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in
the state; therefore, our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal.
