ITEM 1.BUSINESS

(a) General Development of
Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an insurance holding company formed
in 1965, currently has 54 subsidiaries, 1 mutual insurance company affiliate, and 1 limited partnership investment affiliate. Our insurance subsidiaries and mutual insurance company affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and
other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services. Our property-casualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles, uninsured and underinsured bodily injury,
and liability to others for personal injury or property damage arising out of the use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries and limited partnership investment affiliate generally support our insurance and investment operations. We
operate our businesses throughout the United States and sell personal auto insurance on an Internet-only basis in Australia.

(b) Financial
Information About Segments

Incorporated by reference fromNote 10 - Segment Informationin our Annual Report, which is included as
Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial property-casualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $16.4 billion in 2012, compared to $15.1 billion in 2011
and $14.5 billion in 2010. Our combined ratio, which we calculate by dividing the sum of our loss and loss adjustment expenses, policy acquisition costs, and other underwriting expenses, net of fees and other revenues, by our net premiums earned,
was 95.6 in 2012, 93.0 in 2011, and 92.4 in 2010.

Organization

Auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because, among other factors, traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents, medical
services, and auto repair services vary by community. To respond to these local differences, we are organized as follows:



•Personal Lines– A Group President manages our Personal Lines business, which includes insurance for personal autos and special lines
products (e.g., motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items):



•We currently write personal auto insurance in all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, and on an Internet-only basis in Australia. Our
personal auto management group is organized by state into four geographic regions in the United States, plus a region for Australia. Each region is led by a general manager. We have a separate manager for our California Agency organization.



•We write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states. Our special lines management group is organized by product and led by a general
manager.



•Commercial Auto– A Group President manages our Commercial Auto business, which offers products in 49 states; we do not currently write
Commercial Auto in Hawaii or the District of Columbia. The Commercial Auto business is organized by state, with product managers responsible for local implementation. These state-level managers are led by two regional directors who report to a
general manager.



•Claims– A Group President manages our Claims business function, which is organized into four groups. Three of the groups are based on
geographic region, and one is a countrywide group that provides various claims-related services, including catastrophe response and special investigations. Each group is headed by a general manager, and each handles both Personal Lines and
Commercial Auto claims.

Our customer service groups, located at call centers in Mayfield Village, Ohio; Austin, Texas;
Tampa, Florida; Sacramento, California; Tempe, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado, support our policy servicing, agency distribution, claims, and direct sales operations.






Our executive management team sets policies and makes key strategic decisions. This team includes the Chief
Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer, and Chief Marketing Officer, as well as our three Group Presidents (discussed above). The Group
Presidents are responsible for the development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select our insurance
products.

Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted to a
specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. The Personal Lines business accounted for approximately 90% of total net premiums written during each of the last three years. Our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full
line of auto insurance products with distinctive service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness, brand recognition, service quality, and the actions of our competitors,
among other factors. See “Competitive Factors” on page 5 of this report for further discussion.

We ranked fourth in market share in
the U.S. private passenger auto market for 2011 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2012. There are approximately 340 competitors in this market. Progressive and the other leading 13 private passenger auto
insurers, each of which writes over $2.0 billion of premiums, comprise about 75% of this market. For 2011, the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the United States was $163.0 billion, and our share of this market
was approximately 8.2%, compared to $160.1 billion and 7.9% in 2010, respectively; comparable industry data is not available for 2012 at this time. All industry data, including ranking and market share, was obtained directly from data reported by
either SNL Financial or A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), or was estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.

The
Personal Lines segment consists of our personal auto insurance products, as well as our special lines products.



•Personal auto insurancerepresented approximately 90% of our total Personal Lines net premiums written for each of the last three years. This
business includes Snapshot®, our usage-based insurance product, which is available to consumers through both the
Agency and Direct channels in 38 states and the District of Columbia and to consumers in 5 more states in our Direct channel only; continued expansion is planned for 2013, depending on regulatory approval and business results.



•Special lines productsinclude insurance for motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items, and represent
about 10% of our Personal Lines business. Due to the nature of these products, we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry
figures are not available, based on our analysis of this market, we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market, and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998. We
also offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 32 states through certain independent agents and to Direct customers via telephone.

Our Personal Lines products are sold through both the agency and direct channels:



•The Agency businessincludes business written by our network of more than 35,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United
States, including brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines, subject to
compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority on
behalf of Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter into other transactions or commitments. The Agency business writes insurance through strategic alliance business relationships with other
insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies. The total net premiums written through the Agency business represented 56% of our Personal Lines volume in 2012, compared to 57% in 2011 and 58% in 2010.



•The Direct businessincludes business written directly by us online, via mobile devices, and over the phone. The Direct business represented 44%
of our Personal Lines volume in 2012, compared to 43% in 2011 and 42% in 2010.

Commercial Auto

The Commercial Auto business writes primary liability and physical damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented
approximately 10% of our total net premiums written during each of the last three years. The






majority of our Commercial Auto customers insure two or fewer vehicles. The Commercial Auto business, which
is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the following business market targets:



•Business auto– autos, vans, and pick-up trucks used by small businesses, such as retailing, farming, services, and private trucking



•For-hire transportation– tractors, trailers, and straight trucks primarily used by regional general freight and expeditor-type businesses
and non-fleet long-haul operators



•Contractor– vans, pick-up trucks, and dump trucks used by small businesses, such as artisans, heavy construction, and
landscapers/snowplowers



•For-hire specialty– dump trucks, log trucks, and garbage trucks used by dirt, sand and gravel, logging, and coal-type businesses, and



•Tow– tow trucks and wreckers used in towing services and gas/service station businesses.

Business auto is the largest business market target, measured by premium volume, and accounts for approximately one third of our total Commercial Auto
premiums, while the for-hire transportation and contractor business market targets each account for another 25%. Business auto and contractor each account for approximately one third of the vehicles we insure in this business, while for-hire
transportation accounts for about 15%. Although the Commercial Auto business differs from Personal Lines auto in its customer bases and products written, both businesses require the same fundamental skills, including disciplined underwriting and
pricing, as well as excellent claims service.

There are approximately 340 competitors in the total commercial auto market. We primarily
compete with about 31 other large companies/groups, each with over $130 million of commercial auto premiums written annually. These leading commercial auto insurers comprise about 75% of this market. Our Commercial Auto business ranked third in the
commercial auto insurance market for 2011, and we believe that we will rank second for 2012.

Other Indemnity

Our other indemnity businesses consist of managing our run-off businesses, including the run-off of our professional liability business, which was sold in
2010. Pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this business, from the date of sale through April 30, 2012, we continued to write these policies, principally directors and officers liability insurance for community banks, which were 100%
reinsured. The sale of this business did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Service Businesses

Our service
businesses, which represent less than 1% of our total revenues and do not have a material effect on our operations, primarily include:



•Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP)– We are the only servicing carrier on a nationwide basis for CAIP, which are
state-supervised plans servicing the involuntary market in 42 states and the District of Columbia. As a service provider, we provide policy issuance and claims adjusting services and collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the
terms of the related policies. In 2010, we reached an agreement with AIPSO (the national organization responsible for administering the involuntary insurance market) under which we will receive a supplemental fee, when necessary, to satisfy a
minimum servicing fee requirement; this agreement is scheduled to expire on August 31, 2014. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the plans. Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations. Material
violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business. We have maintained, and plan to continue to maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our participation as a CAIP service
provider would not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.



•Commission-Based Businesses –We have two commission-based service businesses.

Through Progressive Home Advantage®, we offer, either directly or through our network of independent agents, new and existing Agency and Direct customers home, condominium, and renters insurance written
by unaffiliated homeowner’s insurance companies. Progressive Home Advantage is not available to customers in Florida and Alaska. For the policies written under this program in our Direct business, we receive commissions, all of which are used
to offset the expenses associated with maintaining this program.

Through Progressive Commercial
AdvantageSM, we offer our customers the ability to package
their auto coverage with other commercial coverages that are underwritten by four unaffiliated insurance companies or placed with other companies through an unaffiliated agency. This program offers general liability and business owners policies in
the 49 states where we write commercial auto insurance and workers’ compensation coverage in 14 states as of December 31, 2012. We receive commissions for the policies written under this program, all of which are used to offset the
expenses associated with maintaining this program.






Claims

We manage our claims handling on a companywide basis through approximately 280 claims offices located throughout the United States. In addition, we have in operation 54 service centers, in 41 metropolitan
areas across the country, that provide our concierge level claims service, of which 14 have combined our claims offices and service centers to improve our efficiency. If a customer elects to repair their vehicle through this option, these service
centers provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses. Customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle. Our representatives will then select a qualified repair shop, arrange
the repair, including pick-up and delivery of the vehicle, and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete. We also guarantee the repairs for as long as the customer owns or leases their car. If a customer decides not to repair their
vehicle, our representatives will write an estimate and the customer can receive payment on the spot. This innovative approach to the vehicle repair process increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in
comparison to our other claims settlement processes.

Competitive Factors

The automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on
the basis of price, agent commission rates, consumer recognition and confidence, coverages offered and other product features, claims handling, financial stability, customer service, and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by
large, well-capitalized national companies in both the Agency and Direct channels, and by smaller regional insurers. In the Agency channel, some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. With widely available
comparative rating services, consumers can easily compare prices among competitors. Many competitors invest heavily in advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanding their online service offerings. Over the past decade, these changes have
further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and other property-casualty insurance markets in which we operate.

We rely
heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing
expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer service, fair and accurate claims adjusting, and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.

Competition in our insurance markets is affected by the pace of technological developments. An insurer’s ability to innovate, develop, and implement
new applications and other technology can affect its competitive position. In addition, there has been a proliferation of patents related to new ways in which vehicle insurance is being offered, sold, and serviced. We have six U.S. patents, and
additional U.S. patent applications pending, with respect to certain methods, systems, and devices related to usage-based insurance. Certain of these patent rights expire on or about January 29, 2016, while others extend well beyond that date.
We also have a significant amount of “know-how” developed from years of experience with, and data derived from over 5 billion miles related to usage-based insurance. We believe this intellectual property provides us with a competitive
advantage in the usage-based insurance market. During 2012, we began to pursue ways in which to leverage this intellectual property. Currently, we do not expect these activities to have a material effect on our operations, results of operations, or
financial condition in the current fiscal year. We also hold a U.S. patent (expiring June 2021), and a U.S. patent application pending, on our innovative approach to the vehicle repair service described above and two patents (expiring July 2019),
and additional patents pending, related to our online policy self-service technology.

State Insurance Licenses

Our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses may be of perpetual duration or renewable
periodically, provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing state. Such licenses are normally issued
only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally
subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50
states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of
domicile. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its mutual insurance company affiliate are domiciled in the states of Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. In addition, California and Florida treat
certain Progressive subsidiaries as domestic insurers for certain purposes under their “commercial domicile” laws.






State insurance laws impose numerous requirements, conditions, and limitations on the operations of
insurance companies. Insurance departments have broad regulatory powers relating to those operations. Regulated areas include, among others:



•Licensing of insurers and agents



•Capital and surplus requirements



•Statutory accounting principles specific to insurance companies and the content of required financial and other reports



•Requirements for establishing insurance reserves



•Investments



•Acquisitions of insurers and transactions between insurers and affiliates



•Limitations on rates of return or profitability



•Rating criteria, rate levels, and rate changes



•Insolvencies of insurance companies



•Assigned risk programs



•Authority to exit a business, and



•Numerous requirements relating to other areas of insurance operations, including: required coverages, policy forms, underwriting standards, and claims
handling.

Insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’
financial condition and operations to monitor the financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in some states, the attorney
general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and, from time to time, may investigate certain insurance company practices.

Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they
conduct business. These reports include:



•the insurer’s financial statements under statutory accounting principles



•details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer



•specific investments held by the insurer, and



•numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations.

State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate investments that insurers are permitted to make. Limitations are placed on the amounts an
insurer may invest in a particular issuer, as well as the aggregate amount an insurer may invest in certain types of investments. Certain investments are prohibited.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions authorize insurance departments to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of
specified information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between insurers and
their affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in Item 5(c) herein for further information on these dividend limitations. The scope of insurance holding company regulation has expanded as states have adopted the revised model
holding company act promulgated by the NAIC in 2010.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, insurers can be assessed or required to
contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the state, to provide coverage to certain risks that
cannot find coverage in the voluntary market. These “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also
have involuntary market plans, which hire a limited number of servicing carriers






to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile
insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state
insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an
insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses.

As mentioned above, insurance departments have regulatory authority over
many other aspects of an insurer’s insurance operations, including coverages, forms, rating criteria, and rate levels. The ability to implement changes to these items on a timely basis is critical to our ability to compete effectively in the
marketplace. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file and use,” to prior approval.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise. Some changes may be
due to economic developments, such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products or to respond to perceived investment risks, while others reflect concerns about consumer privacy, insurance availability, prices, allegations
of discriminatory pricing, underwriting practices, and solvency. In recent years, legislation, regulatory measures, and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use of
credit information in underwriting and rating, insurance rate development, rate of return limitations, and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies. In addition, from time to time, the United States Congress and certain
federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act created a new Federal Insurance Office, which
is required to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk.

In addition to our U.S.
operations, we write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in Australia through a branch of one of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. This insurance is offered solely through the Internet. We do not write auto bodily
injury liability or medical payment insurance in Australia. There are two primary agencies that regulate insurance in Australia: the Australian Securities and Investment Commission, which regulates customer disclosures, and the Australian Prudential
Regulatory Authority, which regulates solvency. Both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction, issue regulations, take enforcement actions, and, in general, have broad regulatory powers. Progressive Direct Insurance Company has been issued
licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing.






Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Certain
significant differences are described below:





CategoryGAAP AccountingSAP Accounting

AcquisitionExpensesCommissions, premium taxes, and other variable costs incurred in connection with the successful acquisition of new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized pro rata over
the policy term as premiums are earned.Commissions, premium taxes, and all other acquisition expenses are expensed as incurred.



Non-admittedAssetsPremium receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.Premium receivables over 90 days past due are “non-admitted,” which means they are excluded from surplus. For premium receivables less than 90 days past due, we also
estimate a bad debt reserve.



Furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives or periods benefited.Excluding computer equipment and operating software, the value of all other furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses, net of
accumulated depreciation or amortization, is non-admitted against surplus. Computer equipment and operating software are capitalized, subject to statutory limitations based on surplus, and depreciated over three years.



Deferred tax assets are recorded based on estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences. A valuation allowance would be recorded for any tax benefits that are
not expected to be realized.The accounting for deferred tax assets is consistent with GAAP, except for certain deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition, which are
non-admitted against surplus.



ReinsuranceCeded reinsurance balances are shown as an asset on the balance sheet as “prepaid reinsurance premiums” and “reinsurance recoverables.”Ceded unearned premiums are netted against the “unearned premiums” liability. Ceded unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) amounts are netted against “loss and
LAE reserves.” Only ceded paid loss and LAE are shown as a “reinsurance recoverables” asset.



InvestmentValuationFixed-maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are reported at current fair values.Fixed-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the NAIC designation of the security.



Preferred stocks, both redeemable and nonredeemable, are reported at fair values.Redeemable preferred stocks are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the NAIC designation of the security. Nonredeemable preferred
stocks are reported at quoted fair value, consistent with GAAP.



Federal IncomeTaxesFederal tax expense includes current and deferred income taxes.For income statement reporting, federal tax expense only includes the current tax provision. Deferred taxes are posted to surplus. SAP deferred tax assets are subject to certain
limitations on admissibility.

Investments

Our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write. Our portfolio is invested primarily
in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $16.5 billion at December 31, 2012, compared to $16.0 billion at December 31, 2011. Investment income is affected
by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio, changes in yield, and other factors. Total investment income, including net realized gains (losses) on securities, before
expenses and taxes, was $749.8 million in 2012, compared to $582.6 million in 2011 and $616.2 million in 2010. For more detailed discussion, seeManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsin our
Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.






Employees

The number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2012 was 25,889, all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years:

RECONCILIATION OF NET RESERVES FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES



(millions)201220112010Balance at January 1$7,245.8$7,071.0$6,653.0Less reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses785.7704.1529.4Net balance at January 16,460.16,366.96,123.6Incurred related to:Current year11,926.010,876.810,451.7Prior years22.0(242.0)(320.4)Total incurred11,948.010,634.810,131.3Paid related to:Current year7,895.37,289.36,841.0Prior years3,536.53,252.33,047.0Total paid11,431.810,541.69,888.0Net balance at December 316,976.36,460.16,366.9Plus reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses862.1785.7704.1Balance at December 31$7,838.4$7,245.8$7,071.0

Our reserves developed unfavorably by $22.0 million in 2012 and favorably by $242.0 million and $320.4 million in 2011
and 2010, respectively, which is reflected as “Incurred related to prior years” in the table above. Total development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves, based on regularly scheduled
reviews, claims settling for more or less than reserved, changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives, and emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than anticipated.

During 2012, unfavorable reserve development in our personal auto product was primarily attributable to reserve development in our Florida personal injury protection coverage (PIP) and an increase in our
estimate of bodily injury severity for accident year 2011. In addition, unfavorable development in our Commercial Auto business reflects higher than anticipated frequency and severity costs on late emerging claims and higher settlements on large
losses. This unfavorable development was partially offset by favorable reserve adjustments, primarily in our loss adjustment expense reserves and our personal auto bodily injury reserves for accident years 2009 and 2008.

In both 2011 and 2010, the favorable reserve development reflected the settlement of larger losses for amounts less than we originally reserved in our
Personal Lines (primarily in our personal auto product) and Commercial Auto businesses. We also experienced lower than expected defense and cost containment costs, reflecting a combination of fewer claims being litigated, as well as the fact that a
greater percentage of these cases are now being handled by our in-house counsel, which is a cost-effective alternative to using external law firms. In addition, for 2010, our IBNR reserves developed favorably due to lower severity and frequency of
late emerging claims. However, in 2011, the number of late emerging claims increased over 2010 and was greater than anticipated by our carried IBNR, thus we recognized unfavorable development on our total IBNR reserves.






In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by
anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written. These severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions,
claims resolution practices, and general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves.

1Represents loss
and LAE reserves net of reinsurance recoverables on net unpaid losses at the balance sheet date.

2Cumulative
development ÷ liability for unpaid losses and LAE - net.

The above table presents the development of balance sheet
liabilities for losses and LAE from 2002 through 2011. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty insurance
subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated amount of losses and LAE for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross and
net basis, with separate disclosure of the re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses.






The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative amount
paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded liability based
on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The re-estimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date. The estimate is increased or decreased as more information about
the claims becomes known for individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2012, our insurance subsidiaries had paid $4,054.9 million of the currently estimated $4,082.7 million of losses and LAE that had been unpaid at the end of 2003;
thus, an estimated $27.8 million of losses incurred through 2003 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The “Net
Cumulative Development” represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years. For example, the 2002 liability has developed favorably by $152.3 million over ten years. That amount has been reflected in income over
the ten years and had the largest impact on income in calendar year 2005. The effects on income during the past three years due to changes in estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on page 9 as the
“prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount
includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of the development related to losses settled in 2012, but incurred in 2009, will be included in the cumulative development amount for
years 2009, 2010, and 2011. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this
table.

Our bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005; thus, the reserve run-off for these years was
very favorable following the end of each year, or about 4% to 9% of our original carried amounts. The reserve development for 2006 and 2007 was less than 4% of our original carried reserves. For both 2008 and 2009, we experienced favorable reserve
development of more than 6% of our original estimates, which reflects the decreases in severity we experienced in both our personal auto (about 4%) and Commercial Auto (about 6%) businesses through 2012. The favorable development of approximately 5%
for 2010 also reflects lower severity estimates for both personal auto and Commercial Auto, but to a lesser extent than the previous two years. In 2011, we experienced very minimal unfavorable development, or less than 0.5% of our original estimate.

Although the detail is not presented in the table on page 11, we also re-estimate the reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses each year.
The top of the table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year, while the bottom shows the reserves re-estimated based on development in subsequent years. For example, at
December 31, 2011, we estimated our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to be $785.7 million. During 2012, these reserves developed unfavorably by $28.8 million, bringing the re-estimated reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses to
$814.5 million, as shown at the bottom of the table. Over the last ten years, we experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses. This development primarily reflects our claims organization’s continuing
process of re-evaluating Michigan PIP claims that require lifetime reserve estimates. As a result, we increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables, since these claims are reinsured through the Michigan Catastrophic
Claims Association (MCCA) state-mandated plan. The MCCA is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state; therefore, our exposure to losses from the failure of this reinsurer is minimal.

The Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development table on page 11 is constructed from Schedule P, Part-1, from the Consolidated Annual
Statements of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries, as filed with the state insurance departments.
