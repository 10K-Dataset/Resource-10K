ITEM 1.BUSINESS

(a) General Development of
Business

The Progressive insurance organization began business in 1937. The Progressive Corporation, an insurance holding company formed
in 1965, currently has 54 subsidiaries and 1 mutual insurance company affiliate. These insurance subsidiaries and affiliate provide personal and commercial automobile insurance and other specialty property-casualty insurance and related services.
Our property-casualty insurance products protect our customers against losses due to collision and physical damage to their motor vehicles and uninsured and underinsured bodily injury, and liability to others for personal injury or property damage
arising out of the use of those vehicles. Our non-insurance subsidiaries generally support our insurance and investment operations. We operate our businesses throughout the United States and sell personal auto insurance in Australia.

(b) Financial Information About Segments

Incorporated by reference fromNote 10 - Segment Informationin our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.

(c) Narrative Description of Business

We offer a number of personal and commercial property-casualty insurance products primarily related to motor vehicles. Net premiums written were $14.5
billion in 2010, compared to $14.0 billion in 2009 and $13.6 billion in 2008. Our combined ratio, calculated on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), was 92.4 in 2010, 91.6 in 2009,
and 94.6 in 2008.

Organization

Auto insurance differs greatly by community because legal requirements and decisions vary by state and because, among other factors, traffic, law enforcement, cultural attitudes, insurance agents, medical
services, and auto repair services vary by community. To respond to these local differences, we are organized as follows:



•Our Personal Lines products are comprised of insurance for personal autos and special lines products (e.g., motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes,
watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items):



•We currently write personal auto insurance in all 50 of the United States and in the District of Columbia. In December 2009, we began writing personal
auto insurance in Australia. Our personal auto management group is organized by state into four geographic regions in the United States, plus a region for Australia. Each region is led by a general manager.



•We write the majority of our special lines products in all 50 states. Our special lines management group is organized by product and led by a general
manager.



•Our Commercial Auto products are offered in 49 states; we do not currently write Commercial Auto in Hawaii or the District of Columbia. The Commercial
Auto business is organized by state, with product managers responsible for local implementation. These state-level managers are led by two regional directors who are led by a general manager.



•Our Claims business area, which supports both the Personal Lines and Commercial Auto businesses, is organized into three geographic regions, with a
general manager responsible for each region.



•Our Personal Lines, Commercial Auto, and Claims businesses are each managed by a Group President, while our California agency organization is managed
separately.

Our customer service groups, located at call centers in Mayfield Village, Ohio; Austin, Texas; Tampa, Florida;
Sacramento, California; Tempe, Arizona; and Colorado Springs, Colorado, support our policy servicing, agency distribution, claims operations, and direct sales.

Our executive management team sets policy and makes key strategic decisions and includes the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Investment Officer, Chief
Information Officer, Chief Human Resource Officer, and Chief Marketing Officer, as well as our three Group Presidents (discussed above). The Group Presidents are responsible for the






development and management of our product offerings and customer service processes that are tailored to the unique characteristics and purchasing preferences of customers who shop for and select
our insurance products.

Personal Lines

Our Personal Lines segment writes insurance for personal autos and recreational and other vehicles. This business generally offers more than one program in a single state, with each program targeted to a
specific distribution channel, market, or customer group. The Personal Lines business accounted for approximately 90% of total net premiums written for each of the last three years. Our strategy is to be a competitively priced provider of a full
line of auto insurance products with distinctive service, distributed through whichever channel the customer prefers.

We ranked fourth in
market share in the U.S. private passenger auto market for 2009 based on net premiums written and believe that we held that position for 2010. There are approximately 360 competitors in this market. Progressive and the other leading 14 private
passenger auto insurers, each of which writes over $1.8 billion of premiums, comprise about 75% of this market. For 2009, the industry net premiums written for private passenger auto insurance in the United States was $156.5 billion, and our share
of this market was approximately 7.8%, compared to $158.0 billion and 7.3% in 2008, respectively; comparable industry data is not available for 2010 at this time. All industry data, including ranking and market share, was obtained directly from data
reported by either SNL Financial or A.M. Best Company, Inc. (“A.M. Best”), or was estimated using A.M. Best data as the primary source.

Personal auto insurance represented approximately 90% of our total Personal Lines net premiums written for each of the last three years. Volume potential is driven by our price competitiveness, brand
recognition, service quality, and the actions of our competitors, among other factors. See “Competitive Factors” on page 4 of this report for further discussion.

Our specialty Personal Lines products include insurance for motorcycles, ATVs, RVs, mobile homes, watercraft, snowmobiles, and similar items, and represent about 10% of our Personal Lines business. Due to
the nature of these products, we typically experience higher losses during the warmer weather months. Our competitors are specialty companies and large multi-line insurance carriers. Although industry figures are not available, based on our analysis
of this market, we believe that we are one of the largest participants in the specialty personal lines market, and that we have been the market share leader for the motorcycle product since 1998.

The Personal Lines business is either generated by independent agents and brokers or written directly online or by phone. The Agency business includes
business written by our network of more than 30,000 independent insurance agencies located throughout the United States, including brokerages in New York and California. These independent insurance agents and brokers have the ability to place
business with Progressive for specified insurance coverages within prescribed underwriting guidelines, subject to compliance with company-mandated procedures. Our guidelines prescribe the kinds and amounts of coverage that may be written and the
premium rates that may be charged for specified categories of risk. The agents and brokers do not have authority on behalf of Progressive to establish underwriting guidelines, develop rates, settle or adjust claims, or enter into other transactions
or commitments. The Agency business also writes through strategic alliance business relationships with other insurance companies, financial institutions, and national agencies. The total net premiums written through the Agency business represented
58% of our Personal Lines volume in 2010, compared to 59% in 2009 and 62% in 2008.

The Direct business includes business written directly by
us online and over the phone. The Direct business represented 42% of our Personal Lines volume in 2010, compared to 41% in 2009 and 38% in 2008.

SnapshotSM,
our usage-based insurance product, is now available to Direct auto consumers in 27 states, including 8 states added during 2010, and Agency auto customers in 9 of those 27 states. We plan to continue expansion of Snapshot into about 15 additional
states in 2011, depending on regulatory approval and business results. We currently have three patents, and additional patent applications pending, with respect to usage-based insurance.

Progressive Home Advantage®, our offering which is designed to combine a Progressive policy with a homeowner’s or renter’s policy underwritten by one of three unaffiliated insurance
carriers, is available to Agency customers in 43 states and to Direct customers in 48 states and the District of Columbia; this program is not available to customers in Florida and Alaska.

We also offer a personal umbrella insurance product in 32 states through certain independent agents and to Direct customers via telephone. We began offering this product in select markets in 2006 and have
been expanding into additional markets as we have evaluated and met certain performance criteria. We plan to continue the roll-out in both channels during 2011.

Commercial Auto

The Commercial Auto business writes primary liability and physical
damage insurance for automobiles and trucks owned by small businesses and represented approximately 10% of our total net premiums written for each of the last three years. The majority of our Commercial Auto customers insure three or fewer vehicles.
The Commercial Auto business, which is primarily distributed through the independent agency channel, operates in the business auto and truck markets. The business auto market, which accounts for slightly more than half of our total Commercial Auto
premiums and approximately 60% of the vehicles we






insure in this business, includes autos, vans, and pick-up trucks used by small businesses, such as contractors, landscapers, and plumbers. The remainder is in the truck commercial auto market,
which includes dump trucks, logging trucks, tow trucks, local cartage, and other short-haul commercial vehicles. We also offer cargo, general liability, and workers’ compensation insurance products to these same customers; certain of these
products are underwritten by unaffiliated insurance companies through our Progressive Commercial Advantage program. Although the Commercial Auto business differs from Personal Lines auto in its customer bases and products written, both businesses
require the same fundamental skills, including disciplined underwriting and pricing, as well as excellent claims service.

There are
approximately 380 competitors in the total commercial auto market. We primarily compete with about 35 other large companies/groups, each with over $130 million of commercial auto premiums written annually. These leading commercial auto insurers
comprise about 75% of this market. Our Commercial Auto business ranked fourth in the commercial auto insurance market for 2009, and we believe that we will be in the top four for 2010.

Other Indemnity Businesses

Our other indemnity businesses, which represented less
than 1% of our net premiums written in each of the last three years, consist of managing our run-off businesses, which includes the run-off of our professional liability businesses, principally directors and officers liability insurance for
community banks.

In 2010, we sold our professional liability insurance businesses. Pursuant to our agreement with the purchaser of this
business, we will continue to write policies for an agreed upon period after the closing of the sale. From August 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, the substantial majority of the business written for these policies was 100% reinsured.
Beginning in July 2010, all such new and renewal business is 100% reinsured. The sale of these businesses did not have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Service Businesses

Our service
businesses provide insurance-related services and represented less than 1% of our total revenues for each of the last three years and do not have a material effect on our overall operations.

Our service business provides policy issuance and claims adjusting services for the Commercial Auto Insurance Procedures/Plans (CAIP), which are state-supervised plans serving the involuntary market in 43
states. We are the sole nationwide servicing carrier for CAIP. As a service provider, we collect fee revenue that is earned on a pro rata basis over the terms of the related policies. In 2010, we reached an agreement with AIPSO (the national
organization responsible for administering the involuntary insurance market) under which we will receive a supplemental fee, when necessary, to satisfy a minimum servicing fee requirement. We cede 100% of the premiums and losses to the plans.
Reimbursements to us from the CAIP plans are required by state laws and regulations. Material violations of contractual service standards can result in ceding restrictions for the affected business. We have maintained, and plan to continue to
maintain, compliance with these standards. Any changes in our participation as a CAIP service provider would not materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.

Our service businesses also include our alliance with three unaffiliated homeowner insurance companies, of which one company services
our Agency customers, one services our Direct customers, and the third is available to both businesses. Through Progressive Home Advantage®, we offer, either directly or through our network of independent agents, new and existing Progressive Agency and Direct customers home, condo, and renters insurance
underwritten by these homeowner’s insurance companies. For the policies written in our Direct business, we receive commissions, which are used to mitigate the expenses associated with maintaining this program.

Claims

We manage our claims
handling on a companywide basis through approximately 320 claims offices located throughout the United States. In addition, we have in operation 54 service centers, in 41 metropolitan areas across the country, that provide our concierge level claims
service. These facilities are designed to provide end-to-end resolution for auto physical damage losses. Customers can choose to bring their vehicles to one of these sites, where they can pick up a rental vehicle. Our representatives will then write
the estimate, select a qualified repair shop, arrange the repair, including pick-up and delivery of the vehicle, and inspect the vehicle once the repairs are complete. We hold a U.S. patent for this innovative approach to the vehicle repair process,
which increases consumer satisfaction and our productivity and improves the cycle time in comparison to other claims settlement processes.

Competitive Factors

The
automobile insurance and other property-casualty markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Property-casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of price, consumer recognition and confidence, coverages offered and other product
features, claims handling, financial stability, customer service, and geographic coverage. Vigorous competition is provided by large, well-capitalized national companies in both the Agency and Direct channels, and by smaller regional issuers. In the
Agency channel, some of our competitors have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents. Over the last few years, comparative rating services have gained prominence, adding transparency to industry pricing, and many of our competitors
have






significantly increased their advertising and marketing efforts and/or expanded their online service offerings. These changes have further intensified the competitive nature of the automobile and
other property-casualty insurance markets in which we operate.

We rely heavily on technology and extensive data gathering and analysis to
segment markets and price accurately according to risk potential. We have remained competitive by refining our risk measurement and price segmentation skills, closely managing expenses, and achieving operating efficiencies. Superior customer
service, fair and accurate claims adjusting, and strong brand recognition are also important factors in our competitive strategy.

State
Insurance Licenses

Our insurance subsidiaries operate under licenses issued by various state insurance authorities. These licenses may
be of perpetual duration or renewable periodically, provided the holder continues to meet applicable regulatory requirements. Our licenses govern the kinds of insurance coverages that may be written by our insurance subsidiaries in the issuing
state. Such licenses are normally issued only after the filing of an appropriate application and the satisfaction of prescribed criteria. All licenses that are material to the subsidiaries’ businesses are in good standing.

Insurance Regulation

Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries are generally subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they
are domiciled or licensed to transact business. At least one of our insurance subsidiaries is licensed and subject to regulation in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies
from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Generally, an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile. Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries and its affiliate are domiciled in the states of
Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. State insurance departments have broad administrative powers relating to licensing insurers and agents, regulating premium changes and policy forms, establishing reserve
requirements, regulating compliance with statutory accounting methods, and the content of statutory financial reports, and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted. Rate regulation varies from “use and file,” to “file
and use,” to prior approval.

Insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain
adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards. Insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business.
Insurance departments are authorized to conduct periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers’ financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles
and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in some states, the attorney general’s office may exercise certain supervisory authority over insurance companies and, from time to time, may investigate certain insurance
company practices.

Insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate
acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information. These laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally
regulate dividend and other distributions, including loans and cash advances, between regulated insurers and their affiliates. See the “Dividends” discussion in Item 5(c) herein for further information on these dividend limitations.
In December 2010, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) promulgated a revised model holding company act, which, to the extent ultimately adopted by individual state legislatures, will expand the scope of existing insurance
holding company regulation.

Under state insolvency and guaranty laws, regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state
guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers. Insurers are also required by many states, as a condition of doing business in the state, to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in
the voluntary market. These “assigned risk” plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be offered to such involuntary risks, as well as the allowable premium. Many states also have involuntary market
plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks. These plans, through assessments, pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states.

Insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings. Although the
ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors (including applicable law, the type of business being written, the adequacy of the insurer’s reserves, and the quality of the insurer’s
assets), the annual net premiums that an insurer may write have historically been perceived to be limited to a specified multiple of the insurer’s total policyholders’ surplus, generally 3 to 1. Thus, the amount of an insurer’s
surplus, in certain cases, may limit its ability to grow its business. At year-end 2010, we had net premiums written of $14,476.8 million and statutory surplus of $5,073.0 million. The combined premiums to surplus ratio for all Progressive insurance
companies was 2.9 to 1. In addition, we have access to $2.2 billion in a non-insurance subsidiary, portions of which could be contributed to the capital of our insurance subsidiaries to support growth as needed. The NAIC also has developed a
risk-based capital (RBC) program to enable regulators to take appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition. RBC is a series of






dynamic surplus-related formulas that contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on the degree of certain risks, such as asset, credit, and underwriting risks.
Progressive’s RBC ratios are well in excess of minimum requirements.

Many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s
ability to exit a market. For example, certain states limit an automobile insurer’s ability to cancel or non-renew policies. Certain states also prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state, except pursuant
to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. The state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption. Laws and regulations that limit the cancellation or non-renewal of policies, or that subject
program withdrawals to prior approval requirements, may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets or businesses.

Regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise. Some changes may be due to economic developments, such as
changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment products, while others result from consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency. In recent years, legislation,
regulatory measures, and voter initiatives have been introduced, and in some cases adopted, which deal with use of non-public consumer information, use of credit information in underwriting and rating, insurance rate development, rate of return
limitations, and the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew insurance policies, reflecting concerns about consumer privacy, insurance availability, prices, and alleged discriminatory pricing. In addition, from time to time, the United States
Congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary; in 2010, a new Federal Insurance Office was created by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, whose purpose is to collect information about the insurance industry and monitor the industry for systemic risk.

We write personal auto physical damage and property damage liability insurance in Australia
through a branch of one of our U.S. insurance subsidiaries. This insurance is offered solely through the Internet. We do not write auto bodily injury liability or medical payment insurance in Australia. There are two primary agencies that regulate
insurance in Australia: the Australian Securities and Investment Commission regulates customer disclosures, and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority regulates solvency. Both agencies enforce laws within their jurisdiction, issue
regulations, take enforcement actions, and, in general, have broad regulatory powers. Progressive Direct Insurance Company has been issued licenses by both agencies and the licenses are in good standing.






Statutory Accounting Principles

Our results are reported in accordance with GAAP, which differ in certain respects from amounts reported under statutory accounting principles (SAP) prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities. Certain
significant differences are described below:





CategoryGAAP AccountingSAP Accounting

Acquisition ExpensesCommissions, premium taxes, and other variable costs incurred in connection with writing new and renewal business are capitalized and amortized pro rata over the policy term as
premiums are earned.Commissions, premium taxes, and all other acquisition expenses are expensed as incurred.



Non-admitted AssetsPremium receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts.Premium receivables over 90 days past due are “non-admitted,” which means they are excluded from surplus. For premium receivables less than 90 days past due, we also
estimate a bad debt reserve.



Furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses are capitalized and amortized over their useful lives or periods benefited.Excluding computer equipment and operating software, the value of all other furniture, equipment, application software, leasehold improvements, and prepaid expenses, net of
accumulated depreciation or amortization, is non-admitted against surplus. Computer equipment and operating software are capitalized, subject to statutory limitations based on surplus, and depreciated over three years.



Deferred tax assets are recorded based on estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences. A valuation allowance would be recorded for any tax benefits that are
not expected to be realized.The accounting for deferred tax assets is consistent with GAAP, except for certain deferred tax assets that do not meet statutory requirements for recognition, which are
non-admitted against surplus.



ReinsuranceCeded reinsurance balances are shown as an asset on the balance sheet as “prepaid reinsurance premiums” and “reinsurance recoverables.”Ceded unearned premiums are netted against the “unearned premiums” liability. Ceded unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense (LAE) amounts are netted against “loss and
LAE reserves.” Only ceded paid loss and LAE are shown as a “reinsurance recoverables” asset.



Investment ValuationFixed-maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are reported at current fair values.Fixed-maturity securites are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the NAIC designation of the security.



Preferred stocks, both redeemable and nonredeemable, are reported at quoted fair values.Redeemable preferred stocks are reported at amortized cost or the lower of amortized cost or fair value, depending on the NAIC designation of the security. Nonredeemable preferred
stocks are reported at quoted fair value, consistent with GAAP.



Federal Income TaxesFederal tax expense and tax liability or recoverable balances include current and deferred income taxes.For income statement reporting, federal tax expense only includes the current tax provision. Deferred taxes are posted to surplus. SAP deferred tax assets are subject to certain
limitations on admissibility.

Investments

Our approach to investment and capital management seeks to ensure that we have sufficient capital to support all of the insurance premiums that we can profitably write. Our portfolio is invested primarily
in short-term and intermediate-term, investment-grade fixed-income securities. Our investment portfolio had a fair value of $15.5 billion at December 31, 2010, compared to $14.7 billion at December 31, 2009. Investment income is affected
by the variability of cash flows to or from the portfolio, shifts in the type and quality of investments in the portfolio, changes in yield, and other factors. Total investment income (loss), including net realized gains (losses) on securities,
before expenses and taxes, was $616.2 million in 2010, compared to $534.1 million in 2009 and $(807.4) million in 2008. For more detailed discussion, seeManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationsin our Annual Report, which is included as Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K.






Employees

The number of employees, excluding temporary employees, at December 31, 2010 was 24,638, all of whom were employed by subsidiaries of The Progressive Corporation.

Liability for Property-Casualty Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses

Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation

The following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending estimated liability balances for the last three years:

Our reserves developed favorably in both 2010 and 2009, compared to slight unfavorable development in 2008. Total
development consists of net changes made by our actuarial department on prior accident year reserves, based on regularly scheduled reviews, claims settling for more or less than reserved, emergence of unrecorded claims at rates different than
reserved, and changes in reserve estimates by claim representatives. The favorable development in 2010 was primarily attributable to lower than expected defense and cost containment expenses and favorable settlement on larger losses in both personal
auto and Commercial Auto. Similarly, in 2009, personal auto experienced lower than expected defense and cost containment costs, while Commercial Auto recognized favorable settlements on larger losses during the year. In 2008, an increase in the
number of late reported Commercial Auto claims, and an increase in the estimated severity of these claims, was a primary contributor to the unfavorable development.

In establishing loss reserves, we take into account projected changes in claim severity caused by anticipated inflation and a number of factors that vary with the individual type of policies written.
These severities are projected based on historical trends adjusted for anticipated changes in underwriting standards, inflation, policy provisions, claims resolution practices, and general economic trends. These anticipated trends are reconsidered
periodically based on actual development and are modified if necessary.

We have not entered into any loss reserve transfers or similar
transactions having a material effect on earnings or reserves.

The above table presents the development of balance sheet liabilities for losses and LAE from 2000 through
2009. The top line of the table shows the estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE recorded at the balance sheet date for each of the indicated years for the property-casualty insurance subsidiaries only. This liability represents the estimated
amount of losses and LAE for claims that were unpaid at the balance sheet date, including IBNR. The table also presents the re-estimated liability for unpaid losses and LAE on a gross and net basis, with separate disclosure of the re-estimated
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses.

The upper section of the table (labeled “Paid (Cumulative) as of:”) shows the cumulative
amount paid with respect to the previously recorded liability as of the end of each succeeding year. The lower portion of the table (labeled “Liability Re-estimated as of:”) shows the re-estimated amount of the previously recorded
liability based on experience as of the end of each succeeding year. The re-estimated amount is the sum of the paid amounts above and the outstanding reserve for occurrences prior to the reserve date. The estimate is increased or decreased as more
information about the claims becomes known for individual years. For example, as of December 31, 2010, our insurance subsidiaries had paid $2,970.6 million of the currently estimated $3,000.9 million of losses and LAE that had been unpaid at
the end of 2001; thus, an estimated $30.3 million of losses incurred through 2001 remain unpaid as of the current financial statement date.

The net cumulative development represents the aggregate change in the ultimate loss estimate over all prior years. For example, the 2000 liability has
developed favorably by $98.1 million over ten years. That amount has been reflected in income over the ten years and had the largest impact on the income in calendar year 2001. The effects on income during the past three years due to changes in
estimates of the liabilities for losses and LAE are shown in the reconciliation table on page 8 as the “prior years” contribution to incurred losses and LAE.

In evaluating this information, note that each cumulative development amount includes the effects of all changes in amounts during the current year for prior periods. For example, the amount of the
development related to losses settled in 2010, but incurred in 2007, will be included in the cumulative development amount for years 2007, 2008, and 2009. Conditions and trends that have affected development of the liability in the past may not
necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it generally is not appropriate to extrapolate future development based on this table.

For 2000
and 2001, while we experienced an increase in bodily injury severity, our developed reserves were within 2% to 4% of our original estimates. The bodily injury severity change was much lower than we expected between 2002 and 2005; thus, the reserve
run-off for these years was very favorable following the end of each year, or about 4% to 9% of our original carried amounts. The reserve development for each of 2006 through 2008 was less than 4% of our original carried reserves, while 2009
reserves developed favorably by about 5% due to lower than expected defense and cost containment expenses and favorable settlements on larger losses in our personal auto and Commercial Auto businesses.

Although the detail is not presented in the table on page 9, we also re-estimate the reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses each year. The top of the
table shows the amount of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses that we had at the end of the calendar year, while the bottom shows the reserves re-estimated based on development in subsequent years. For example, at December 31, 2009, we
estimated our reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to be $529.4 million. During 2010, these reserves developed unfavorably by $124.4 million, bringing the re-estimated reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses to $653.8 million, as shown at the
bottom of the table. Over the last ten years, we experienced unfavorable development in our reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses. This development primarily reflects our claims organization’s process of re-evaluating Michigan personal
injury protection claims that require lifetime reserve estimates, which began in 2009 and continued in early 2010. As a result, we increased both our direct reserves and corresponding reinsurance recoverables, since these claims are reinsured
through the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (MCCA) state-mandated plan. The MCCA is funded through an assessment that insurance companies collect from policyholders in the state; therefore, our exposure to losses from the failure of this
reinsurer is minimal.

The Analysis of Loss and Loss Adjustment Expenses Development table on page 9 is constructed from Schedule P, Part-1,
from the Consolidated Annual Statements of Progressive’s insurance subsidiaries, as filed with the state insurance departments.
