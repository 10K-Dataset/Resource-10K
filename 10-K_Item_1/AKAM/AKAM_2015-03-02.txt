Overview



Akamai provides cloud services for delivering, optimizing and securing online content and business applications. Our solutions range from delivery of conventional content on websites, to tools that support the delivery and operation of cloud-based applications, as well as security solutions and live and on-demand streaming video capabilities – all designed to help our customers interact with people accessing the Internet from a multitude of devices and locations around the world.  Forming the foundation of these solutions is the Akamai Intelligent Platform, which we believe is the world's largest globally-distributed computing platform, having over 170,000 servers deployed in more than 1,300 networks and over 100 countries around the world, tied together with sophisticated software and algorithms.  This platform enables us to constantly monitor Internet conditions to:



•identify, absorb, and block security threats;

•provide device-level detection and optimization;

•make routing and delivery decisions based on comprehensive knowledge of network conditions; and

•provide our customers with business and technical insights into their online operations.

Making the Cloud Work for our Customers



The Internet plays a crucial role in the way companies, government agencies and other enterprises conduct business and reach the public. Enterprises want to offer a dynamic, consistent, secure experience for millions of end users and to take advantage of the potential cost savings of cloud computing – using third party server facilities to enable Internet operations.  The Internet, however, is a complex system of networks that was not originally created to accommodate the volume or sophistication of today's communication demands or the dramatic expansion in the number and types of devices individuals use to access it.  The ad hoc architecture of the Internet presents potential problems for its widespread usage today, such as:



•traffic congestion at data centers and between networks;

•traffic exceeding the capacity of routing equipment;

•an absence of a coordinated security system to protect against hackers, bots and other malefactors that want to steal assets and disrupt the functioning of the web;

•growth in popularity of accessing streaming and other content over mobile networks, which tend to be slower and less reliable than the fixed line Internet; and

•“last mile” issues – such as bandwidth constraints between an end user and their Internet access provider.












These potential problems intersect with the features of what is sometimes referred to as the hyperconnected world, including:



•increasingly dynamic and personalized websites;

•growth in the transmission of rich content, including high definition, or HD, video, music and games;

•rapid expansion in the use of mobile devices leveraging different technologies and delivery systems; and

•the desire of millions of consumers worldwide to be able to enjoy the same high-quality experience across all of the devices they use.



Achieving an enterprise's goals in the face of these challenges is made more difficult by internal technology issues.  Driven by competition, globalization and expense-containment strategies, companies need an agile cloud-based infrastructure that cost-effectively meets real-time strategic and business objectives. The dramatic increase in Internet usage places extensive demands on infrastructure; however, expanding internal systems to meet even routine demand can be expensive.  Keeping pace with new developments can also be a difficult challenge.  Special marketing or promotional initiatives or unanticipated one-time events, such as important unanticipated news, may draw millions of additional visitors to a company's website over a brief period of time. Putting in place incremental internal infrastructure to deal with such spikes is usually impractical and cost-prohibitive.  Network operators themselves are challenged to profitably manage consumer access to the Internet over their networks; recouping the costs of the infrastructure build-outs they need to make is generally not supported by their traditional business models.



Akamai offers solutions to help companies, government agencies, network operators and other enterprises meet their goals in spite of the challenges at the intersection of the Internet and the hyperconnected world. We strive to make using the cloud a viable approach for customers by addressing the following market needs in an affordable way:



•Superior Performance. Commercial enterprises invest in websites to attract customers, transact business and provide information about the company.  Our solutions are designed to help enterprises improve the performance of their websites without the need for them to make the significant investment required to develop their own Internet-related infrastructure or develop ways to cope with the challenges and limitations of the Internet. With the Akamai Intelligent Platform, content and applications can be delivered from Akamai servers located closer to website visitors from what we call the “edge” of the Internet. We are thus able to reduce the impact of traffic congestion, bandwidth constraints and capacity limitations for our customers.  That translates into faster websites and applications.



•Scalability. With the proliferation of HD video and other types of rich content and the emergence of the Internet as a crucial sales channel, enterprises of all types must be able to handle rapidly increasing numbers of requests for bandwidth-intensive digital media assets. Websites must also be able to process millions of transactions, particularly during busy seasons.  Akamai takes a global approach to addressing the challenges of the Internet, and we believe the scale of our deployed network is key to this. In our view, we are uniquely able to handle today's traffic volumes as well as planned and unplanned traffic peaks, whether it is delivering worldwide sports events or handling the steady growth we have seen in online video consumption on a daily basis.



•Security.Internet-based security threats, such as viruses, worms, hactivists, information theft and other intrusions, can impact all aspects of performance, including information security, speed, reliability and customer confidence. Security is a key component of our technology platform, and our approach is designed to help organizations guard the perimeter of their networks and bolster security without sacrificing performance.  In recent years, including through the acquisition of Prolexic Technologies, or Prolexic, in 2014, we have expanded our offerings of security solutions for protecting our customers’ operations in the cloud.



•Functionality.Websites have become increasingly dynamic, complex and sophisticated. To meet these challenges, we offer an array of advanced features designed to help our customers accelerate dynamic content and applications, more effectively manage their online media assets, optimize how pages load on individual browsers and adapt content for mobile device access.

Competition



The market for our services is intensely competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent new product and service innovations. We expect competition for our services to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants. We compete primarily on the basis of:



•the performance and reliability of our services;

•return on investment in terms of cost savings and new revenue opportunities for our customers;

•reduced infrastructure complexity;

•sophistication and functionality of our offerings;

•scalability;

•security;

•ease of implementation and use of service;

•customer support; and

•price.



We compete with companies offering products and services that address Internet performance problems, including companies that provide Internet content delivery and hosting services, security solutions, technologies used by network operators to improve the efficiency of their systems, streaming content delivery services and equipment-based solutions for Internet performance problems, such as load balancers and server switches. Other companies offer online distribution of digital media assets through advertising-based billing or revenue-sharing models that may represent an alternative method for charging for the delivery of content and applications over the Internet. In addition, potential customers may decide to purchase or develop their own hardware, software or other technology solutions rather than rely on a provider of externally-managed services like Akamai.



We believe that we compete favorably with other companies in our industry through the global scale of the Akamai Intelligent Platform, which we believe provides the most effective means of meeting the needs of enterprise customers and is unique to us.  In our view, we also benefit from the superior quality of our offerings, our customer service, the information we can provide to our customers about their online operations and value.



Proprietary Rights and Licensing



Our success and ability to compete are dependent on our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions to protect the proprietary aspects of our technology. As ofDecember 31, 2014, we owned, or had exclusive rights to, 230 issued U.S. patents covering our technology as well as patents issued by other countries. We also have numerous additional U.S. and foreign country patent applications pending. Our U.S.-issued patents extend to various dates between 2015 and 2033. We do not believe that the expiration of any particular patent in the near future would be material to our business. In October 1998, we entered into a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, under which we were granted a royalty-free, worldwide exclusive right to use and sublicense the intellectual property rights of MIT under various patent applications and copyrights relating to Internet content delivery technology. We seek to limit disclosure of our intellectual property by requiring employees and consultants with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.



Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2014, we had5,105full-time and part-time employees. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified technical, managerial and other personnel for whom competition is intense. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit. We believe our relations with our employees are good, and we have been acknowledged in respected publications as an excellent place to work.
