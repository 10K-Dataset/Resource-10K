Strategy



The company focuses on four key long-term strategic objectives that are designed to sharpen our focus on client needs, further strengthen our business over time and help ensure our long-term success:



•Achieve strong, long-term investment performanceacross distinct investment capabilities with clearly articulated investment philosophies and processes, aligned with client needs;

•Be instrumental to our clients' successby delivering our distinctive investment capabilities worldwide to meet their needs;









•Harness the power of our global platformby continuously improving execution effectiveness to enhance quality and productivity, and allocating our resources to the opportunities that will best benefit clients and our business; and

•Perpetuate a high-performance organizationby driving greater transparency, accountability, diversity of thought, fact-based decision making and execution at all levels.



As an integrated global investment manager, we are keenly focused on meeting clients' needs and operating effectively and efficiently as an integrated, global organization.  We take a unified approach to our business and present our financial statements and other disclosures under the single operating segment “investment management.” See Item8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note17,"Geographic Information,” for a geographic breakdown of our consolidated operating revenues for the years endedDecember 31, 2017,2016and2015.



One of Invesco's great strengths is our separate, distinct investment teams in multiple markets across the globe. A key focus of our business is fostering a strong investment culture and providing the support that enables our investment teams to maintain well-performing investment capabilities. The ability to leverage the capabilities of our investment teams to help clients across the globe achieve their investment objectives is a significant differentiator for our firm.



2017 Developments



Throughout 2017, we continued to execute on our long-term strategic objectives, which further improved our ability to serve clients, strengthened our investment performance and helped us deliver competitive levels of operating income and margins. We also took advantage of opportunities in the market and further invested in our products and capabilities, our global platform and our people in ways that strengthened our business and further differentiated us in the marketplace to help ensure our long-term success.



Invesco achieved solid growth across our global business during 2017, supported by our strong, long-term investment performance, our comprehensive range of strategies and solutions and our robust client engagement efforts.  Our broadly diversified offering, combined with our strong investment performance, contributed to long-term AUM net inflows of$11.5 billionduring 2017. Also during 2017, we launched several new products and further invested in key parts of our business that will benefit our clients and enhance our competitiveness over the long term.  We continued to invest in capabilities where we see strong client demand or future opportunities by hiring world-class talent, upgrading our technology platform, launching new products and providing additional resources where necessary. The ability to leverage the capabilities developed by our investment teams to meet client demand across the globe is a significant differentiator for our firm, and we will continue to bring the best of Invesco to different parts of our business where it makes sense for our clients.  More specifically, in 2017 Invesco:



▪Further strengthened our investment culture, which enabled us to deliver strong, long-term investment performance to our clients across the globe, with64%and75%of measured actively managed ranked assets in the top half of peer groups* on a three- and five-year basis, respectively, as of December 31, 2017;

The acquisition will expand the depth, breadth and diversity of Invesco's traditional and smart beta ETFs, while providing additional scale and relevance in the growing ETF market globally.

Combined, these efforts helped us deliver better outcomes for clients while achieving further growth across our global business and further strengthening our competitive position. We continue to believe we are in the early stages of achieving the full potential of our global business.



Industry Trends



Trends around the world continue to transform the investment management industry and underscore the need to be well diversified with broad capabilities globally and across asset classes:

•Clients are demanding more from investment managers. While investment performance remains paramount, client engagement and value-added services (including portfolio analytics and providing consultative solutions) increasingly differentiate managers. Invesco is working to enhance the client's user experience through digital marketing (web, mobile, social) and improved service.

•Due to divergent central bank monetary policies between the U.S Federal Reserve and the central banks of other developed economies , investors are seeking outcome-orientated investment solutions that provide income and manage volatility. The building out of Invesco Solutions to respond to this trend is among the firm's top priorities.

•Investors are continuing to shift to alternative, passive, and smart beta strategies.  As a consequence, client demand for core equities and fixed income portfolios are declining as a share of global flows. Our PowerShares ETFs remain a leader in smart beta ETFs and Invesco has a strong lineup of alternative and multi-asset strategies supported by ongoing product development. Invesco expanded its broad range of ETF capabilities in 2017 with the acquisition of a leading, independent, diversified, at-scale ETF provider in Europe, and the planned acquisition of Guggenheim Investments’ ETF business, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018. By expanding the depth, breadth and diversity of Invesco’s traditional and smart beta ETFs, the planned Guggenheim Investments’ ETF business acquisition will significantly enhance our ability to deliver meaningful solutions to institutional and retail clients across the globe.









•We are seeing increased pressure on pricing within the asset management industry, arising from further concentration within our channel distribution partners (which increases their ability to negotiate pricing) and additional regulatory scrutiny on industry fees.

•Distribution partners are becoming more selective and are moving towards developing fewer relationships and partners, reducing the number of investment managers with whom they work, especially in the U.S. driven by the rules adopted by the Department of Labor.

•Regulatory activity remains at increased levels and is influencing competitive dynamics.  Increased regulatory scrutiny of managers has focused on many areas including transparency/unbundling of fees, inducements, conflicts of interest, capital, liquidity, solvency, leverage, operational risk management, controls and compensation.  Invesco continues to proactively work with regulators around the world.  Efforts to further modernize and strengthen our global platform will enhance our ability to compete effectively across markets while complying with the variety of applicable regulatory regimes.

•Although the developed markets in the U.S. and Europe are currently the two largest markets for financial assets by a wide margin, other key emerging markets in the world, such as China and India, are positioned for future growth despite near-term headwinds. As these population-heavy markets mature, we believe investment managers that are truly global will be in the best position to capture this growth. Additionally, population age differences between emerging and developed markets will result in differing investment needs and horizons among countries. Asset allocation and retirement savings schemes also differ substantially among countries. We believe firms such as Invesco, with diversified investment capabilities and product types, are best positioned to meet clients' needs in this global competitive landscape. Invesco has a meaningful market presence in many of the world's most attractive regions, including North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. We believe our strong and growing presence in established and emerging markets provides significant long-term growth potential for our business.

•Technology advances are impacting core elements of the investment management industry which lags other industries in its use of technology. Clients increasingly seek to interact digitally with their investment portfolios.  This is leading to established managers investing in and/or acquiring "robo" platforms. As the investment management business becomes more complex, automation will become increasingly important to serve clients effectively and efficiently. Invesco is leveraging technology in all aspects of its business and exploring opportunities to work with third-party technology firms to enhance our clients' investment experience. This includes the addition of Jemstep, our advisor-powered digital advice capability, to offer digital advice as a means for strengthening existing client relationships by offering a comprehensive wealth management service.



As a result of the trends discussed above, there are increased signs of a maturing industry in which consolidation is likely to occur.  We believe Invesco is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities created by these global industry trends. Our comprehensive range of investment capabilities and broad diversification enable us to continue meeting client needs and strengthen our competitive position through a variety of economic and market environments. Our multi-year strategic objectives are designed to leverage our global presence, our distinctive investment capabilities and our talented people to help us meet client needs.  We believe firmly that if we help clients achieve their investment objectives and manage our business effectively and efficiently, we can further grow our business and deliver strong results to shareholders over the long term.



Investment Management Capabilities



Supported by a global platform, Invesco delivers a comprehensive array of investment capabilities and services to retail and institutional investors. We have a significant presence in the retail and institutional markets within the investment management industry in North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, serving clients in more than150countries.



We believe that the proven strength of our distinct and globally located investment teams and their well-defined investment disciplines and risk management approach provide us with a robust competitive advantage. There are few independent investment managers with teams as globally diverse as Invesco's and with the same breadth and depth of investment capabilities and vehicles. We offer multiple investment objectives within the various asset classes and products that we manage. Our asset classes, broadly defined, include money market, balanced, equity, fixed income and alternatives.

Distribution Channels



Retail AUM originates from clients investing into funds available to the public in the form of shares or units. Institutional AUM originates from entities such as individual corporate clients, insurance companies, endowments, foundations, government authorities, universities or charities.  AUM disclosure by distribution channel represents consolidated AUM distributed by type of sales team (the company's internal distribution channels). AUM amounts disclosed as retail channel AUM represents AUM distributed by the company's retail sales team; whereas AUM amounts disclosed as institutional channel AUM represents AUM distributed by the company's institutional sales team.



The company operates as an integrated global investment manager, presenting itself as a single firm to clients around the world. This is supported with the cross-selling of investment capabilities globally and an integrated internal sales force.  As a result, the company's retail and institutional sales forces are able to sell products that cross over traditional delineations of retail or institutional vehicle types. Therefore, not all products sold in the disclosed retail distribution channel are "retail" products, and not all products sold in the disclosed institutional channel are "institutional" products. This aggregation, however, is viewed as a proxy for presenting AUM in the retail and institutional markets in which we operate.



The following lists our primary investment vehicles by distribution channel:



RetailInstitutional● Closed-end Mutual Funds● Collective Trust Funds● Exchange-traded Funds (ETF)● Exchange-traded Funds (ETF)● Individual Savings Accounts (ISA)● Institutional Separate Accounts● Investment Companies with Variable Capital (ICVC)● Open-end Mutual Funds● Société d'investissement à Capital Variable (SICAV)● Private Capital Funds● Investment Trusts● Open-end Mutual Funds● Separately Managed Accounts (SMA)● Unit Investment Trusts (UIT)● Variable Insurance Funds











Retail



Invesco is a significant provider of retail investment solutions to clients in all major markets including North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Retail AUM was$637.0 billionatDecember 31, 2017. We offer retail products within all of the major asset classes. Our retail products are primarily distributed through third-party financial intermediaries, including major wire houses, fund supermarkets, regional broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks and financial planners in North America, and independent brokers and financial advisors, banks and supermarket platforms in Europe and Asia.



The U.K., North American and Continental European retail operations rank among the largest by AUM in their respective markets. As ofDecember 31, 2017, Invesco Perpetual was the largest retail fund provider in the U.K.; Invesco's U.S. retail business, including our PowerShares ETF franchise, was among the 10 largest non-proprietary fund complexes in the U.S. by long-term assets and Invesco in Continental Europe was among the largest non-proprietary investment managers in the retail channel. Invesco Great Wall, our joint venture in China, was one of the largest Sino-foreign managers of equity products in China, with AUM of approximately$17.4 billionas ofDecember 31, 2017. We provide our retail clients with one of the industry's most robust and comprehensive product lines.



Institutional



We provide investment solutions to institutional investors globally, with a major presence in North America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific. Institutional AUM was$300.6 billionin AUM as ofDecember 31, 2017. We offer a broad suite of domestic and global strategies, including traditional and quantitative equities, fixed income (including money market funds for institutional clients), real estate, private equity, financial structures and absolute return strategies. Regional sales forces distribute our products and provide services to clients and intermediaries around the world. We have a diversified client base that includes major public entities, corporations, unions, non-profit organizations, endowments, foundations, pension funds, financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds. Invesco's institutional money market funds serve some of the largest financial institutions, government entities and corporations in the world.



AUM Diversification



One of Invesco's greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset class. Our distribution network has attracted assets of68%retail and32%institutional as ofDecember 31, 2017. By client domicile,38%of client AUM are outside the U.S., and we serve clients in more than150countries. The following tables present a breakdown of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset class as ofDecember 31, 2017. Additionally, the fourth table below illustrates the split of our AUM as Passive and Active.Passive AUM includes ETFs, unit investment trusts (UITs), certain non-fee earning leverage and other passive mandates.Active AUM is total AUM less Passive AUM.

Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2017, the company had7,030employees across the globe. As ofDecember 31, 2016and2015, we had6,790and6,490employees, respectively. None of our employees is covered under collective bargaining agreements.



Competition



The investment management business is highly competitive, with points of differentiation including investment performance, the range of products offered, brand recognition, business reputation, financial strength, the depth and continuity of relationships, quality of service and the level of fees charged for services. We compete with a large number of investment management firms, commercial banks, investment banks, broker dealers, hedge funds, insurance companies and other financial institutions. We believe that the quality and diversity of our investment capabilities, product types and channels of distribution enable us to compete effectively in the investment management business. We also believe being an independent investment manager is a competitive advantage, as our business model avoids conflicts that are inherent within institutions that both manage and distribute and/or service those products. Lastly, we believe continued execution against our multi-year strategic objectives will further strengthen our long-term competitive position.



Management Contracts



We derive substantially all of our revenues from investment management contracts with funds and other clients. Fees vary with the type of assets being managed, with higher fees earned on actively managed equity and balanced accounts, along with real estate and other alternative asset products, and lower fees earned on fixed income, money market and stable value accounts, as well as certain ETFs. Investment management contracts are generally terminable upon thirty or fewer days' notice. Typically, retail investors may withdraw their funds at any time without prior notice. Institutional clients may elect to terminate their relationship with us or reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management with very short notice periods.



Risk Management



Invesco is committed to continually strengthening and refining our risk management approach. We believe a key factor in Invesco's ability to manage through all market cycles is our integrated approach to risk management.  Invesco's enterprise risk management approach is embedded in its management decision-making and processes across the organization and provides the basis for consistent and meaningful risk dialogue up, down and across the company. Broadly, our approach includes two governance structures - one for investments and another for business and operational risks with coordination between the two.



•Investment risk oversight is supported by the Global Performance Measurement and Risk group, which provides senior management and the Board with insight into core investment risks.

•Business and operational risk oversight is supported by the Corporate Risk Management Committee, which facilitates a focus on strategic, operational and other key business risks both existing and emerging, as well as appropriate ongoing management and Board oversight.



Further, a network of functional, geographic and specific risk management committees under the guidance and standards of the Corporate Risk Management Committee maintain ongoing risk assessment, management and monitoring processes that provide a bottom-up perspective on the specific risk areas existing in various domains of our business.
