ITEM 1. BUSINESS

General

We are a leading
independent owner and operator of wireless communications towers. Our principal operations are in the United States and its territories. In addition, we own and operate towers in Canada, Central America and South America. Our primary business line
is our site leasing business, which contributed 97.4% of our total segment operating profit for the year ended December 31, 2012. In our site leasing business, we lease antenna space primarily to wireless service providers on towers and other
structures that we own, manage or lease from others. The towers that we own have been constructed by us at the request of a wireless service provider, built or constructed based on our own initiative or acquired. As of December 31, 2012, we
owned 17,491 tower sites, the majority of which have been built by us or built by other tower owners or operators who, like us, have built such towers to lease space to multiple wireless service providers. We also managed or leased approximately
4,800 actual or potential communications sites, approximately 500 of which were revenue producing as of December 31, 2012. Our other business line is our site development business, through which we assist wireless service providers in
developing and maintaining their own wireless service networks.

Site Leasing Services

Our primary focus is the leasing of antenna space on our multi-tenant towers to a variety of wireless service providers under long-term
lease contracts in the United States, Canada, Central America and South America. Site leasing revenues are received primarily from wireless service provider tenants, including AT&T, Sprint, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Digicel, Claro, and
Telefonica. Wireless service providers enter into numerous different tenant leases with us, each of which relates to the lease or use of space at an individual tower site. In the United States and Canada our tenant leases are generally for an
initial term of five to ten years with five 5-year renewal periods at the option of the tenant. These tenant leases typically contain specific rent escalators, which average 3-4% per year, including the renewal option periods. Tenant leases in
our Central and South America markets typically have an initial term of 10 years with 5-year renewal periods. In Central America, we have similar rent escalators to that of leases in the United States and Canada while our leases in South America
typically escalate in accordance with a standard cost of living index.

We expand our tower portfolio, both domestically and
internationally, through the construction of new towers, or new builds, and through the acquisition of towers from third parties. In our new build program, we construct towers in locations that were strategically chosen by us or under build-to-suit
arrangements. Under build-to-suit arrangements, we build towers for wireless service providers at locations that they have identified. We retain ownership of the tower and the exclusive right to co-locate additional tenants on the tower. When we
construct towers in locations chosen by us, we utilize our knowledge of our customers’ network requirements to identify locations where we believe multiple wireless service providers need, or will need, to locate antennas to meet capacity or
service demands. We seek to identify attractive locations for new towers and complete pre-construction procedures necessary to secure the site concurrently with our leasing efforts. We generally will have at least one signed tenant lease for each
new build tower on the day that it is completed and expect that some will have multiple tenants. During 2013, we intend to build between 380 and 400 new towers, domestically and internationally.

In our tower acquisition program, we pursue towers that meet or exceed our internal guidelines regarding current and future potential
returns. For each acquisition, we prepare various analyses that include projections of a five-year unlevered internal rate of return, review of available capacity, future lease up projections and a summary of current and future tenant/technology
mix.







The table below provides information regarding the development and status of our tower
portfolio over the past three years.

(1)Reclassifications reflect the combination for reporting purposes of multiple tower structures on a single parcel of real estate, which we market and customers view as a
single location, into a single owned tower site. Dispositions reflect the decommissioning, sale, conveyance or other legal transfer of owned tower sites.

As of December 31, 2012, we had an average of 2.0 tenants per tower.

Our
site leasing business generates substantially all of our total segment operating profit. Our site leasing business generated 88.7% of our total revenues during the year ended December 31, 2012 and has represented 97.4% or more of our total
segment operating profit for the past three years. For the year ended December 31, 2012, site leasing revenues generated outside the U.S. and its territories was less than 6% of total revenue.

International Operations

In 2012, we continued to focus on growing our international operations, including the acquisition of 800 towers in Brazil. We believe that
we can create substantial value by expanding our site leasing services into select international markets which we believe have a high-growth wireless industry and relatively stable political and regulatory environments. At December 31, 2012, we
owned 2,562 towers in Brazil, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Panama, and intend to continue expanding in these and other international markets. The majority of these international markets typically have less mature
wireless networks with limited wireline infrastructure and wireless data penetration. Accordingly, our expansion in these markets is primarily driven by (i) wireless service providers seeking to increase the quality and coverage of their
networks, (ii) consumers’ increased use of high data applications, such as email, internet access and video, and (iii) incremental spectrum auctions, which have resulted in new market entrants, as well as incremental voice and data
network deployments. For example, we have had a meaningful build-out of our new towers and communication sites in Costa Rica as a result of spectrum auctions in that country. We expect to continue expanding internationally through buying or building
towers, managing communication sites and leasing space to wireless service providers on assets we control.

We consider various factors when
identifying a market for our international expansion, including:



•Country analysis– We consider the country’s political stability, and whether the country’s general business, legal and
regulatory environment is conducive to the sustainability and growth of our business.



•Market potential– We analyze the expected demand for wireless services, and whether a country has multiple wireless service providers who
are actively seeking to invest in deploying voice and data networks, as well as spectrum auctions that have occurred or that are anticipated to occur.



•Risk adjusted return criteria– We consider whether buying or building towers in a country, and providing our management and leasing
services, will meet our return criteria. As part of this analysis, we consider the risk of entering into an international market, and how our expansion meets our long-term strategic objectives for the region and our business generally.







Site Development Services

Our site development business, which is conducted in the United States only, is complementary to our site leasing business and provides us the ability to keep in close contact with the wireless service
providers who generate substantially all of our site leasing revenue and to capture ancillary revenues that are generated by our site leasing activities, such as antenna and equipment installation at our tower locations. Site development services
revenues are received primarily from providing a full range of end to end services to wireless service providers or companies providing development or project management services to wireless service providers. Our services include: (1) network
pre-design; (2) site audits; (3) identification of potential locations for towers and antennas; (4) support in buying or leasing of the location; (5) assistance in obtaining zoning approvals and permits; (6) tower and
related site construction; (7) antenna installation; and (8) radio equipment installation, commissioning and maintenance.

We provide our site development services on a local basis, through regional offices, territory offices and project offices. The regional offices are responsible for all site development operations,
including hiring employees and opening or closing project offices, and a substantial portion of the sales in such area.

For
financial information about our operating segments, please see Note 21 of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.

Industry Developments

We believe that growing wireless traffic (particularly data and video), the deployment of additional spectrum, and technology advancements
will require wireless service providers to improve their network infrastructure and increase their network capacity resulting in an increase in the number of communication sites that they use or the number of antennas at existing communication
sites. The following is a discussion of certain growth trends in the wireless communications industry:



•As wireless data usage grows rapidly, all four U.S. nationwide carriers are deploying new and upgraded networks and we believe that the continued
deployment of 4G wireless technologies, such as LTE, will require our customers to add large numbers of additional cell sites and additional equipment at current cell sites.



•We have seen, and anticipate there could be other, new entrants into the wireless communications industry that could deploy regional or national
wireless networks for voice and data services.



•Spectrum licensed by the Federal Communications Commission in 2006 and 2008 has enabled continued network development, and we expect this and the
potential availability of additional spectrum should enable continued network development in the U.S. In August 2012, Verizon received regulatory approval to purchase spectrum originally auctioned in 2006 to SpectrumCo, a joint venture of cable
companies. Also, in December, 2012, Dish Networks received regulatory approval to terrestrially deploy certain of its spectrum that was previously limited for use in satellite based networks.



•Consumers are increasing their use of wireless data services due to expansion of wireless data applications, such as email, web browsing, social
networking, music and video, and continued wireline to wireless migration. Wireless devices are trending toward more bandwidth intensive devices such as smartphones, laptops, netbooks, tablets and other emerging and embedded devices. As a result,
management believes that North American mobile data traffic will grow at an approximately 56% compound annual growth rate from 2012 to 2017.



•Consumers list network coverage and quality as two of the greatest contributors to their dissatisfaction when terminating or changing service. To
decrease subscriber churn rate and drive revenue growth, wireless carriers have made substantial capital expenditures on wireless networks to improve service quality and expand coverage. For example, U.S. wireless carriers’ capital expenditures
have increased from an estimated $19.9 billion in 2009 to an estimated $28.6 billion in 2012, and we expect capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to remain elevated as wireless carriers continue to improve their networks.







Despite the recent economic challenges affecting the global marketplace, based on these
factors, we believe that the world-wide wireless industry will continue to grow and is well-capitalized, highly competitive and focused on quality and advanced services. Therefore, we expect that we will see a multi-year trend of strong additional
cell site demand from our customers, which we believe will translate into strong leasing growth for us.

Business Strategy

Our primary strategy is to continue to focus on expanding our site leasing business due to its attractive characteristics such as
long-term contracts, built-in rent escalators, high operating margins and low customer churn. The long-term nature of the revenue stream of our site leasing business makes it less volatile than our site development business, which is more cyclical.
By focusing on our site leasing business, we believe that we can maintain a stable, recurring cash flow stream and reduce our exposure to cyclical changes in customer spending. Key elements of our strategy include:

Maximizing Use of Tower Capacity.We generally have constructed or acquired towers that accommodate multiple tenants and a
majority of our towers are high capacity towers. Most of our towers have significant capacity available for additional antennas and we believe that increased use of our towers can be achieved at a low incremental cost. We actively market space on
our towers through our internal sales force.

Disciplined Growth of our Tower Portfolio.We believe that our
tower operations are highly scalable. Consequently, we believe that we are able to materially increase our tower portfolio without proportionately increasing selling, general and administrative expenses. During 2013, we intend to continue to grow
our tower portfolio, domestically and internationally, by 5% to 10%; through tower acquisitions and the construction of new towers. In connection with our international expansion, we have targeted select international markets that we believe have
relatively stable political environments and a growing wireless communication industry. We intend to use our available cash from operating activities and available liquidity, including borrowings, to build and/or acquire new towers at prices that we
believe will be accretive to our shareholders both in the short and long term and which allow us to maintain our long-term target leverage ratios.

Capitalizing on our Scale and Management Experience.We are a large owner, operator and developer of tower and other communication sites, with substantial capital, human and operating resources. We
have been developing communication sites for wireless service providers in the U.S. since 1989 and owned and operated tower sites for ourselves since 1997. We believe our size, experience, capabilities and resources make us a preferred partner for
wireless service providers both in the U.S. and internationally. Our management team has extensive experience in site leasing and site development, with some of the longest tenures in the tower and site development industries. Management believes
that its industry expertise and strong relationships with wireless service providers will allow us to expand our position as a leading provider of site leasing and site development services.

Controlling our Underlying Land Positions. We have purchased and intend to continue to purchase and/or enter into perpetual
easements or long-term leases for the land that underlies our towers, to the extent available at commercially







reasonable prices. We believe that these purchases, perpetual easements, and/or long-term leases will increase our margins, improve our cash flow from operations and minimize our exposure to
increases in ground lease rents in the future. For the quarter ended December 31, 2012, approximately 70% of our tower sites were located on land that we own or control for more than 20 years and the average remaining life under our ground
leases, including renewal options under our control, was 31 years. As of December 31, 2012, approximately 6.1% of our tower sites have ground leases maturing in the next 10 years.

Using our Local Presence to Build Strong Relationships with Major Wireless Service Providers.Given the nature of towers as
location specific communications facilities, we believe that substantially all of what we do is done best locally. Consequently, we have a broad field organization that allows us to develop and capitalize on our experience, expertise and
relationships in each of our local markets which in turn enhances our customer relationships. We are seeking to replicate this operating model internationally. Due to our presence in local markets, we believe we are well positioned to capture
additional site leasing business and new tower build opportunities in our markets and identify and participate in site development projects across our markets.

Customers

Since commencing operations, we have performed site leasing and
site development services for all of the large U.S. wireless service providers. In both our site leasing and site development businesses, we work with large national providers and smaller regional, local or private operators.

We depend on a relatively small number of customers for our site leasing and site development revenues. The following customers
represented at least 10% of our total revenues during the last three years:

Sales and Marketing

Our sales and marketing goals are to:



•use existing relationships and develop new relationships with wireless service providers to lease antenna space on and sell related services with
respect to our owned or managed towers, enabling us to grow our site leasing business; and



•successfully bid and win those site development services contracts that will contribute to our operating margins and/or provide a financial or
strategic benefit to our site leasing business.

We approach sales on a company-wide basis, involving many
of our employees. We have a dedicated sales force that is supplemented by members of our executive management team. Our dedicated salespeople are based regionally as well as in the corporate office. We also rely on our vice presidents, general
managers and other operations personnel to sell our services and cultivate customers. Our strategy is to delegate sales efforts to those employees of ours who have the best relationships with our customers. Most wireless service providers have
national corporate headquarters with regional and local offices. We believe that wireless service providers make most decisions for site development and site leasing services at the regional and local levels with input from their corporate
headquarters. Our sales representatives work with wireless service provider representatives at the regional and local levels and at the national level when appropriate. Our sales staff compensation is heavily weighted to incentive-based goals and
measurements.

Competition

Site Leasing

Site
Development– The site development business is extremely competitive and price sensitive. We believe that the majority of our competitors in the U.S. site development business operate within local market areas exclusively, while some firms
offer their services nationally. The market includes participants from a variety of market segments offering individual, or combinations of, competing services. The field of competitors includes site development consultants, zoning consultants, real
estate firms, right-of-way consulting firms, construction companies, tower owners/managers, radio frequency engineering consultants, telecommunications equipment vendors, which provide end-to-end site development services through multiple
subcontractors, and wireless service providers’ internal staff. We believe that providers base their decisions for site development services on a number of criteria, including: company experience, price, track record, local reputation,
geographic reach and time for completion of a project.







Employees

Our executive, corporate development, accounting, finance, human resources, legal and regulatory, information technology and site administration personnel, and our network operations center, are located
in our headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida. Certain sales, new tower build support and tower maintenance personnel are also located in our Boca Raton office. Our remaining employees are based in our international, regional, and local offices.

As of December 31, 2012, we had 1,022 employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Of
these 1,022 employees, 103 were based outside of the U.S. and its territories. We consider our employee relations to be good.

Regulatory
and Environmental Matters

Federal Regulations.In the U.S., which accounted for 94.3% of our total site leasing
revenue for the year ended December 31, 2012, both the FCC and the Federal Aviation Administration (the “FAA”) regulate antenna towers and structures that support wireless communications and radio or television antennas. Many FAA
requirements are implemented in FCC regulations. These regulations govern the construction, lighting and painting or other marking of towers and structures, as well as the maintenance, inspection, and record keeping related to towers and structures,
and may, depending on the characteristics of particular towers or structures, require prior approval and registration of towers or structures before they may be constructed, altered or used. Wireless communications equipment and radio or television
stations operating on towers or structures are separately regulated and may require independent customer licensing depending upon the particular frequency or frequency band used. In addition, any applicant for an FCC antenna tower or structure
registration must certify that, consistent with the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, neither the applicant nor its principals are subject to a denial of Federal benefits because of a conviction for the possession or distribution of a controlled
substance.

Pursuant to the requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, the FCC, in conjunction with the FAA,
has developed standards to consider proposals involving new or modified antenna towers or structures. These standards mandate that the FCC and the FAA consider the height of the proposed tower or structure, the relationship of the tower or structure
to existing natural or man-made obstructions and the proximity of the tower or structure to runways and airports. Proposals to construct or to modify existing towers or structures above certain heights must be reviewed by the FAA to ensure the
structure will not present a hazard to air navigation. The FAA may condition its issuance of a no-hazard determination upon compliance with specified lighting and/or painting requirements. Antenna towers that meet certain height and location
criteria must also be registered with the FCC. A tower or structure that requires FAA clearance will not be registered by the FCC until it is cleared by the FAA. Upon registration, the FCC may also require special lighting and/or painting. Owners of
wireless communications antenna towers and structures may have an obligation to maintain painting and lighting or other marking in conformance with FAA and FCC regulations. Antenna tower and structure owners and licensees that operate on those
towers or structures also bear the responsibility of monitoring any lighting systems and notifying the FAA of any lighting outage or malfunction.

Owners and operators of antenna towers and structures may be subject to, and therefore must comply with, environmental laws. Any licensed radio facility on an antenna tower or structure is subject to
environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, among other statutes, which requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of their decisions under certain circumstances. The FCC has issued regulations
implementing the National Environmental Policy Act. These regulations place responsibility on applicants to investigate potential environmental effects of their operations and to disclose any potential







significant effects on the environment in an environmental assessment prior to constructing or modifying an antenna tower or structure and prior to commencing certain operations of wireless
communications or radio or television stations from the tower or structure. In the event the FCC determines the proposed structure or operation would have a significant environmental impact based on the standards the FCC has developed, the FCC would
be required to prepare an environmental impact statement, which will be subject to public comment. This process could significantly delay the registration of a particular tower or structure.

We generally indemnify our customers against any failure to comply with applicable regulatory standards relating to the construction,
modification, or placement of antenna towers or structures. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements may lead to civil penalties.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 amended the Communications Act of 1934 by preserving state and local zoning authorities’ jurisdiction over the construction, modification and placement of towers.
The law, however, limits local zoning authority by prohibiting any action that would discriminate among different providers of personal wireless services or ban altogether the construction, modification or placement of radio communication towers.
Finally, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 requires the federal government to help licensees for wireless communications services gain access to preferred sites for their facilities. This may require that federal agencies and departments work
directly with licensees to make federal property available for tower facilities.

As an owner and operator of real property,
we are subject to certain environmental laws that impose strict, joint and several liability for the cleanup of on-site or off-site contamination and related personal or property damage. We are also subject to certain environmental laws that govern
tower or structure placement, including pre-construction environmental studies. Operators of towers or structures must also take into consideration certain radio frequency (“RF”) emissions regulations that impose a variety of procedural
and operating requirements. Certain proposals to operate wireless communications and radio or television stations from antenna towers and structures are also reviewed by the FCC to ensure compliance with requirements relating to human exposure to RF
emissions. Exposure to high levels of RF energy can produce negative health effects. The potential connection between low-level RF energy and certain negative health effects, including some forms of cancer, has been the subject of substantial study
by the scientific community in recent years. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with and we have no material liability under any applicable environmental laws. These costs of compliance with existing or future environmental laws and
liability related thereto may have a material adverse effect on our prospects, financial condition or results of operations.

State and Local Regulations.Most states regulate certain aspects of real estate acquisition, leasing activities and construction
activities. Where required, we conduct the site acquisition portions of our site development services business through licensed real estate brokers’ agents, who may be our employees or hired as independent contractors, and conduct the
construction portions of our site development services through licensed contractors, who may be our employees or independent contractors. Local regulations include city and other local ordinances, zoning restrictions and restrictive covenants
imposed by community developers. These regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but typically require tower and structure owners to obtain approval from local officials or community standards organizations, or certain other
entities prior to tower or structure construction and establish regulations regarding maintenance and removal of towers or structures. In addition, many local zoning authorities require tower and structure owners to post bonds or cash collateral to
secure their removal obligations. Local zoning authorities generally have been unreceptive to construction of new antenna towers and structures in their communities because of the height and visibility of the towers or structures, and have, in some
instances, instituted moratoria.

International. Regulatory regimes outside of the U.S. and its territories vary by
country and locality, however these regulations typically require tower owners and/or licensees to obtain approval from local officials or government agencies prior to tower construction or modification or the addition of a new antenna to an
existing







tower. Additionally, some regulations include ongoing obligations regarding painting, lighting, and maintenance. Our international operations may also be subject to limitations on foreign
ownership of land in certain areas. Based on our experience to date, these regimes have been similar to, but not more rigorous, burdensome or comprehensive than, those in the U.S. Non-compliance with such regulations may lead to monetary penalties
or deconstruction orders. Our international operations are also subject to various regulations and guidelines regarding employee relations and other occupational health and safety matters. As we expand our operations into additional international
geographic areas, we will be subject to regulations in these jurisdictions.

Backlog

Backlog related to our site leasing business consists of lease agreements and amendments, which have been signed, but have not yet
commenced. As of December 31, 2012, excluding the Sprint Network Vision Amendment, we had 1,052 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases and amendments will
contractually provide for approximately $8.1 million of annual revenue. By comparison, as of December 31, 2011, we had 251 new leases and amendments which had been executed with customers but which had not begun generating revenue. These leases
and amendments contractually provided for approximately $5.1 million of annual revenue.

Our backlog for site development
services consists of the value of work that has not yet been completed on executed contracts. As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $45.9 million of contractually committed revenue as compared to approximately $14.5 million as of
December 31, 2011.
