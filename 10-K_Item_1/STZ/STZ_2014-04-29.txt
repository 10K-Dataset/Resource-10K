Item 1.  Business.



Introduction



We are a leading international beverage alcohol company with many of our products recognized as leaders in their respective categories and geographic markets.  We are the third-largest producer and marketer of beer for the U.S. market and the world’s leading premium wine company with a leading market position in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand.  Our wine portfolio is complemented by select premium spirits brands and other select beverage alcohol products.  We are the largest multi-category supplier (beer, wine and spirits) (“Multi-category Supplier”) of beverage alcohol in the U.S.  Our strong market positions make us a supplier of choice to many of our customers, who include wholesale distributors, retailers, on-premise locations and government alcohol beverage control agencies.



The Company is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 4, 1972, as the successor to a business founded in 1945.  We have approximately6,300employees located primarily in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, with our corporate headquarters located in Victor, New York.  We conduct our business through entities we wholly own as well as through a variety of joint ventures and other entities.



Strategy



Certain key industry trends during the past decade have impacted our activities, results and strategy.  These include:

•consolidation of suppliers, wholesalers and retailers;

•high-end beer (imports and crafts) growing faster than domestic beer in the U.S.;

•an increase in global wine consumption, with premium wines growing faster than value-priced wines; and

•volume of premium spirits growing faster than value-priced spirits in the U.S.



To capitalize on these trends, become more competitive and grow our business, we have generally employed a strategy focused on a combination of organic growth and acquisitions, with an increasing focus on the higher-margin premium categories of the beverage alcohol industry.  Key elements of our strategy include:



•leveraging our existing portfolio of leading brands;

•developing new products, new packaging and line extensions;

•strengthening relationships with wholesalers and retailers;

•expanding distribution of our product portfolio;

•enhancing production capabilities;

•realizing operating efficiencies and synergies; and

•maximizing asset utilization.



We have complemented this strategy by divesting certain businesses, brands and assets as part of our efforts to increase the mix of premium brands, improve margins, create operating efficiencies and reduce debt.  Further, we have acquired higher-margin premium wine growth brands, and we have completed the Beer Business Acquisition to solidify our position in the U.S. beer market over the long-term; diversify our profit base and enhance our margins, earnings and cash flow; and provide new avenues for growth.



For further information on our strategy, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“MD&A”).











Acquisitions and Divestitures



As part of our strategy to improve margins, enhance production capabilities and keep an increased focus on the higher-margin premium categories of the beverage alcohol industry, we have made the following acquisitions and divestitures:

NamePeriodBeer Business AcquisitionJune 2013Mark West acquisitionJuly 2012Ruffino acquisitionOctober 2011CWAE DivestitureJanuary 2011



Beer Business Acquisition



The acquisition of Modelo’s U.S. beer business included the remaining 50% interest in Crown Imports, which provides us with complete, independent control of our U.S. commercial beer business; a state-of-the-art Brewery in Mexico; and exclusive perpetual brand rights to import, market and sell Corona and the other Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. market.  The transaction solidifies our position in the U.S. beer market for the long term and makes us the third-largest brewer and seller of beer for the U.S. market.  Combining this with our strong position in wine and spirits positions us as the largest Multi-category Supplier of beverage alcohol in the U.S.



Mark West



The acquisition of this higher-margin, premium wine growth brand has complemented our existing portfolio and further strengthened our position in the U.S. Pinot Noir category.



Ruffino



The acquisition of the remaining equity interest in this business has solidified our position in the Italian premium wine category in the U.S. and Canada.



CWAE Divestiture



Consistent with our strategic focus on premiumizing our portfolio and improving our margins and return on invested capital, we sold 80.1% of our Australian and U.K. business in January 2011 (the “CWAE Divestiture”).



For further information about our Fiscal 2014, Fiscal 2013 and Fiscal 2012 transactions, see (i)  MD&A and (ii)  Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Notes to the Financial Statements”).











Business Segments



We report our operating results in three segments:  (i)  Beer (formerly Crown Imports), (ii)  Wine and Spirits (formerly Constellation Wines and Spirits) and (iii)  Corporate Operations and Other.  The business segments reflect how our operations are managed, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.  We report net sales in two reportable segments, as follows:

Beer



In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition and the resulting consolidation of the acquired businesses as of June 2013, the Crown Imports segment, together with the Brewery Purchase, is now known as the Beer segment.  We have the exclusive right to import, market and sell these Mexican Beer Brands in all 50 states of the U.S.:



•Corona Extra

•Corona Light

•Modelo Especial

•Pacifico

•Negra Modelo

•Victoria



In the U.S., we have five of the top-selling 15 imported beer brands.  Corona Extra is the best-selling imported beer and the fifth best-selling beer overall in the U.S.; Corona Light is the leading imported light beer; and Modelo Especial is the third-largest and one of the fastest-growing major imported beer brands.  During Fiscal 2014, we introduced Modelo Especial Chelada, a blend of Modelo Especial with flavors of tomato, salt and lime, to further capitalize on the strength of this growing brand.



The current capacity of our Brewery is 10 million hectoliters.  We intend to expand the Brewery’s capacity to 20 million hectoliters so it can produce all of our anticipated Mexican beer supply requirements.  The Brewery expansion is targeted to be completed over the three-year period from the date of the Beer Business Acquisition, with total spend estimated to be in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion.  We have invested approximately $124 million in the Brewery expansion for Fiscal 2014.



Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, we and Modelo, indirectly, each had an equal interest in Crown Imports, which had the exclusive right to import, market and sell the Mexican Beer Brands.



Wine and Spirits



We are the world’s leading producer and marketer of premium wine.  We sell a large number of wine brands across all categories – table wine, sparkling wine and dessert wine – and across all price points – popular, premium,









super-premium and fine wine – and we have a leading market position in the U.S., Canada and New Zealand.  Our portfolio of super-premium and fine wines is supported by vineyard holdings in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Italy.  Our premium spirit brands each have a leading position in their respective categories.



Our wine produced in the U.S. is primarily marketed domestically and in Canada and the U.K.  Wine produced in Canada is primarily marketed domestically.  Wine produced in New Zealand is primarily marketed in the U.S., Canada, Australia, the U.K. and domestically.  Wine produced in Italy is primarily marketed in the U.S., Canada and domestically.  In addition, we export our wine products to other major world markets.



In our spirits business, Svedka Vodka is imported from Sweden and is the second-largest imported vodka brand in the U.S.  Black Velvet Canadian Whisky is the second-largest Canadian whisky brand in the U.S.



In the U.S., we sell 14 of the top-selling 100 table wine brands and are a leading premium wine company.  Some of our well-known wine and spirits brands sold in the U.S., which comprise our U.S. Focus Brands (“Focus Brands”), include:

Wine BrandsSpirits BrandsArbor MistInniskillinRex GoliathBlack Velvet Canadian WhiskyBlack BoxKim CrawfordRobert MondaviSvedka VodkaBlackstoneMark WestRuffinoClos du BoisMount VeederSimiEstanciaNobiloToasted HeadFranciscan EstateRavenswoodWild Horse



We dedicate a large share of sales and marketing resources to these brands as they represent a majority of our U.S. wine and spirits revenue and profitability, and have strong positions in their respective price segments, mostly within the $5 to $20 price range at U.S. retail.  Within the Focus Brands, we have been increasing brand building support behind certain key brands which we collectively believe provide the best opportunity for growth and operating margin enhancement for our wine and spirits business.  These brands include Robert Mondavi, Svedka, Black Box, Rex Goliath, Clos du Bois, Ruffino, Estancia, Mark West, Kim Crawford and Nobilo.



We have been increasing resources in support of product innovation as we believe this is one of the key drivers of overall beverage alcohol category growth.  In wine, we have introduced varietal line extensions behind many of our focus brands and newer brands like The Dreaming Tree, Thorny Rose and Simply Naked.  In spirits, we have been introducing flavor extensions for Svedka and Black Velvet.



In Canada, we are the leading wine company and have six of the top-selling 25 table wine brands.  In this market, Jackson-Triggs is the top-selling wine brand and Inniskillin is the leading icewine brand.  In addition to our domestic brands, we are targeting to increase our import brand presence in this market with offerings like Robert Mondavi, Kim Crawford and Ruffino.



Corporate Operations and Other



The Corporate Operations and Other segment includes traditional corporate-related items including executive management, corporate development, corporate finance, human resources, internal audit, investor relations, legal, public relations and global information technology.



Further information regarding net sales, operating income and total assets of each of our business segments and information regarding geographic areas is set forth in Note 21 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.



Marketing and Distribution



To focus on their respective product categories, build brand equity and increase sales, our segments employ full-time, in-house marketing, sales and customer service functions.  These functions engage in a range of marketing activities and strategies, including market research, consumer and trade advertising, price promotions, point-of-sale









materials, event sponsorship, on-premise promotions and public relations.  Where opportunities exist, particularly with national accounts in the U.S., we leverage our sales and marketing skills across the organization.



In North America, our products are primarily distributed by wholesale distributors, with separate distribution networks utilized for our imported beer and wine and spirits portfolios, as well as state and provincial alcohol beverage control agencies.  As is the case with all other beverage alcohol companies, products sold through these agencies are subject to obtaining and maintaining listings to sell our products in that agency’s state or province.  State and provincial governments can affect prices paid by consumers of our products through the imposition of taxes or, in states and provinces in which the government acts as the distributor of our products through an alcohol beverage control agency, by directly setting the retail prices.



Trademarks and Distribution Agreements



Trademarks are an important aspect of our business.  We sell products under a number of trademarks, which we own or use under license.  Throughout our segments, we also have various licenses and distribution agreements for the sale, or the production and sale, of our products and products of third parties.  These licenses and distribution agreements have varying terms and durations.



Prior to the Beer Business Acquisition, all of our imported beer products were imported, marketed and sold through Crown Imports.  Crown Imports had entered into exclusive importation agreements with the suppliers of the imported beer products and had an exclusive sub-license to use certain trademarks related to the Mexican Beer Brands in the U.S. and Guam pursuant to a renewable sub-license agreement between Crown Imports and Marcas Modelo, S.A. de C.V.  As a result of the Beer Business Acquisition, our sub-license agreement for the exclusive use of the trademarks for our Mexican Beer Brands is now perpetual.



Competition



The beverage alcohol industry is highly competitive.  We compete on the basis of quality, price, brand recognition and distribution strength.  Our beverage alcohol products compete with other alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages for consumer purchases, as well as shelf space in retail stores, restaurant presence and wholesaler attention.  We compete with numerous multinational producers and distributors of beverage alcohol products, some of which have greater resources than we do.  Our principal competitors include:

BeerAnheuser-Busch InBev, MillerCoors, HeinekenWineU.S.E&J Gallo Winery, The Wine Group, Trinchero, Treasury Wine Estates, Deutsch Family Wine & Spirits, Ste. Michelle Wine Estates, Kendall-JacksonCanadaAndrew Peller, E&J Gallo Winery, Treasury Wine Estates, KrugerNew ZealandPernod Ricard, Lion Nathan, Treasury Wine EstatesSpiritsDiageo, Beam, Pernod Ricard, Bacardi, Brown-Forman



Production



Approximately55%of our Mexican Beer Brands requirements are produced by our Brewery, which is located in Nava, Coahuila, Mexico.  This location is approximately 10 miles from the Texas border.  The current capacity of the Brewery is 10 million hectoliters.  We intend to expand the Brewery’s capacity to 20 million hectoliters so it can produce all of our anticipated Mexican beer supply requirements.  The Brewery expansion is targeted to be completed over the three-year period from the date of the Beer Business Acquisition.  To meet our beer supply requirements above the current Brewery capacity, we have entered into a three-year interim supply agreement with Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (“ABI”).  This agreement also provides for up to two one-year extensions.  However, the United States, acting through the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (“DOJ”), has a right of approval, in its sole discretion, of any extension of the term of this interim supply agreement beyond three years.











In the U.S., we operate 18 wineries using many varieties of grapes grown principally in the Napa, Sonoma, Monterey and San Joaquin regions of California.  We also operate nine wineries in Canada, four wineries in New Zealand and five wineries in Italy.  Grapes are crushed at most of our wineries and stored as wine until packaged for sale under our brand names or sold in bulk.  The inventories of wine are usually at their highest levels during and after the crush of each year’s grape harvest, and are reduced prior to the subsequent year’s crush.  Wine inventories are usually at their highest levels in September through November in the U.S., Canada and Italy, and in March through May in New Zealand.



Our Canadian whisky requirements are produced and aged at our Canadian distillery in Lethbridge, Alberta.  Our requirements for grains and bulk spirits used in the production of Canadian whisky are purchased from various suppliers.



Sources and Availability of Production Materials



The principal components in the production of our Mexican Beer Brands at our Brewery include water; agricultural products, such as malt, hops and corn starch; and packaging materials, which include glass, aluminum and cardboard.  Packaging materials represent the largest cost component of production, with glass bottles representing the largest cost component of our packaging materials.  In Fiscal 2014, the package format mix of our beer volume sold in the U.S. was78%glass bottles,21%aluminum cans and1%in stainless steel kegs.



The Brewery receives allotments of water originating from a mountain aquifer.  We believe we have adequate access to water allotments to support the Brewery’s on-going requirements and future requirements after completing the Brewery expansion.  In connection with the Beer Business Acquisition, we have entered into a transition services agreement with ABI for the supply of glass, aluminum cans, can lids, crowns, caps, cartons, malt, hops, corn starch and yeast for a period of 36 months from the date of the acquisition.  Investments and efforts to establish stand-alone procurement systems and supply arrangements for the beer business operations are on-going and progressing.  We believe that ABI will have adequate sources of the materials noted above to meet our sales expectations.



The principal components in the production of our wine and spirits products are agricultural products, such as grapes and grain, and packaging materials (primarily glass).



Most of our annual grape requirements are satisfied by purchases from each year’s harvest which normally begins in August and runs through October in the U.S., Canada and Italy, and begins in February and runs through May in New Zealand.  We receive grapes from approximately1,040independent growers in the U.S., approximately100independent growers in Canada, approximately80independent growers in New Zealand and approximately10independent growers in Italy.  We enter into purchase agreements with a majority of these growers with pricing that generally varies year-to-year and is generally based on then-current market prices.



As ofFebruary 28, 2014, we owned or leased approximately20,000acres of land and vineyards, either fully bearing or under development, in the U.S., Canada, New Zealand and Italy.  This acreage supplies only a small percentage of our overall total grape needs for wine production.  However, most of this acreage is used to supply a large portion of the grapes used for the production of our super-premium and fine wines.  We continue to consider the purchase or lease of additional vineyards, and additional land for vineyard plantings, to supplement our grape supply.



We believe that we have adequate sources of grape supplies to meet our sales expectations.  However, when demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations, we look to source the extra requirements from the bulk wine markets around the world.



The distilled spirits manufactured and imported by us require various agricultural products, neutral grain spirits and bulk spirits which we fulfill through purchases from various sources by contractual arrangement and through purchases on the open market.  We believe that adequate supplies of the aforementioned products are available at the present time.











We utilize glass and polyethylene terephthalate (“PET”) bottles and other materials such as caps, corks, capsules, labels, wine bags and cardboard cartons in the bottling and packaging of our wine and spirits products.  After grape purchases, glass bottle costs are the largest component of our cost of product sold.  In the U.S. and Canada, the glass bottle industry is highly concentrated with only a small number of producers.  We have traditionally obtained, and continue to obtain, our glass requirements from a limited number of producers under long-term supply arrangements.  Currently, one producer supplies most of our glass container requirements for our U.S. operations and a portion of our glass container requirements for our Canadian operations, with the remaining portion for our Canadian operations supplied by another producer.  We have been able to satisfy our requirements with respect to the foregoing and consider our sources of supply to be adequate at this time.



Government Regulation



We are subject to a range of laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  Where we produce products, we are subject to environmental laws and regulations, and may be required to obtain environmental and alcohol beverage permits and licenses to operate our facilities.  Where we market and sell products, we may be subject to laws and regulations on brand registration, packaging and labeling, distribution methods and relationships, pricing and price changes, sales promotions, advertising and public relations.  We are also subject to rules and regulations relating to changes in officers or directors, ownership or control.



We believe we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable governmental laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate.  We also believe that the cost of administration and compliance with, and liability under, such laws and regulations does not have, and is not expected to have, a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.



Seasonality



The beverage alcohol industry is subject to seasonality in each major category.  As a result, in response to wholesaler and retailer demand which precedes consumer purchases, our imported beer sales are typically highest during the first and second quarters of our fiscal year, which correspond to the Spring and Summer periods in the U.S.  Our wine and spirits sales are typically highest during the third quarter of our fiscal year, primarily due to seasonal holiday buying.



Employees



As of the end of March 2014, we had approximately6,300employees.  Approximately3,300employees were in the U.S. and approximately3,000employees were outside of the U.S., primarily in Canada and Mexico.  We may employ additional workers during the grape crushing seasons.  We consider our employee relations generally to be good.
