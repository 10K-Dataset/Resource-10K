Information Concerning Eaton's Business in General

Raw Materials

Eaton's major requirements for raw materials include iron, steel, copper, nickel, aluminum, brass, tin, silver, lead, molybdenum, titanium, vanadium, rubber, plastic, electronic components, insulating materials and fluids. Materials are purchased in various forms, such as extrusions, castings, powder metal, metal sheets and strips, forging billets, bar stock, and plastic pellets. Raw materials, as well as parts and other components, are purchased from many suppliers, although there are limited sources of supply for electrical core steel and insulating fluids. Under normal circumstances, the Company has no difficulty obtaining its raw materials. In2013, Eaton maintained appropriate levels of inventory to prevent shortages and did not experience any availability constraints.

Patents and Trademarks

Eaton considers its intellectual property, including patents, trade names and trademarks, to be of significant value to its business as a whole. The Company's products are manufactured, marketed and sold under a portfolio of patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property, some of which expire at various dates in the future. Eaton develops and acquires new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and considers all of its intellectual property to be valuable. Based on the broad scope of the Company's product lines, management believes that the loss or expiration of any single intellectual property right would not have a material effect on Eaton's consolidated financial statements or its business segments. The Company's policy is to file applications and obtain patents for the great majority of its novel and innovative new products including product modifications and improvements.

Order Backlog

A significant portion of open orders placed with Eaton are by original equipment manufacturers of trucks, off-highway vehicles, and passenger cars. These open orders are not considered firm as they have been historically subject to month-to-month releases by customers during each model year. In measuring backlog orders, only the amount of orders to which customers are firmly committed are included. Using this criterion, total backlog atDecember 31, 2013and2012was approximately $4.6 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively. Backlog should not be relied upon as being indicative of results of operations for future periods.









Research and Development

Research and development expenses for new products and improvement of existing products in2013,2012and2011were$644 million,$439 million, and$417 million, respectively. Over the past five years, the Company has invested approximately $2.3 billion in research and development.

Environmental Contingencies

Operations of the Company involve the use and disposal of certain substances regulated under environmental protection laws. Eaton continues to modify processes on an ongoing, regular basis in order to reduce the impact on the environment, including the reduction or elimination of certain chemicals used in, and wastes generated from, operations. Compliance with laws that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, are not expected to have a material adverse effect upon earnings or the competitive position of the Company. Eaton's estimated capital expenditures for environmental control facilities are not expected to be material for2014and2015. Information regarding the Company's liabilities related to environmental matters is presented in Note 7 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
