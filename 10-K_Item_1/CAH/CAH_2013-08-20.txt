Item 1: Business

General

Cardinal Health, Inc. is an Ohio corporation formed in 1979. As used in this report, “we,” “our,” “us” and similar pronouns refer to Cardinal Health, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. We are a healthcare services company providing pharmaceutical and medical products and services that help pharmacies, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, clinical laboratories, physician offices and other healthcare providers focus on patient care while reducing costs, enhancing efficiency and improving quality.  We also provide medical products to patients in the home.

Our fiscal year ends on June 30. References to fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 are to the fiscal years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Except as otherwise specified, information in this Form 10-K is provided as of June 30, 2013.

Pharmaceutical Segment

In the United States, including Puerto Rico, the Pharmaceutical segment:

•distributes branded and generic pharmaceutical, over-the-counter healthcare and consumer products through its Pharmaceutical Distribution division to retailers (including chain and independent drug stores and pharmacy departments of supermarkets and mass merchandisers), hospitals and other healthcare providers. This division:

•maintains prime vendor relationships that streamline the purchasing process resulting in greater efficiency and lower costs for our customers;

•renders services to pharmaceutical manufacturers including distribution, inventory management, data reporting, new product launch support, and contract pricing and chargeback administration;

•franchises retail pharmacies under the Medicine Shoppe®and Medicap®brands; and

•provides pharmacy services to hospitals and other healthcare facilities;

•operates nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities through its Nuclear Pharmacy Services division that manufacture, prepare and deliver radiopharmaceuticals for use in nuclear imaging and other procedures in hospitals and physician offices; and

•distributes specialty pharmaceutical products, provides services to pharmaceutical manufacturers, third-party payors and healthcare providers supporting the marketing, distribution and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products, and operates a specialty pharmacy through its Specialty Solutions division.

In China, the Pharmaceutical segment distributes branded, generic and specialty pharmaceuticals, over-the-counter and consumer products as well as provides logistics, marketing and other services and operates specialty pharmacies through Cardinal Health China.

Pharmaceutical Distribution

Our Pharmaceutical Distribution division generates gross margin when the aggregate selling price to our customers exceeds the aggregate cost



of products sold, net of cash discounts. Gross margin includes margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs and margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements. Margin from our generic pharmaceutical programs includes price discounts and rebates and may include price appreciation on some products. Our earnings on generic pharmaceuticals are generally highest during the period immediately following the initial launch of a generic product because generic pharmaceutical selling prices are generally highest during that period and tend to decline over time, although this may vary. Margin from branded pharmaceutical agreements refers primarily to fees we receive for rendering a range of distribution and related services to manufacturers and also includes benefits from pharmaceutical price appreciation.

Bulk and Non-Bulk Sales

The Pharmaceutical segment historically has differentiated between bulk and non-bulk sales based on the nature of our customers’ operations when presenting information on the segment's operations. The table below shows the Pharmaceutical segment's revenue, segment expenses, segment profit and segment profit as a percentage of revenue for bulk and non-bulk sales:

(in millions)201320122011Non-bulk sales:Revenue from non-bulk sales$61,309$57,738$51,816Segment expenses allocated to non-bulk sales (1)59,69356,33450,622Segment profit from non-bulk sales (1)$1,616$1,404$1,194Segment profit from non-bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from non-bulk sales (1)2.64%2.43%2.31%Bulk sales:Revenue from bulk sales$29,788$40,187$41,928Segment expenses allocated to bulk sales (1)29,67040,03341,793Segment profit from bulk sales (1)$118$154$135Segment profit from bulk sales as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales (1)0.40%0.38%0.32%

(1)Segment expenses and profit required complex and subjective estimates and allocations based upon assumptions, past experience and judgment that we believe were reasonable.

Bulk sales consisted of sales to retail chain customers’ centralized warehouse operations and customers’ mail order businesses in the United States. All other sales were classified as non-bulk. Sales to a retail chain pharmacy customer were classified as bulk sales with respect to its warehouse operations and non-bulk sales with respect to its retail stores.

Substantially all bulk sales consisted of products shipped in the same form that we received them from the manufacturer; a small portion of bulk sales were broken down into smaller units prior to shipping. In contrast, non-bulk sales required more complex servicing. For non-bulk sales, we may have received inventory in large or full case quantities and broken it down into smaller quantities, warehoused the product for a longer period of time, picked individual products specific to a customer’s order and delivered that smaller order to a customer location.

Bulk sales generated significantly lower segment profit as a percentage of revenue than non-bulk sales. Customers received lower pricing on bulk sales of the same products than non-bulk sales, as bulk sales required fewer services to be provided to these customers, and hence, less costs were incurred by us in providing these products. In addition, bulk sales in the aggregate generated higher segment cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue than non-bulk sales due to the mix of products sold








Table of ContentsCardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries



within the bulk category. Segment distribution, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from bulk sales were substantially lower than from non-bulk sales because bulk sales required substantially fewer services to be rendered by us than non-bulk sales.

In light of the reduction in bulk sales after the expiration of our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen Co. ("Walgreens"), we do not expect the distinction between revenue and profit from bulk sales to be meaningful in the future. As such, in the future, we do not expect to present separate information on bulk and non-bulk sales to investors.

Specialty Pharmaceutical Products and Services

We refer to products and services offered by our Specialty Solutions division as “specialty pharmaceutical products and services.” The Specialty Solutions division currently (1) distributes oncology, rheumatology, urology and other pharmaceutical products ("specialty pharmaceutical products") to physician offices; (2) distributes human plasma products and some specialty pharmaceutical products to hospitals and other healthcare providers; (3) provides various consulting and other services to pharmaceutical manufacturers, third-party payors and healthcare providers primarily supporting the marketing, distribution and payment for specialty pharmaceutical products; and (4) operates a specialty pharmacy. Our use of the terminology "specialty pharmaceutical products and services" may not be comparable to the use of that terminology by other industry participants.

(1)Includes the assumption of approximately $57 million in debt.

(2)Includes $506 million in cash paid on the acquisition date and $14 million paid in fiscal 2012 and 2013 in connection with the contingent consideration obligation. The contingent consideration obligation had an acquisition date fair value of $92 million.

In addition, we completed several smaller acquisitions during the last five fiscal years, including purchasing Borschow Hospital & Medical Supplies, Inc. in fiscal 2009 and Futuremed Healthcare Products Corporation in fiscal 2012.

During the past five fiscal years, we also completed several divestitures, including selling our United Kingdom-based Martindale injectable manufacturing business in fiscal 2010. In addition, effective August 31, 2009, we separated our clinical and medical products businesses through a distribution to our shareholders of 81 percent of the then outstanding common stock of CareFusion Corporation ("CareFusion") and retained the remaining shares of CareFusion common stock (the "CareFusion Spin-Off"). During fiscal 2010 and 2011, we disposed of the remaining shares of CareFusion common stock.

Customers

Our largest customers, CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”) and Walgreens accounted for approximately23 percentand20 percent, respectively, of our fiscal 2013 revenue. In the aggregate, our five largest customers, including CVS and Walgreens, accounted for approximately52 percentof our fiscal 2013 revenue. In March 2013, we announced that our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreens, which expires at the end of August 2013, would not be renewed. Our pharmaceutical distribution contract with Express Scripts, Inc. ("Express Scripts"), which was our third largest customer in fiscal 2012, expired in September 2012.

In addition, we have agreements with group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) that act as agents to negotiate vendor contracts on behalf of their members. Our two largest GPO relationships in terms of member revenue are with Novation, LLC and Premier Purchasing Partners, L.P. Sales to members of these two GPOs collectively accounted for13 percentof our revenue in fiscal 2013.

Suppliers

We rely on many different suppliers. Products obtained from our five largest suppliers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 25 percent of our revenue during fiscal 2013, but no single supplier’s products accounted for more than 6 percent of that revenue. Overall, we believe our relationships with our suppliers are good.

The Pharmaceutical Distribution division is a party to distribution service agreements with pharmaceutical manufacturers. These agreements generally have terms ranging from one year, with an automatic renewal feature, to five years. Generally, these agreements are terminable before they expire only if the parties mutually agree, if there is an uncured breach of the agreement, or if one party is the subject of a bankruptcy filing or similar insolvency event. Some agreements allow the manufacturer to terminate the agreement without cause within a defined notice period.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive environment in the distribution of pharmaceuticals and related healthcare services. We also operate in a highly competitive environment in the development, manufacturing and distribution of medical and surgical products. We compete on many levels, including service offerings, support services, breadth of product lines and price.

In the Pharmaceutical segment, we compete with wholesale distributors with national reach (including McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation and H.D. Smith), regional wholesale distributors (including Morris & Dickson Co., L.L.C.), self-warehousing chains, specialty distributors, third-party logistics companies (including United Parcel Service, Inc.) and nuclear pharmacies, among others. In addition, the Pharmaceutical segment has experienced competition from a number of organizations offering generic pharmaceuticals, including telemarketers. We also compete with manufacturers that sell all or part of their product offerings direct.

In the Medical segment, we compete with many different distributors, including Owens & Minor, Inc., Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., McKesson Corporation, Henry Schein, Inc., Medline Industries, Inc., Mediq NV (through Byram Healthcare) and CCS Medical Holdings, Inc. We also compete with regional medical products distributors and third-party logistics companies. In addition,we compete with manufacturers that sell all or part of their product offerings direct. Competitors of the Medical segment’s manufacturing and procedural kit businesses include Kimberly-Clark Corporation, Ansell Limited, DeRoyal Industries Inc., Medline Industries, Inc., Professional Hospital Supply and Medical Action Industries.

Employees

At June 30, 2013, we had approximately 24,200 employees in the United States and approximately 9,400 employees outside of the United States. Overall, we consider our employee relations to be good.

Intellectual Property

We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, nondisclosure and other contractual provisions, and technical measures to protect our products, services and intangible assets. We hold patents relating to: (1) medical and surgical products, such as fluid suction and irrigation devices; surgical waste management systems; surgical and medical examination gloves; surgical drapes, gowns and facial protection



products; and patient temperature management products; and (2) the distribution of our nuclear pharmacy products and service offerings. We also operate under licenses for certain proprietary technologies, and in certain instances we license our technologies to third parties.

We believe that we have taken all necessary steps to protect our proprietary rights, but no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully enforce or protect our rights in the event that they are infringed upon by a third party.  While all of these proprietary rights are important to our operations, we do not consider any particular patent, trademark, license, franchise or concession to be material to our overall business.

Regulatory Matters

Our business is highly regulated in the United States at both the federal and state level and in foreign countries. Depending upon their specific business, our subsidiaries may be subject to regulation by government entities including:

•the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”);

•the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (the “DEA”);

•the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the “NRC”);

•the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;

•the U.S. Federal Trade Commission;

•U.S. Customs and Border Protection;

•state boards of pharmacy;

•state controlled substance agencies;

•state health departments, insurance departments or other comparable state agencies; and

•foreign agencies that are comparable to those listed above.

These regulatory agencies have a variety of civil, administrative and criminal sanctions at their disposal. They can suspend our ability to distribute products or can initiate product recalls; they can seize products or impose criminal, civil and administrative sanctions; and they can seek injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products.

Distribution

The FDA, DEA and various state authorities regulate the marketing, purchase, storage and distribution of pharmaceutical and medical products under various state and federal statutes including the Prescription Drug Marketing Act of 1987 and the Federal Controlled Substances Act (the "CSA"), which governs the sale, packaging, storage and distribution of controlled substances. Wholesale distributors of controlled substances must hold valid DEA registrations and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards, and comply with the CSA. As further discussed in Note 8 of the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements," in May 2012, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DEA pursuant to which our Lakeland, Florida pharmaceutical distribution center's registration to distribute controlled substances will be reinstated by the DEA in May 2014, subject to our compliance with the settlement agreement. Prior to reinstatement, our Lakeland facility will continue to distribute pharmaceutical products (other than controlled substances) while controlled substances will be shipped to customers from our other distribution centers.

Manufacturing and Marketing

Our subsidiaries that manufacture and source medical devices or pharmaceuticals may be subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable








Table of ContentsCardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries



foreign agencies including regulations regarding compliance with good manufacturing practices and quality systems.

The FDA and other domestic and foreign governmental agencies administer requirements that cover the design, testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, promotion and advertising, distribution, importation and post-market surveillance of some of our manufactured products. We need specific approval or clearance from regulatory authorities before we can market and sell many of our products in particular countries. Even after we obtain approval or clearance to market a product, the product and our manufacturing processes are subject to continued regulatory review.

From time to time, we may determine that products we manufacture or market do not meet our specifications, regulatory requirements, or published standards. When we or a regulatory agency identify a quality or regulatory issue, we investigate and take appropriate corrective action, which may include withdrawing the product from the market, correcting the product at the customer location, revising product labeling, and notifying customers.

Nuclear Pharmacies and Related Businesses

Our nuclear pharmacies and cyclotron facilities require licenses or permits and must abide by regulations from the NRC, applicable state boards of pharmacy and the radiologic health agency or department of health of each state in which we operate. In addition, our cyclotron facilities must comply with the FDA's good manufacturing practices regulations for positron emission tomography, or PET, drugs.

Prescription Drug Pedigree Tracking and Supply Chain Integrity

There have been increasing efforts by Congress and state and federal agencies to regulate the pharmaceutical distribution system in order to prevent the introduction of counterfeit, adulterated or mislabeled drugs into the pharmaceutical distribution system (also known as "pedigree tracking”). The U.S. House of Representatives passed a pedigree tracking bill in June 2013 that would initially establish a lot-based pedigree tracking system. Some states also have adopted or are considering adopting pedigree tracking laws. For example, effective July 2016, California will require that pharmaceutical wholesalers implement electronic track-and-trace capabilities for pharmaceutical products.

Government Healthcare Programs

We are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws. These laws generally prohibit companies from soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any compensation in order to induce someone to order or purchase items or services that are in any way paid for by Medicare, Medicaid or other U.S. government-sponsored healthcare programs. They also prohibit submitting or causing to be submitted any fraudulent claim for payment by the federal government. Violations of these laws may result in criminal or civil penalties, as well as breach of contract claims andqui tamactions (false claims cases initiated by private parties purporting to act on behalf of federal or state governments).

AssuraMed is a Medicare-certified supplier with respect to a small portion of its business. It must meet defined Medicare quality standards and maintain accreditation to receive reimbursement from Medicare, and  must comply with applicable billing, payment and record-keeping requirements. Failure to comply with Medicare supplier standards and billing requirements could result in civil and criminal sanctions, including the loss



of our ability to participate in Medicare and other federal and state healthcare programs.

In addition, our U.S. federal and state government contracts are subject to specific procurement regulations. Failure to comply with applicable rules or regulations or with a contractual or other requirements may result inqui tamactions, monetary damages and criminal and civil penalties. In addition, our government contracts could be terminated and we could be suspended or debarred from government contract work.

Health and Personal Information Practices

Services and products provided by some of our businesses involve access to patient-identifiable healthcare information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as augmented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, as well as some state laws, regulate the use and disclosure of patient-identifiable health information, including requiring specified privacy and security measures. Federal and state officials have increasingly focused on how patient-identifiable healthcare information should be handled, secured and disclosed.

Some of our businesses collect and maintain other sensitive personal information that is subject to federal and state laws protecting such information. Security and disclosure of personal information is also highly regulated in many other countries in which we operate.

Environmental, Health and Safety Laws

In the United States and other countries, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, as well as laws relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices.

Laws Relating to Foreign Trade and Operations

U.S. and international laws require us to abide by standards relating to the import and export of finished goods, raw materials and supplies and the handling of information. We also must comply with various export control and trade embargo laws, which may require licenses or other authorizations for transactions within some countries or with some counterparties.

Similarly, we are subject to laws concerning the conduct of our foreign operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, Chinese anti-corruption laws and other foreign anti-bribery laws. Among other things, these laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from offering, promising or making payments to officials of foreign governments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.

Regulation in China

Our China operations are subject to national, regional and local regulations, including licensing and regulatory requirements of the China National Health and Family Planning Commission, Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Finance, the China Food and Drug Administration, the National Reform and Development Commission and the General Administration of Customs.

Other Information

Although our agreements with manufacturers sometimes require us to maintain inventory levels within specified ranges, our distribution businesses are generally not required by our customers to maintain particular inventory levels other than as needed to meet service level requirements. Certain supply contracts with U.S. government entities require us to maintain sufficient inventory to meet emergency demands,








Table of ContentsCardinal Health, Inc. and Subsidiaries



but we do not believe those requirements materially affect inventory levels.

Our customer return policies generally require that the product be physically returned, subject to restocking fees. We only allow customers to return products that can be added back to inventory and resold at full value, or that can be returned to vendors for credit.

We offer market payment terms to our customers.
