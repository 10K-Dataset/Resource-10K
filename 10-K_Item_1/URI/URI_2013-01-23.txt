Item 1.Business

General

United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world. Our customer service network consists of836rental locations in the United States and Canada as well as centralized call centers and online capabilities. We offer approximately3,300classes of equipment for rent to customers that include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners, and government entities. In2012, we generated total revenues of$4.1billion, including$3.5billion of equipment rental revenue.

As ofDecember 31, 2012, our fleet of rental equipment included approximately400,000units. The total original equipment cost of our fleet (“OEC”), based on the initial consideration paid, was$7.2billion atDecember 31, 2012, compared with $4.0 billion atDecember 31, 2011. Our fleet atDecember 31, 2012includes fleet acquired in the acquisition of RSC Holdings Inc. (“RSC”) discussed below. The fleet includes:

•General construction and industrial equipment, such as backhoes, skid-steer loaders, forklifts, earthmoving equipment and material handling equipment, which accounted for approximately45percent,41 percentand41 percentof2012,2011and2010equipment rental revenue, respectively;

•Aerial work platforms,such as boom lifts and scissor lifts, which accounted for approximately36percent,39 percentand40 percentof2012,2011and2010equipment rental revenue, respectively;

•General tools and light equipment, such as pressure washers, water pumps and power tools, which accounted for approximately9percent,8 percentand9 percentof2012,2011and2010equipment rental revenue, respectively;

•Power and HVAC (“heating, ventilating and air conditioning”) equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment, which accounted for approximately6percent,6 percentand5 percentof2012,2011and2010equipment rental revenue, respectively; and

•Trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, which accounted for approximately4percent,6 percentand5 percentof2012,2011and2010equipment rental revenue, respectively.

In addition to renting equipment, we sell new and used equipment as well as related parts and service, and contractor supplies.

Acquisition of RSC

On April 30, 2012, we acquired 100 percent of the outstanding common shares and voting interest (“the acquisition”) of RSC. The results of RSC's operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since that date. RSC, which had total revenues of $1.5 billion in 2011, was one of the largest equipment rental providers in North America, and as of December 31, 2011 had a network of 440 rental locations in 43 U.S. states and three Canadian provinces. The acquisition has created a leading North American equipment rental company with a more attractive business mix, greater scale and enhanced growth prospects, and we believe that the acquisition will provide us with financial benefits including reduced operating expenses and additional revenue opportunities going forward. For additional information concerning the RSC acquisition, see note3to our consolidated financial statements.

Strategy

For the past several years, we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion. To achieve this objective, we have developed a strategy focused on customer service differentiation, customer segmentation, rate management, fleet management and disciplined cost control. This strategy calls for a consistently superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; an increasing









proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts; a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets; and the profitable deployment of our rental assets for optimal return on investment.

In 2012, we adopted the American Rental Association criteria for rental rates, time utilization and OEC; comparisons to prior years are based on a recast of these metrics on the same basis.

Although uncertainty in the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our Company and the North American equipment rental industry in2012, we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy. For the full year2012, compared with2011, these achievements included:

•A6.9percent increase in rental rates on a pro forma basis (that is, assuming United Rentals and RSC were combined for full year 2012 and 2011);

•A63.2percent increase in the volume of OEC on rent, which significantly benefited from the impact of the RSC acquisition;

•Achieved strong time utilization on a significantly larger fleet. Time utilization was67.5percent and67.2percent for the years endedDecember 31, 2012and2011, respectively;

•A significant increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from National Account customers, from 35 percent in2011to42percent in2012.2012is only available on a pro forma basis. National Accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least $500,000 or customers doing business in multiple locations;

•Continued improvement in customer service management, including a significant increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from accounts that are managed by a single point of contact ("key accounts"), from 55 percent in2011to60percent in2012.2012is only available on a pro forma basis. Establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory;

•The continued optimization of our network of rental locations, including an increase in2012of 15, or 16 percent, in the number of rental locations in our trench safety, power and HVAC segment; and

•A1.3percentage point improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.

In2013, we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process, enhanced customer service capabilities and sustained cost efficiencies. In particular, we will focus on:

•Enhancing our value proposition by improving customer service levels;

•Further increasing the proportion of our revenues derived from National Accounts and other large customers. To the extent that we are successful, we believe that we can improve our equipment rental gross margin and overall profitability over time, as large accounts tend to rent more equipment for longer periods and can be serviced more cost effectively than short-term transactional customers;

•Accelerating our pursuit of opportunities in the industrial marketplace, where we believe that our depth of resources, industrial expertise and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage. Additionally, industrial equipment demand is subject to different cyclical pressures than construction demand, making our aggregate end markets less volatile;

•Further capitalizing on the demand for the higher-margin power and climate control equipment offered by our trench safety, power and HVAC segment;

•Leveraging technology and training to optimize the transportation of our rental equipment to and from customer jobsites; and

•Maximizing equipment utilization by reducing the average number of equipment units unavailable for rent and the average time a unit is unavailable for rent.

Industry Overview and Economic Outlook

We serve three principal end markets for equipment rental in North America: industrial/non-construction; commercial (or private non-residential) construction; and residential. In2012, based on an analysis of our charge customers’ Standard Industrial Classification (“SIC”) codes:

•Industrial/non-construction rentals to manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, shipbuilders, utilities, retail and other industries (including infrastructure) represented approximately50percent of our rental revenues;









•Commercial (or private non-residential) construction rentals related to the construction and remodeling of office, lodging, healthcare and other commercial facilities represented approximately46percent of our rental revenues; and

•Residential rentals for the construction and renovation of homes represented approximatelyfourpercent of our rental revenues.

We believe that overall U.S. construction activity in2012was relatively strong, but was still well below historic levels. We estimate that overall U.S. construction activity in2012grew approximately 10 percent on a year-over-year basis. In this environment, compared with the prior year, our rental rates increased6.9percent on a pro forma basis and our volume of OEC on rent, which significantly benefited from the impact of the RSC acquisition, increased63.2percent. We believe that these two metrics reflect, in addition to the impact of the RSC acquisition, a combination of positive factors: a relatively strong improvement in our operating environment; a secular shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment; and the benefit of our strategy, particularly our increased focus on National Accounts and other large customers. Although there is no certainty that these trends will continue, we believe that our strategy has already put us in a position to capitalize on our industry leadership and customer service differentiation in a continuing recovery.

In2013, based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators, we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover. Specifically, in2013, we expect that the U.S. equipment rental industry will achieve year-over-year revenue growth in the mid to high single digits.

Competitive Advantages

We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages:

Large and Diverse Rental Fleet. Our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities and/or wide varieties of equipment. We believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position.

We manage our rental fleet, which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry, utilizing a life-cycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels. As part of this life-cycle approach, we closely monitor repairs and maintenance expense and can anticipate, based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet, the optimum time to dispose of an asset. Our fleet age, which is calculated on an OEC-weighted basis, was47.2months atDecember 31, 2012compared with 50.3 months atDecember 31, 2011. AtDecember 31, 2012,91 percentof our fleet was current on its manufacturer's recommended maintenance.

Significant Purchasing Power. We purchase large amounts of equipment, contractor supplies and other items, which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing, warranty and other terms with our vendors.

National Account Program. Our National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. We offer our National Account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across North America, a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs. Establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory. During the years endedDecember 31, 2012and2011,60percent and 55 percent, respectively, of our equipment rental revenues were derived from accounts, including National Accounts and other key accounts, that are managed by a single point of contact.2012National Account revenues are only available on a pro forma basis (that is, assuming United Rentals and RSC were combined for the full year).

Operating Efficiencies. We benefit from the following operating efficiencies:

•Equipment Sharing Among Branches. We generally group our branches into districts of five to 10 locations that are in the same geographic area. Our districts are generally grouped into regions of six to seven districts. Each branch within a region can access equipment located elsewhere in the region. This sharing increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches. Additionally, fleet sharing allows us to be more disciplined with our capital spend.

•Customer Care Center. We have a Customer Care Center ("CCC") with locations in Tampa, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina that handles all 1-800-UR-RENTS telephone calls. The CCC handles many of the 1-800-UR-RENTS telephone calls without having to route them to individual branches, and allows us to provide a more uniform quality experience to customers, manage fleet sharing more effectively and free up branch employee time.

•Consolidation of Common Functions. We reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our branches, such as accounts payable, payroll, benefits and risk management, information technology and credit and collection.









Information Technology Systems. We have a wide variety of information technology systems, some proprietary and some licensed, that supports our operations. This information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions, respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches. We have an in-house team of information technology specialists that supports our systems.

Strong Brand Recognition. As the largest equipment rental company in the world, we have strong brand recognition, which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty.

Geographic and Customer Diversity. We have836rental locations in 49 states and 10 Canadian provinces and serve customers that range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. We believe that our geographic and customer diversity provides us with many advantages including:

•enabling us to better serve National Account customers with multiple locations;

•helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across North America; and

•reducing our dependence on any particular customer.

Our operations in Canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and (ii) the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. For additional financial information regarding our geographic diversity, see note4to our consolidated financial statements.

Strong and Motivated Branch Management. Each of our full-service branches has a branch manager who is supervised by a district manager. We believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry, and we empower them, within budgetary guidelines, to make day-to-day decisions concerning branch matters. Each regional office has a management team that monitors branch, district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls, including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews.

Employee Training Programs.We are dedicated to providing training and development opportunities to our employees. In2012, our employees enhanced their skills through over 300,000 hours of training, including safety training, sales and leadership training, equipment-related training from our suppliers and online courses covering a variety of relevant subjects. The hours include the training time of legacy RSC employees beginning July 1, 2012.

Risk Management and Safety Programs. Our risk management department is staffed by experienced professionals directing the procurement of insurance, managing claims made against the Company, and developing loss prevention programs to address workplace safety, driver safety and customer safety. The department’s primary focus is on the protection of our employees and assets, as well as protecting the Company from liability for accidental loss.

Segment Information

We have two reportable segments–general rentals and trench safety, power and HVAC. Segment financial information is presented in note4to our consolidated financial statements. The general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial and industrial equipment, general tools and light equipment, and related services and activities. The general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities and homeowners. The general rentals segment comprises 12 geographic regions–Eastern Canada, Gulf South, Industrial (which serves the geographic Gulf region and has a strong industrial presence), Mid-Atlantic, Mid-Central, Midwest, Mountain West, Northeast, Northwest, South, Southeast and Southwest–and operates throughout the United States and Canada. The trench safety, power and HVAC segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services. The trench safety, power and HVAC segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment operates throughout the United States and in Canada.

Products and Services

Our principal products and services are described below.

Equipment Rental. We offer for rent approximately3,300classes of rental equipment on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis. The types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment; aerial work platforms; trench safety equipment; power and HVAC equipment; and general tools and light equipment. The age of our fleet was47.2months atDecember 31, 2012, compared to 50.3 months atDecember 31, 2011.









Sales of Rental Equipment.We routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs, as well as the composition and size of our fleet. We also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for the equipment. Consistent with the life-cycle approach we use to manage our fleet, the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors, including changing general economic conditions, growth opportunities, the market for used equipment, the age of our fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer demand.

We utilize many channels to sell used equipment: through our national sales force, which can access many resale markets across North America; at auction; through brokers; and directly to manufacturers. We also sell used equipment through our website, which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale.

Sales of New Equipment. We sell equipment for many leading equipment manufacturers. The manufacturers that we represent and the brands that we carry include: Genie, JLG and Skyjack (aerial lifts); Multiquip, Wacker and Honda USA (compaction equipment, generators and pumps); Sullair (compressors); Skytrak and JLG (rough terrain reach forklifts); Takeuchi (skid-steer loaders); Terex (telehandlers); and DeWalt (generators). The type of new equipment that we sell varies by location.

Contractor Supplies Sales. We sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies. Our target customers for contractor supplies are our existing rental customers.

Service and Other Revenues. We also offer repair, maintenance and rental protection services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers. Our target customers for these types of ancillary services are our current rental customers as well as those who purchase both new and used equipment from our branches.

Customers

Our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. In2012, our largest customer accounted for approximately one percent of our revenues on a pro forma basis (that is, assuming United Rentals and RSC were combined for the full year) and our top 10 customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately five percent of our pro forma revenues.

Our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors, including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy, including construction opportunities with different customers. Our customers include:

•construction companies that use equipment for constructing and renovating commercial buildings, warehouses, industrial and manufacturing plants, office parks, airports, residential developments and other facilities;

•industrial companies—such as manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders and utilities—that use equipment for plant maintenance, upgrades, expansion and construction;

•municipalities that require equipment for a variety of purposes; and

•homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.

Our business is seasonal, with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months.

Sales and Marketing

We market our products and services through multiple channels as described below.

Sales Force. Our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center, and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs. We have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction.

National Account Program. Our National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. Our National Account team closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area.

E-Rentals. Our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at our E-Rentals portal, which can be found athttp://www.ur.com.Our customers can also use ourUR dataapplication to access real-time reports on their business activity with us.









Advertising. We promote our business through local and national advertising in various media, including trade publications, yellow pages, the Internet, radio and direct mail. We also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events.

Total Control®. We also utilize a proprietary software application, Total Control®, which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their rental equipment. This software can be integrated into the customers' enterprise resource planning system. Total Control®is a unique customer service tool that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers.

Suppliers

Our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements. This approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand. We utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors. We consider product capabilities and industry position, the terms being offered, product liability history, customer acceptance and financial strength. We estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 27 percent of our2012purchases of equipment, measured on a dollar basis, and that our 10 largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 68 percent of such purchases. We believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories.

Information Technology Systems

In support of our rental business, we have information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decision-making and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy. Each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our IBM System i™ system located at our data center. Rental transactions can be entered at these workstations and processed on a real-time basis. Management, branch and call center personnel can access these systems 24 hours a day.

These systems:

•enable branch personnel to (i) determine equipment availability, (ii) access all equipment within a geographic region and arrange for equipment to be delivered from anywhere in the region directly to the customer, (iii) monitor business activity on a real-time basis and (iv) obtain customized reports on a wide range of operating and financial data, including equipment utilization, rental rate trends, maintenance histories and customer transaction histories;

•permit customers to access their accounts online; and

•allow management to obtain a wide range of operational and financial data.

Our information technology systems and website are supported by our in-house group of information technology specialists working in conjunction with our strategic technology partners and service providers. This group trains our branch personnel; upgrades and customizes our systems; provides hardware and technology support; operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the day-to-day use of the systems; extends the systems to newly acquired locations; and manages our website.

We have a fully functional back-up facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial business systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative. This back-up facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems.

Competition

The U.S. equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. As the largest equipment rental company in the industry, we estimate that we have an approximate 12 percent market share based on2012equipment rental revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the American Rental Association (“ARA”). Our competitors primarily include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations; regional competitors that operate in one or more states; public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally; and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors. These advantages include greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to, and in anticipation of,









customer demand. The fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share, however, may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rate pressure.

Environmental and Safety Regulations

Our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws regulate issues such as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous wastes and materials, and air quality. Our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from above-ground storage tanks located at certain of our locations. Under environmental and safety laws, we may be liable for, among other things, (i) the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment, regardless of fault, and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. We incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations.

Employees

We have approximately11,300employees. Of these, approximately3,500are salaried personnel and approximately7,800are hourly personnel. Collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately80separate locations cover approximately800of our employees. We monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Available Information

We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as well as our other SEC filings, available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
