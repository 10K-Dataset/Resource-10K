Item 1.Business

General

United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world and our network consists of529rental locations in the United States and Canada. We offer approximately3,000classes of equipment for rent to customers that include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners, and government entities. In 2011, we generated total revenues of$2.6billion, including$2.2billion of equipment rental revenue.

As of December 31, 2011, our fleet of rental equipment included approximately230,000units. The total original equipment cost of our fleet (“OEC”), based on the initial consideration paid, was$4.3billion and $3.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The fleet includes:

•General construction and industrial equipment, such as backhoes, skid-steer loaders, forklifts, earthmoving equipment and material handling equipment, which accounted for approximately41percent of our total 2011 equipment rental revenue;

•Aerial work platforms,such as boom lifts and scissor lifts, which accounted for approximately39percent of our total 2011 equipment rental revenue;

•General tools and light equipment, such as pressure washers, water pumps, generators, heaters and power tools, which accounted for approximately8percent of our total 2011 equipment rental revenue;

•Trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, which accounted for approximately6percent of our total 2011 equipment rental revenue; and

•Power and HVAC (“heating, ventilating and air conditioning”) equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment including heating and cooling equipment, which accounted for approximately6percent of our total 2011 equipment rental revenue.

In addition to renting equipment, we sell new and used equipment as well as related contractor supplies, parts and service.

Proposed Acquisition of RSC Holdings, Inc.

On December 15, 2011, we entered into a definitive merger agreement with RSC Holdings, Inc. (“RSC”), pursuant to which we have agreed to acquire RSC in a cash-and-stock transaction that ascribes a total enterprise value of $4.2billion to RSC. RSC is one of the largest providers of rental equipment in North America, focusing on industrial, maintenance and non-residential construction markets, with approximately $2.7 billion of equipment at original cost as of September 30, 2011.  At the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of RSC common stock will be converted into the right to receive $10.80 in cash and 0.2783 of a share of our common stock. Total cash consideration paid to holders of RSC common stock is expected to be approximately $1.1billion and we anticipate issuing approximately29million shares of common stock in the merger.  In addition, at the effective time of the merger, the size of our board of directors will be increased as three of RSC's current independent directors designated by RSC will be appointed to our board of directors. The cash portion of the merger will be financed through new debt issuances and drawing on current loan facilities.  In connection with the proposed merger, we intend to re-pay the outstanding amounts on RSC's existing senior secured credit facilities and senior secured notes due2017, which totaled $854million as of September 30, 2011, and assume all of RSC's remaining $1.4billion of unsecured debt after such repayment.

The parties' obligations to complete the merger are subject to several conditions including, among others, (i) approval of the transaction by our stockholders and RSC stockholders, (ii) notification and clearance under certain antitrust statutes, (iii) delivery of tax opinions and a solvency opinion, (iv) the absence of any change, event, circumstance or development from the date of the merger agreement until the effective time of the merger, that has had or is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on us or RSC, and (v) other customary conditions, including the items described in our Current Report on Form









8-K filed December 21, 2011. We expect the merger to close in the first half of 2012.



As previously announced, our Board has indicated its intention to authorize a stock buyback of up to $200 million of the Company's common stock after closing of the RSC acquisition. Our current intention is to complete the stock buyback within six to twelve months after closing of the RSC acquisition. It is currently expected that the stock buyback will be financed by drawing on current loan facilities.

Strategy

For the past several years, we have focused on optimizing the profitability of our core rental business through revenue growth and margin expansion. To achieve this objective, we have developed a strategy focused on customer segmentation, rate management, fleet management and disciplined cost control. Additionally, we are continuing to strengthen our competitiveness through customer service excellence. This strategy calls for a superior standard of service to customers, often provided through a single point of contact; an increasing proportion of revenues derived from larger accounts; and a targeted presence in industrial and specialty markets.

Although the economic environment continued to present challenges for both our Company and the U.S. equipment rental industry in 2011, we succeeded in realizing a number of achievements related to our strategy. For the full year 2011, compared with 2010, these achievements included:

•A6.1percent increase in rental rates;

•A13.4percent increase in the volume of OEC on rent;

•A3.5percentage point increase in time utilization on a larger fleet;

•An increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from National Account customers, from 31 percent in 2010 to35percent in 2011. National Accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least $500,000 or customers doing business in multiple locations;

•Continued improvement in customer service management, including an increase in the proportion of equipment rental revenues derived from accounts that are managed by a single point of contact from 51 percent in 2010 to55percent in 2011. Establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us to provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory. Additionally, we expanded our centralized Customer Care Center (“CCC”). The CCC, which established a second base of operations in 2010, handled10percent more rental reservations in 2011 compared to 2010;

•The continued optimization of our network of rental locations, including an increase in 2011 of 7, or 9 percent, in the number of our trench safety, power and HVAC rental locations; and

•A0.8percentage point improvement in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue.

In 2012, we will continue to focus on optimizing our core business through diligent management of the rental process, the strengthening of our customer service capabilities, and sustained cost efficiencies. Additionally, we will focus on:

•Leveraging technology and training to improve rental rate performance and to optimize the transportation of our rental equipment to and from customer jobsites;

•Further increasing the proportion of our revenues derived from National Accounts and other large customers through customer segmentation. To the extent that we are successful, we believe that we can improve our equipment rental gross margin and overall profitability over time, as large accounts tend to rent more equipment for longer periods and can be serviced more cost effectively than short-term transactional customers;

•Accelerating our pursuit of opportunities in the industrial marketplace, where we believe our depth of resources and branch footprint give us a competitive advantage. Additionally, industrial equipment demand is subject to different cyclical pressures than construction demand, making our aggregate end markets less volatile; and

•Further capitalizing on the demand for the higher-margin power and climate control equipment rented by our trench safety, power and HVAC business.

Industry Overview and Economic Outlook

We serve four principal end markets for equipment rental in North America: commercial, infrastructure, industrial and residential. In 2011, based on an analysis of our charge customers’ Standard Industrial Classification (“SIC”) codes:

•Commercial (private non-residential) construction rentals related to the construction and remodeling of office, retail, lodging and healthcare and other commercial facilities represented approximately54percent of our rental revenues;









•Industrial rentals to manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders, utilities and other industries represented approximately22percent of our rental revenues;

•Infrastructure (private and public non-residential) construction rentals related to the building of public structures such as bridges, highways, power plants and airports represented approximately18percent of our rental revenues; and

•Residential rentals for the construction and renovation of homes represented approximately6percent of our rental revenues.

Although overall construction activity remained weak in 2011, our performance was strong. Compared with the prior year, our rental rates increased6.1percent and the volume of OEC on rent increased13.4percent. We believe these two metrics reflect a combination of positive factors: a modest improvement in our operating environment; a secular shift from customer ownership to the rental of construction equipment; and the benefit of our strategy, particularly our increased focus on National Accounts and other large customers. Although there is no certainty that these trends will continue, we believe that our strategy has already put us in a position to capitalize on our industry leadership and customer service differentiation in a recovery.

In 2012, based on our analysis of leading industry forecasts and broader economic indicators, we expect most of our end markets to continue to recover at a modest pace. Specifically, we estimate that U.S. spending on private non-residential construction, our primary end market, will show a single-digit percentage increase over 2011.

Competitive Advantages

We believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages:

Large and Diverse Rental Fleet. Our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities and/or wide varieties of equipment. We believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position.

We manage our rental fleet, which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry, utilizing a life-cycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels. As part of this life-cycle approach, we closely monitor repairs and maintenance expense and can anticipate, based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet, the optimum time to dispose of an asset. Our fleet age, which is calculated on a unit-weighted basis, was46.4months at December 31, 2011 compared with 47.7 months at December 31, 2010.

Significant Purchasing Power. We purchase large amounts of equipment, contractor supplies and other items, which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing, warranty and other terms with our vendors.

National Account Program. Our National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. We offer our National Account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across North America, a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs. Equipment rental revenues from National Account customers were approximately $750million and $575 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and represented approximately35and 31 percent of our total equipment rental revenues in 2011 and 2010, respectively. With our continued focus on large National Accounts, we expect this percentage to increase over time.

Operating Efficiencies. We benefit from the following operating efficiencies:

•Equipment Sharing Among Branches. We generally group our branches into districts of six to 10 locations that are in the same geographic area. Our districts are generally grouped into regions of seven to 11 districts. Each branch within a region can access equipment located elsewhere in the region. This sharing increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches. Additionally, fleet sharing allows us to be more disciplined with our capital spend.

•Customer Care Center. We have a CCC based in Tampa, Florida and Charlotte, North Carolina that handles all 1-800-UR-RENTS telephone calls. The CCC handles many of the 1-800-UR-RENTS telephone calls without having to route them to individual branches, which frees up branch employee time. In 2010, we established the North Carolina base of operations for the CCC, which facilitated the CCC’s handling of10percent more rental reservations in 2011 than in 2010. The CCC provides us with the ability to provide a more uniform quality experience to customers, manage fleet sharing more effectively and free up branch employee time.

•Consolidation of Common Functions. We reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our branches, such as accounts payable, payroll, benefits and risk management, information technology and credit and collection.









Information Technology Systems. We have a wide variety of information technology systems, some proprietary and some licensed, that support our operations. This information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions, respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches. We have an in-house team of information technology specialists that supports our systems.

Strong Brand Recognition. As the largest equipment rental company in the United States, we have strong brand recognition, which helps us to attract new customers and build customer loyalty.

Geographic and Customer Diversity. We have529rental locations in 48 states and 10 Canadian provinces and serve customers that range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. We believe that our geographic and customer diversity provides us with many advantages including:

•enabling us to better serve National Account customers with multiple locations;

•helping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across North America; and

•reducing our dependence on any particular customer.

Our operations in Canada are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and (ii) the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. For additional financial information regarding our geographic diversity, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.

Strong and Motivated Branch Management. Each of our full-service branches has a branch manager who is supervised by a district manager. We believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry and we empower them, within budgetary guidelines, to make day-to-day decisions concerning branch matters. Each regional office has a management team that monitors branch, district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls, including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews.

Employee Training Programs.We are dedicated to providing training and development opportunities to our employees. In 2011, our employees enhanced their skills through over 265,000 hours of training, including safety training, equipment-related training from our suppliers and online courses covering a variety of subjects.

Risk Management and Safety Programs. Our risk management department is staffed by experienced professionals directing the procurement of insurance, managing claims made against the Company, and developing loss prevention programs to address workplace safety, driver safety and customer safety. The department’s primary focus is on the protection of our employees and assets, as well as protecting the Company from liability for accidental loss.

Segment Information

We have two reportable segments–general rentals and trench safety, power and HVAC. Segment financial information is presented in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. The general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial, industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities. The general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities and homeowners. The general rentals segment comprises seven geographic regions–the Southwest, Gulf, Northwest, Southeast, Midwest, East, and the Northeast Canada–and operates throughout the United States and Canada. The trench safety, power and HVAC segment includes the rental of specialty construction products and related services. The trench safety, power and HVAC segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment operates throughout the United States and in Canada.

Products and Services

Our principal products and services are described below.

Equipment Rental. We offer for rent approximately3,000classes of rental equipment on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis. The types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment; aerial work platforms; trench safety equipment; power and HVAC equipment; and general tools and light equipment. The age of our fleet was46.4months at December 31, 2011, compared to 47.7 months at December 31, 2010.

Sales of Rental Equipment.We routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repairs and maintenance costs, as well as the composition and size of our fleet. We also sell used equipment in response to









customer demand for this equipment. Consistent with the life-cycle approach we use to manage our fleet, the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors, including changing general economic conditions, growth opportunities, the market for used equipment, the age of the fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer demand.

We utilize many channels to sell used equipment: through our national sales force, which can access many resale markets across North America; at auction; through brokers; and directly to manufacturers. We also sell used equipment through our website, which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale. In addition, we hold United Rentals Certified Auctions on eBay to provide customers with another convenient online tool for purchasing used equipment.

Sales of New Equipment. We sell equipment for many leading equipment manufacturers. The manufacturers that we represent and the brands that we carry include: Genie, JLG and Skyjack (aerial lifts); Multiquip, Wacker and Honda USA (compaction equipment, generators and pumps); Sullair (compressors); Skytrak and JLG (rough terrain reach forklifts); Takeuchi (skid-steer loaders); Terex (telehandlers); and DeWalt (generators). The type of new equipment that we sell varies by location.

Contractor Supplies Sales. We sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies. Our target customers for contractor supplies are our existing rental customers.

Service and Other Revenues. We also offer repair, maintenance and rental protection services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers. Our target customers for these types of ancillary services are our current rental customers as well as those who purchase both new and used equipment from our branches.

RENTALMAN(R)and INFOMANAGER(R)Software. We have two subsidiaries that develop and market software. One of the subsidiaries develops and markets RENTALMAN(R), which is an enterprise resource planning application used by ourselves and most of the other largest equipment rental companies. The other subsidiary develops and markets INFOMANAGER(R), which provides a complete solution for creating an advanced business intelligence system. INFOMANAGER(R)helps with extracting raw data from transactional applications, transforming it into more useful information and saving it in a database that is specifically optimized for analytical use.

Customers

Our customer base is highly diversified and ranges from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. In 2011, our largest customer accounted for less than one percent of our revenues and our top 10 customers in the aggregate accounted for approximately four percent of our revenues. Historically, over 90 percent of our business each year, as measured by equipment rental revenues, has been generated from previous customers.

Our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors, including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy, including construction opportunities with different customers. Our customers include:

•construction companies that use equipment for constructing and renovating commercial buildings, warehouses, industrial and manufacturing plants, office parks, airports, residential developments and other facilities;

•industrial companies—such as manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders and utilities—that use equipment for plant maintenance, upgrades, expansion and construction;

•municipalities that require equipment for a variety of purposes; and

•homeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.

Our business is seasonal, with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months.

Sales and Marketing

We market our products and services through multiple channels as described below.

Sales Force. We have approximately1,700sales people, including approximately900outside sales representatives who frequently travel to customer jobsites and meet with customers, and approximately800inside sales representatives who work in our branches and at our customer care center. Our sales representatives are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs. We have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction.

National Account Program. Our National Account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships









with large customers, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. Our National Account team, which consists of approximately 55 sales professionals and support staff, and includes those who service government agencies, closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area.

E-Rentals. Our customers can rent or buy equipment online 24 hours a day, seven days a week, at our E-Rentals portal, which can be found athttp://www.ur.com.Our customers can also use ourUR dataapplication to access real-time reports on their business activity with us.

Advertising. We promote our business through local and national advertising in various media, including trade publications, yellow pages, the Internet, radio and direct mail. We also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local promotional events.

Suppliers

Our strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements. This approach is designed to ensure the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand. We utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors. We consider product capabilities and industry position, the terms being offered, product liability history, customer acceptance and financial strength. We estimate that our largest supplier accounted for approximately 19 percent of our 2011 purchases of equipment, measured on a dollar basis, and that our 10 largest suppliers in the aggregate accounted for approximately 68 percent of such purchases. We believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories.

Information Technology Systems

In support of our rental business, we have information technology systems which facilitate rapid and informed decision-making and enable us to respond quickly to changing market conditions. Each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our IBM System i™ system located at our data center. Rental transactions can be entered at these workstations and processed on a real-time basis. Management, branch and call center personnel can access these systems 24 hours a day.

These systems:

•enable branch personnel to (i) determine equipment availability, (ii) access all equipment within a geographic region and arrange for equipment to be delivered from anywhere in the region directly to the customer, (iii) monitor business activity on a real-time basis and (iv) obtain customized reports on a wide range of operating and financial data, including equipment utilization, rental rate trends, maintenance histories and customer transaction histories;

•permit customers to access their accounts online; and

•allow management to obtain a wide range of operational and financial data.

Our information technology systems and website are supported by our in-house group of information technology specialists working in conjunction with our strategic technology partners and service providers. This group trains our branch personnel; upgrades and customizes our systems; provides hardware and technology support; operates a support desk to assist branch and other personnel in the day-to-day use of the systems; extends the systems to newly acquired locations; and manages our website.

Leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy. In 2011, we made the following investments in the area of technology:

•Pricing Optimization: We enhanced our price optimization software, which was deployed company-wide in 2010. We deployed a deal management application that allows us to evaluate and approve any preliminary pricing agreement the field employees enter into with a customer prior to approval in our systems. Our pricing system includes customer-centric pricing (differentiated pricing based on specific customer attributes) which is available in the branch rental system and is provided in real-time to our sales representatives in the field on their smartphones;

•Field Automation Strategy and Technology:We continued to increase the use of wireless handheld computers with GPS capabilities and route optimization and dispatching software for the delivery and pick-up of our equipment to improve service to our customers while operating more efficiently in our branches. This program is now used at approximately 75 percent of our branches. We expect to complete the company-wide deployment of handheld GPS devices and route optimization and dispatching software in 2012;

•Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”):We continued to improve our VoIP voice communication systems for our









call center, credit offices and a group of pilot branches, to better answer, transfer and route calls to provide improved customer service and internal collaboration. Our VoIP systems allow us to route calls to other branches in the area or to our call center when all branch personnel are busy serving customers;

•Customer Service Scorecard:All of our branches utilize a customer service scorecard to improve and monitor their performance across five critical dimensions: service response time, on-time delivery, off-rent pick-up time, equipment availability and billing dispute resolution. In 2011, we made the scorecards available to our sales representatives at the customer level; and

•Enterprise Data Warehouse:We initially implemented an enterprise data warehouse focused on supporting our customer service and sales force automation initiatives in 2009, and subsequently implemented additional reporting packages within the enterprise data warehouse focused on customer relationship management, sales force effectiveness, financial management, operations management and customer and product profitability. Additionally, automated campaigns and leads from internal and external data sources were routed to our sales force automation system to improve customer retention and increase our share of wallet.

Each of these investments is aligned with our strategic focus on customer service and operational efficiencies.

We have a fully functional back-up facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial business systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative. This back-up facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems.

Competition

The U.S. equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. As the largest equipment rental company in the industry, we estimate that we have an approximate nine percent market share and that the four largest companies, including RSC, account for approximately 24 percent of industry revenue, based on 2010 equipment rental revenues from construction and industrial equipment as measured by the American Rental Association (“ARA”). Our competitors primarily include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations; regional competitors that operate in one or more states; public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally; and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors. These advantages include greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to, and in anticipation of, customer demand. The fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share, however, may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rate pressure.

Environmental and Safety Regulations

Our operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws regulate such issues as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous wastes and materials, and air quality. Our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from above-ground storage tanks located at certain of our locations. Under environmental and safety laws, we may be liable for, among other things, (i) the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we sent hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment regardless of fault and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. We incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain of our locations.

Employees

We have approximately7,500employees. Of these, approximately2,500are salaried personnel and approximately5,000are hourly personnel. Collective bargaining agreements relating to65separate locations cover approximately650of our employees. We monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good.

Available Information

We make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as well as our other SEC filings, available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC.
