OUR STRATEGY AND STRENGTHS



In 2012, Quest Diagnostics launched a new vision, goals and strategy.  Our vision is:



Empowering Better Health with Diagnostic Insights.



We have three aspirational goals:

•A healthier world;

•Build a valuable company; and

•Create an inspiring workplace.



Our values are: quality, integrity, accountability, innovation, collaboration and leadership.



Our Strategy



At our first-ever Investor Day in November 2012, we introduced a five-point business strategy to help us achieve our vision and our goals.  As 2013 concluded, we revised the priority of the five points in the strategy, establishing restoring growth as our top priority.  In 2014, we executed our strategy and, at our second Investor Day, in November 2014, we shared our progress on the strategy and the commitments that we made at our Investor Day in November 2012, reaffirmed our strategy and outlined our path forward.



Our five point strategy is:

•Restore growth

•Drive operational excellence

•Simplify the organization

•Refocus on diagnostic information services

•Deliver disciplined capital deployment



The discussion below focuses on our five-point strategy and our path forward.



1. Restore growth.We are pursuing seven opportunities to restore growth.  Three of these opportunities have a near-term focus:  sales and marketing excellence; grow esoteric testing through a disease focus; and provide professional lab services to hospitals and IDNs.  The remaining four opportunities have a longer-term focus:  lead in precision medicine; create value from information assets; leverage capabilities into extended care settings; and succeed internationally.



Since 2012, our efforts to foster sales and marketing excellence have progressed.  We now maintain one commercial organization in our Diagnostic Information Services business, centrally led and focused on local customer needs.  We employ world-class management discipline around processes, tools and measurement.  We are investing in talent, providing sustained training and focusing on specialty opportunities, and have instilled a customer-focused, performance-driven culture.



We plan to grow by pursuing strategic partnerships with hospitals and IDNs.  We believe that continued price transparency, cost and utilization pressure, and evolving healthcare payment models will drive demand for our expertise in a range of strategic partnerships.  We offer a range of solutions, including reference testing, supply chain management, lab management outsourcing, outreach acquisition, other business solutions and joint ventures.  We can help our partners to succeed, including by consolidating data and delivering insights, delivering test management solutions to improve care and help control cost and by providing patient-focused programs to enable effective management of care.  We announced and implemented six new professional lab services relationships over the past year.



In addition, we plan to grow esoteric testing revenues by creating value through scientific and product innovation and delivering comprehensive solutions for major clinical opportunities.  We are more than just a laboratory: we seek to offer solutions using data information services and strategies that enable our customers to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals.  Starting with a clinical focus on a specific disease state or clinical problem, we pursue opportunities to create value by providing holistic solutions centered on evidence-supported standards of care, and to combine routine, guideline mandated testing with esoteric solutions.  We take advantage of advanced technology for more precise, comprehensive and useful information, and integrate our extensive clinical data to help manage populations and target health care solutions.



Our clinical franchise organizations, working with our research and development team, focus on these opportunities and coordinate with our commercial organization to deliver new and improved solutions.  The eight clinical franchise











organizations focus on: cancer; cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrinology; infectious disease and immunology; neurology; prescription drug monitoring and toxicology; sports diagnostics; general health and wellness; and women's and reproductive health.  Our franchises are designed to enable us to act like a boutique service provider while maintaining the advantages of our scale, and identify and tap growing market segments so that we more wisely deploy our resources and target opportunities.



Our comprehensive solutions for hepatitis c (from screening to treatment and monitoring), the growth of our prescription drug monitoring and general health and wellness businesses, and as we enter the era of precision medicine, the 2014 launch of our OncoVantageTMsolution in partnership with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, are recent examples of our strategy and the power of our clinical franchises to help us deliver new solutions and grow organically.



In 2013, we launched a multi-year initiative, Project Restore, to identify, prioritize, resource and implement a wide range of activities designed to create consistent, profitable growth.  For example, the program leverages centralized analytics and best practice teams to improve sales and marketing effectiveness, reduce attrition and bring to local teams lessons learned across the enterprise.  The investments that we've made and our efforts to improve our sales and marketing effectiveness, grow esoteric testing through our clinical franchise organizations and pursue strategic partnerships with hospitals, ACOs and IDNs have yielded positive results.  In 2014, we restored growth, primarily through acquisitions.  Our goal is to achieve and ultimately exceed market growth rates.



2. Drive operational excellence.To enhance operational excellence, we are focused on delivering a superior customer experience and driving cost excellence across every portion of our value chain, from the time that we receive an order until the time we receive payment, including in our supporting operations.  Improving our operations will yield many benefits, including: enhancing customer satisfaction, employee engagement and shareholder value; improving our quality and competitiveness; and strengthening our foundation for growth.



We have made strong progress driving operational excellence, improving our quality and efficiency and improving our overall customer experience.  For example, since 2012, we have consolidated contact centers by nearly 75% and enhanced our supply chain management, resulting in improved performance and greater efficiencies.  The 2014 opening of our new laboratory facility in Marlborough, MA, consolidating work from multiple legacy labs onto a standard, more efficient, state-of-the-art platform, is an example of the opportunities that we see to drive operational excellence.



Our cost excellence program, Invigorate, has consisted of several flagship programs, with structured plans in each, to drive savings and improve performance across the customer value chain.  These flagship programs include: organization excellence; information technology excellence; procurement excellence; service excellence; lab excellence; and billing excellence.  Invigorate delivered more than $200 million in realized savings in 2014.  We also exited 2014 with run-rate savings of more than $700 million, compared to 2011, surpassing the updated Invigorate goal of $600 million goal in run-rate savings by the end of 2014, compared to 2011.



In November 2014, we announced a goal to deliver an additional $600 million in run-rate savings as we exit 2017.  Achieving this goal would bring the total savings from the Invigorate initiative to $1.3 billion in run-rate savings, compared to 2011.  In addition to flagship program opportunities, we identified new key opportunities to change how we operate, in order to meet this goal.  These new key opportunities include: standardizing our processes, information technology systems, equipment and data; enhancing electronic enabling services; and enhancing reimbursement for work we perform.  We believe that our efforts to standardize our information technology systems, equipment and data also will foster our efforts to restore growth, supporting the value creation initiatives of our clinical franchises by enhancing our operational flexibility, empowering and enhancing the customer experience, facilitating the delivery of actionable insights and bolstering our large data platform.



3. Simplify the organization to enable growth and productivity.In 2012, we concluded that our organization was not structured to align well with our objectives.  Previously, the organization was too complex, and it failed to let the Company take advantage of its scale and capabilities.  In 2013 and 2014, we revised our senior management team; it now is composed of both executives who joined the Company prior to our current President and Chief Executive Officer and executives who joined thereafter.  We also restructured our organization to eliminate silos in our core business, provide for leadership in defined geographies and eliminate three unnecessary management layers.  Our new organization is designed to align around future growth opportunities, to align upstream and downstream units in our business for seamless execution and to leverage our company-wide infrastructure to gain more capability, value and efficiency.



We introduced the Quest Management System to manage our Company.  This system not only provides a foundation for day-to-day management, including best-in-class business performance tools, but also helps us to develop the capabilities that we need to manage the Company.  The system supports our efforts as we build a high-performance culture, with employees focused on behaviors to make us more agile, transparent, customer-focused, collaborative and performance oriented.  We











continue to simplify the organization, and our processes, to better focus on our customers, speed decision-making and to empower employees.



4. Refocus on diagnostic information services.We have a sharp focus on diagnostic information services.  Since 2012, we have sold our OralDNA salivary diagnostics business, our HemoCue and Enterix diagnostic products businesses and ibrutinib royalty rights, generating approximately $800 million of proceeds.  We continue to consider options for several other assets, including our products businesses.



5. Deliver disciplined capital deployment and strategically aligned accretive acquisitions.We are focused on increasing shareholder returns and returns on invested capital (“ROIC”) through a framework that encompasses improving operating performance and disciplined capital deployment.



Our disciplined capital deployment framework includes dividends, share repurchases and investment in our business and is intended to improve ROIC.  The framework is grounded in maintaining an investment grade credit rating.  We expect to return a majority of our free cash flow to investors through a combination of dividends and share repurchases.  Consistent with that expectation, in January 2015 we announced that we increased our quarterly common stock dividend by 15%, from $0.33 per common share to $0.38 per common share.   This represents our fourth increase in the dividend since 2011.  We believe that the dividend can grow over time.  We also believe that opportunities may arise to return incremental capital to shareholders from free cash flow as a result of portfolio actions.  Since 2012, we have returned more than $1 billion to stockholders through repurchases of our common stock.



We will continue to invest in our business in a disciplined manner.  We have established a solid foundation of strategic assets and capabilities.  We expect to generate 1 to 2 percent revenue growth per year through value-creating, strategically-aligned acquisitions using disciplined investment criteria.  We screen potential acquisitions using guidelines that assess strategic fit and financial considerations, including value creation, ROIC and impact on our earnings.  Since 2012, we have invested approximately $1 billion in seven acquisitions.  In 2014, we closed acquisitions of Solstas Lab Partners, significantly expanding our diagnostic information services business in the southeastern United States, and Summit Health, expanding our health and wellness services.



Our additional near-term investments in growth are likely to focus on investments in innovation in the form of licensing, collaborations and internal development to grow esoteric testing, tools to support commercial excellence and Project Restore.    We also expect to make investments to improve operational excellence, including, for example, systems standardization and automation, footprint optimization and Project Invigorate.

•our OncoVantageTMsolid tumor mutation testing services, based on our collaboration with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.





Our medical and scientific experts publish research that demonstrates the clinical value and importance of diagnostic testing, including in connection with our research and development efforts.  In 2014, they authored nearly 150 publications, including approximately 85 articles in peer-reviewed journals, that provided insights into diagnostic testing, introduced novel diagnostic approaches benefiting patients or provided the latest thinking in laboratory testing and disease diagnosis.  These publications addressed such topics as chikungunya virus, rheumatoid arthritis and the role of genetics in seizure disorders.  Our experts also help to shape the latest thinking as the authors of textbooks, or chapters therein, used by academic institutions to train healthcare providers.  Our experts also participate on scientific committees determining guidelines for diagnostic usage in a number of fields, such as HIV, HCV and testosterone testing.  We also publish Quest Diagnostics Health TrendsTMreports identifying trends in disease and wellness.  Recent reports focused on prescription drug misuse, coagulation testing, cervical disease, vitamin D, and cardiac health.



We see significant opportunity to use diagnostic information services to personalize treatment options based on the individual profile of each patient, including their genetic profile.  For example, we offer an “end-to-end” array of services for companion diagnostics.  We have expertise dealing with biomarkers in clinical trials and biomarker discovery capabilities, and can make available laboratory developed tests,in vitrodiagnostics (“IVD”) test kits and late-stage commercialization support for companion diagnostics for new therapies that will foster personalized patient treatment.



We successfully transfer technical innovations to the market through our relationships with technology developers, including the academic community and pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, our in-house expertise and our collaborations, including with emerging medical technology companies that develop and commercialize novel diagnostics, pharmaceutical and device technologies.  For example, in 2014 we introduced access to a new companion test service for two treatments for melanoma developed by bioMerieux, a leader in the field ofin vitrodiagnostics.  We search for new opportunities and continue to build a robust pipeline of new solutions.  Through our strengths in assay development and the commercialization of test services, we believe that we are the partner of choice for developers of new technologies and tests to introduce their products to the marketplace.



Information Technology.  We have a history of providing leading information technology for diagnostic information services, including solutions that help healthcare organizations and physicians enter, share and access clinical information











without costly information technology implementation or significant workflow disruption, and technology solutions to enable patients to manage their healthcare and medical information.  Good examples of this include our Care360®products, national Care 360®healthcare provider network and MyQuest®by Care360®patient healthcare portal, which allows patients to, among other things, use their smartphone or computer to receive and archive their Quest Diagnostics test results, manage their personal health information, find a Quest Diagnostics location and schedule appointments.  We were the first national diagnostic information services provider to offer patient appointment scheduling and a patient mobile application.

Diagnostic Information Services



Background - clinical testing.



Clinical testing is an essential element in the delivery of healthcare services. Physicians use clinical testing to assist in the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, monitoring and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions. Clinical testing is generally categorized as clinical laboratory testing and anatomic pathology services.



Clinical laboratory testing generally is performed on whole blood, serum, plasma and other body fluids, such as urine, and specimens such as microbiology samples. Clinical laboratory tests which can be performed by most clinical laboratories are considered routine.  Routine testing measures various important bodily health parameters such as the functions of the kidney, heart, liver, thyroid and other organs. Commonly ordered tests include blood chemistries, urinalysis, allergy tests and complete blood cell counts.



Esoteric tests are clinical laboratory tests that are not routine.  Esoteric tests include procedures in the areas of molecular diagnostics, protein chemistry, cellular immunology and advanced microbiology.  These tests may require professional “hands-on” attention from highly-skilled technical personnel, generally require more sophisticated technology, equipment or materials and may be performed less frequently than routine tests. Consequently, esoteric tests generally are reimbursed at higher levels than routine tests. It is not practical, from a cost-effectiveness or infrastructure perspective, for most hospitals, IDNs, ACOs, commercial laboratories or physician office laboratories to develop and perform a broad menu of esoteric tests, or to perform low-volume esoteric testing in-house. Such tests generally are outsourced to an esoteric clinical testing laboratory, which specializes in performing these complex tests.  Commonly ordered esoteric tests include viral and bacterial detection tests, drug therapy monitoring tests, gene-based tests, autoimmune panels and complex cancer evaluations.  Esoteric tests increasingly are ordered by physicians to assist them in the diagnostic process, to establish a prognosis and to choose or monitor a therapeutic regimen.



Anatomic pathology services are performed on tissues, such as biopsies, and other samples, such as human cells.  Anatomic pathology involves the diagnosis of cancer and other diseases and medical conditions through examination of tissue and cell samples taken from patients.

We see opportunities to bring our experience and expertise in diagnostic information services to markets outside the United States, including by leveraging existing facilities to serve new markets.



Innovation.



As discussed above under the subheadingsInnovationandInformation Technologyunder the headingOur Strengths, beginning on page 4, we are a leading innovator in diagnostic information services.



We seek innovations and solutions that help healthcare providers care for their patients through better predisposition, screening, monitoring, diagnosis, prognosis and treatment choices.  We seek to develop innovations and solutions that help to determine a patient's genotype or gene expression profile relative to a particular disease and its potential therapies, because they can help healthcare providers to determine a patient's susceptibility to disease or to tailor medical care to an individual's needs - such as determining if a medication might be an optimum choice for a particular person, or tailoring the right dosage once the proper medicine is prescribed.  In addition, we aim to develop holistic solutions responsive to challenges that healthcare providers and patients face, by developing solutions of multiple tests, information and services focused on specific clinical challenges, and taking advantage of the latest informatics capabilities.  We also look for innovations and solutions that are less invasive than currently available options, to increase the choices that healthcare providers and patients have for the collection of diagnostic samples.



With these priorities in mind, during 2014 our sports diagnostics franchise launched our Blueprint for AthletesTMservice, designed to help athletes to improve and maintain their performance.  In addition, we introduced over 60 new or enhanced disease area solutions, including those discussed below.

Diagnostic Solutions



Clinical Trials Testing.



We are a leading provider of central laboratory testing performed in connection with clinical research trials on new drugs, vaccines and certain medical devices. Clinical research trials are required by the FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities to assess the safety and efficacy of new drugs, vaccines and some medical devices. We see opportunities to develop novel tests to help speed drug approval processes for our clinical trials customers and, capitalizing on the trend to personalized medicine, to better focus patient therapy based on a patient's genetic markers. We have biomarker capabilities that advance our efforts to develop these tests, and offer an “end-to-end” array of services for companion diagnostics.  Our clinical trials business is further differentiated by access to a unique set of assets such as the company's patient service centers and our robust collection of laboratory data, which enable our customers to run clinical trials in the most efficient manner possible.



We have clinical trials testing centers in the United States, the United Kingdom and India, and we provide clinical trials testing in Argentina, Brazil, China and Singapore through affiliated laboratories.  We serve a broad range of large pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies.



Risk Assessment Services.



ExamOne is the largest provider of risk assessment services to the life insurance industry in North America. We also provide risk assessment services for insurance companies operating outside North America.



Our risk assessment services comprise underwriting support services, including data gathering, paramedical examinations and clinical laboratory testing and analytics, designed to assist life insurance companies objectively to evaluate the mortality risks of applicants. Most specimen collections and paramedical examinations are performed by our network of paramedical examiners at the applicant's home or workplace, but they also are offered at approximately 600 company patient service centers in the United States and approximately 120 additional locations in North America. We also contract with third parties to coordinate providing these exams at more than 350 additional locations outside North America.

Healthcare Information Technology.



We provide interoperable technologies that help healthcare organizations and physicians enter, share and access clinical information without costly information technology implementation or significant workflow disruption.



Our Care360®EHR product allows physicians to generate a complete record of a clinical patient encounter, automates and streamlines the clinician's workflow, and allows for rapid deployment and implementation with minimal workflow disruption. The solution allows doctors to electronically create, manage and distribute patient encounter notes and allows for patient communication via a patient portal.  It captures lab and radiology results, provides clinical decision support tools and allows doctors to send secure messages and clinical information to other practitioners and secure laboratory results to patients' personal health records.



ChartMaxx®is our enterprise content management system for hospitals.  Clients have contracted for its use at over 225 sites in North America to enable clinical and business workflows.



Non-Commercial, Development State Drug Assets



As a result of its 2011 acquisition of Celera Corporation, the Company also has an interest in non-commercial, development state drug assets.  The Company is evaluating options with respect to these interests.

We have an agreement with Merck & Co., Inc. ("Merck") under which Merck has a license to our intellectual property for the development of, among other things, small molecule inhibitors of cathepsin K. This agreement was entered into by a predecessor of Celera that Celera acquired in November 2001.  Under the agreement, we are entitled to receive future milestone payments based on development progress for each potential product under the agreement. We are also entitled to receive single digit royalty payments from the sale of drugs, if any, resulting from the program.  This drug development program entered Phase III clinical trials in September 2007 and Merck has disclosed its intent to file a New Drug Application in 2015.  We do not control the development activities conducted by Merck. Merck may not successfully develop or commercialize any compounds covered by the agreement and may not obtain needed regulatory approvals, and we may not receive any further payments under this agreement.



The Company may be entitled to milestone payments associated with the small molecule drug discovery and development programs sold by Celera to Pharmacyclics, Inc. in 2006.  These programs are for the treatment of cancer and other diseases, including programs that target histone deactylase, Factor VIIa, and B cell tyrosine kinases involved in immune function.  In addition, we will be entitled to royalty payments in the single digits based on annual sales of any drugs, other than ibrutinib, commercialized from the three programs, if any.  In 2013, we sold the rights to royalties from ibrutinib.  We have not received any royalty payments related to these programs.



We have no direct control over the amount or timing of resources devoted to any of these programs.  The programs may never meet the specified milestones or the programs may be terminated, and therefore may never generate milestone payments. Also, even if some milestones are met, there is no assurance that these programs will result in any product sales that would generate royalty payments to us.











Our small molecule program agreements will remain in effect for as long as any royalties are payable under the respective agreements. The obligation to pay royalties generally coincides with the life of the underlying patents. Each of the third parties with which we have agreements are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a therapeutic product and to pay us amounts due under the terms of the agreements, including milestone and/or royalty payments, promptly after the amounts become payable. These agreements generally are terminable upon an uncured material breach of the agreement by either party. In addition, Merck may terminate its agreement with us for any reason upon advance written notice, but would lose its license from us and would not be able to commercialize any product under the license.





THE UNITED STATES CLINICAL TESTING INDUSTRY



The U.S. clinical testing industry consists of two segments.  One segment, which we believe makes up approximately 40% of the total industry, includes hospital inpatient and outpatient testing.  The second segment, which we believe makes up approximately 60% of the total industry, includes testing of persons who are not hospital patients, including testing done in commercial clinical laboratories, physician-office laboratories and other locations, as well as hospital outreach testing.  Within the second segment, we believe that hospital outreach has been increasing share in the last few years.  We believe that hospital-affiliated laboratories account for approximately 60% of the total industry, commercial clinical laboratories approximately one-third and physician-office laboratories and other locations account for the balance.



Key Trends.The healthcare system in the United States is evolving; significant change is taking place in the system.  We expect that the evolution of the healthcare industry will continue, and that industry change is likely to be extensive.  There are a number of key trends that are having, and that we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on the diagnostic information services business in the United States and on our business. These trends present both opportunities and risks. However, because diagnostic information service is an essential healthcare service and because of the key trends discussed below, we believe that the industry will continue to grow over the long term and that we are well positioned to benefit from the long-term growth expected in the industry.



Demographics.As the population continues to grow and age, the burden of chronic diseases and unmet diagnostic needs may increase the demand for diagnostic information services.



Prevention and wellness.We believe that the value of detection, prevention, wellness and personalized care now is well recognized. Consumers, employers, ACOs, IDNs, health plans and government agencies increasingly focus on helping the healthy stay healthy, detecting symptoms among those at risk and providing preventive care that helps avoid disease. Health care providers increasingly rely on diagnostic information services to help identify risk for a disease, to detect the symptoms of disease earlier, to aid in the choice of therapeutic regimen, to monitor patient compliance and to evaluate treatment results. There is increased focus on a disease-oriented approach to diagnostics, treatment and management. Health care providers, consumers and payers increasingly recognize the value of diagnostic information services as a means to improve health and reduce the overall cost of healthcare through early detection, prevention and treatment.



Medical innovation.Medical advances allow for more accurate and earlier diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Continuing advances in genomics and proteomics are expected to yield new, more sophisticated and specialized diagnostic tests. These advances also are spurring interest in and demand for precision medicine, which relies on diagnostic and prognostic testing and in which data information services and strategies are used to deliver the most effective healthcare to the right populations and individuals. Pharmacogenomic testing increasingly is used as a parameter to help speed drug approval processes and to better focus therapy based on patient and tumor-specific genetic markers. Demand also is growing toward comprehensive care management solutions that serve patients, payers and health care providers by improving clinical decision support, access to patient data, increasing patient participation in care management, population health management and improving clinical outcomes. There is increasing focus on access to patient data and data-driven insights.



Customers and payers.Our customers and payers, including physicians, health plans, IDNs, ACOs, employers and others, have been consolidating and diversifying. For example, an increased number of hospital systems are considering establishing or have established health insurance plans, and health insurance plans increasingly are considering providing or are providing healthcare services.  Consolidation is increasing pricing transparency and bargaining power, and encouraging internalization of clinical testing.  Physicians increasingly are employed by hospital systems, IDNs, ACOs or large group practices integrated with healthcare systems, instead of organizing physician-owned practices, which is changing the dynamics for whether clinical testing is performed by a hospital or a non-hospital.  Value-based reimbursement is contributing to changes in the healthcare system.  ACOs and patient-centered medical homes are growing as a means to deliver patient care.  Health care services increasingly are being provided by non-traditional providers (e.g., physician assistants), in non-traditional venues (e.g., retail medical clinics, urgent care centers) and using new technologies (e.g., telemedicine).  In addition, federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 encourages the formation of ACOs and requires implementation of health insurance









exchanges, which is resulting in changes in the way that some healthcare services are purchased and delivered in the United States.  Patients are also our customers. Increasingly, patients are engaged in their own healthcare and are bearing responsibility for payment for the services that we provide to them.



Pricing Transparency.  There has been a trend toward greater pricing transparency in the healthcare marketplace.  This transparency, combined with increased patient financial responsibility for medical care, is enhancing purchasing sophistication and changes in behavior in the health care marketplace.



Competition.The clinical testing industry remains fragmented, is highly competitive and is subject to new competition. Competition is growing from non-traditional competitors. Increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position. New industry entrants with extensive resources may make acquisitions or expand into our traditional areas of operations.



Reimbursement pressure.  There is a strong focus in the United States on controlling the overall cost of healthcare.  Healthcare market participants, including governments, are focusing on controlling costs, including potentially by changing reimbursement for healthcare services (including but not limited to a shift from fee for service to capitation), revising test coding, changing medical coverage policies (e.g., healthcare benefits design), pre-authorization of lab testing, requiring co-pays, introducing lab spend management utilities and payment and patient care innovations such as ACOs and patient-centered medical homes.  In light of continued pressure to reduce systemic healthcare costs, hospitals may change their approach to providing clinical testing services.  While pressure to control healthcare costs poses a risk to our Company, it also creates opportunities, such as an opportunity for increased proper utilization of testing as an efficient means to manage the total cost of healthcare.  We believe that it also creates greater opportunities for high value, low-cost providers, like our Company, as compared to other providers.



Healthcare utilization. In the past few years, growth in healthcare utilization in the United States has varied.  There may be many factors contributing to this result, including sluggish employment growth, under-employment in the work force, patients delaying medical care and increased patient financial responsibility for medical care.  However, federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 contained provisions eliminating patient cost-sharing for preventive services, and additional provisions that we believe have increased the number of patients that have health insurance, including Medicaid, and thus better access to diagnostic testing.



Legislative, regulatory and policy environment.Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industry in the United States is significant and increasing; healthcare payment reform is a top issue.  The FDA has announced guidance initiatives that may impact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing regulation of laboratory-developed tests ("LDTs").  Federal healthcare reform legislation adopted in 2010 has created significant uncertainty as healthcare markets react to changes.  For example, approximately half of the states have opted in to Medicaid expansion and employers may discontinue offering group health insurance to their employees, shifting more people to exchange products.



Globalization.There is a growing demand for healthcare services in emerging market countries. Opportunities are arising to participate in the restructuring or growth of the healthcare systems outside the United States.  Demographic changes globally also may create opportunities.



Informatics.  The increased availability of healthcare data, including data made available as a result of next generation DNA sequencing, and the increased ability to effectively analyze that data at population and patient levels, is impacting healthcare practices.  Informatics, including integrated diagnostic and decision support solutions, use of population data and healthcare information technology, is spurring advances in precision medicine, including medical decision making and value, for populations and individuals.  Healthcare market participants, including pharmaceutical companies, health plans, physicians, ACOs and hospitals, are striving to leverage interoperability, informatics and analytics to positively influence the health of patient populations.



Customers.We provide diagnostic information services to a broad range of customers, including physicians, hospitals, IDNs, ACOs, health plans, patients and employers. In many cases, the customer that orders the services is not responsible to pay for them. Depending on the billing arrangement and applicable law, the payer may be the patient or a third party; in some cases, even if a third party is primarily responsible for payment, patients may bear responsibility for a portion of the payment.  Examples of potential third-party payers include health plans, self-insured employer benefit funds, ACOs, IDNs patient-centered medical homes, the traditional Medicare or Medicaid program, physicians or others (e.g., a hospital, another laboratory or an employer).  In light of health care reform, there is increased market activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models.  Increasingly, patients are bearing responsibility for some portion of the payment for the services we provide to them.











Health plans.Health plans, including managed care organizations and other health insurance providers, typically reimburse us as a contracted provider on behalf of their members for diagnostic information services performed. Reimbursement from our five largest health plans totaled less than 20%, and no one health plan accounted for 10%, of our consolidated net revenues in 2014.



Health plans typically negotiate directly or indirectly with a number of diagnostic information services providers, and represent approximately one-half of our total clinical testing volumes and one-half of our net revenues from diagnostic information services.  The trend of consolidation among health plans has continued. In certain locations, health plans may delegate to independent physician associations (“IPAs”) or other alternative delivery systems (e.g., physician hospital organizations, ACOs and patient-centered medical homes) the ability to negotiate for diagnostic information services on behalf of certain members.



Health plans and IPAs often require that diagnostic information services providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing such services through capitated payment arrangements and discounted fee-for-service arrangements. Under capitated payment arrangements, we provide services at a predetermined monthly reimbursement rate for each covered member, generally regardless of the number or cost of services provided by us.  Health plans offer preferred provider organization (“PPO”) plans, point-of-service (“POS”) plans, consumer driven health plans (“CDHPs”), high deductible plans and other coverage programs. Reimbursement under these programs is typically negotiated on a fee-for-service basis.



Most of our agreements with major health plans are non-exclusive arrangements. Certain health plans have limited their diagnostic information services network to only a single national provider, seeking to obtain improved pricing. Health plans also are narrowing their provider networks.



We are also sometimes a member of a “complementary network.” A complementary network generally is a set of contractual arrangements that a third party will maintain with various providers that provide discounted fees for the benefit of its customers. A member of a health plan may choose to access a non-contracted provider that is a member of a complementary network; if so, the provider will be reimbursed at a rate negotiated by the complementary network.



We attempt to strengthen our relationships with health plans and increase the volume of our services for their members by offering to health plans services and programs that leverage our Company's expertise and resources, including our superior access, extensive test menu, medical staff, data, IT solutions, and wellness and disease management capabilities.



Physicians.Physicians, including both primary care physicians and specialists, requiring diagnostic information services for patients are the primary referral source of our services. Physicians determine which laboratory to recommend or use based on a variety of factors, including: service; patient access and convenience, including participation in a health plan network; quality; price; IT solution integration; and depth and breadth of test and service offering.



Hospitals.Hospitals generally maintain an on-site laboratory to perform the significant majority of clinical testing for their patients and refer esoteric testing to outside service providers, which typically charge the hospitals on a negotiated fee-for-service basis. Fee schedules for hospital reference testing services often are negotiated on behalf of hospitals by group purchasing organizations. We provide services to hospitals throughout the United States, including esoteric testing services, in some cases helping manage their laboratories and serving as the medical directors of the hospital's histology or clinical laboratory, including through our Professional Laboratory Services offerings. We believe that we are the industry's leader in servicing hospitals. Hospitals generally continue to look for ways to improve profitability through cost containment or to fully utilize their existing laboratory capacity: they perform testing their patients need and may compete with non-hospital providers for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing. Continuing to obtain referrals from hospitals depends on our ability to provide high quality services that are more cost-effective than if the hospitals were to perform the services themselves.



Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community physicians by encouraging the physicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital's laboratory. In addition, hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospital's affiliated laboratory. In recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, and as a result, an increased percentage of physician practices are owned by hospitals.  Increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance physician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position.  Hospitals can have greater leverage with health insurers than do commercial clinical laboratories, particularly hospitals that have a significant market share; hospitals thus have been frequently able to negotiate higher reimbursement rates with health insurance plans than commercial clinical laboratories for comparable clinical testing services.  In light of continued pressure to reduce systemic healthcare costs, hospitals may change their approach to providing clinical









testing services.  We believe that our combination of services, including full-service esoteric testing capabilities, medical and scientific professionals available for consultation, integrated IT solutions and strong focus on quality has positioned us to be an attractive partner for hospitals, offering a full range of strategic relationships.



We also have joint venture arrangements with leading hospitals or IDNs in several metropolitan areas. These joint venture arrangements, which provide diagnostic information services for affiliated hospitals as well as for unaffiliated physicians and other local healthcare providers, serve as our principal facilities in their service areas. Typically, we have either a majority ownership interest in, or day-to-day management responsibilities for, our joint venture relationships.



IDNs and ACOs.  An IDN is a network of providers and facilities working together in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare.  An ACO is a network of providers and facilities that share financial risk in providing or arranging for the provision of healthcare.   ACOs and IDNs are increasing in number and becoming more important constituents in delivering healthcare services.  ACOs and IDNs may exercise operational and financial control over providers across the continuum of care.  ACOs and IDNs also may function as a payer.  Thus, ACOs or IDNs may be able to manage the health of a population group within a defined geography, and also may be able to influence the cost and quality of healthcare delivery, for example through owned entities and through ancillary services.  ACOs and IDNs actively are considering and adopting bundled payment models for services that they are purchasing, like diagnostic information services.  The impact of ACOs and IDNs on the provision of healthcare services to date has varied.  We are actively engaging with ACOs and IDNs to demonstrate the value that our services can provide to them.  ACOs may be encouraged to consider exclusive arrangements with health care providers that become part of the ACO, or to limit service providers to the ACO, since members of the ACO share financial risk.



Employers.Employers use tests for drugs of abuse to determine an individual's employability and his or her “fitness for duty.” Companies with high employee turnover, safety conscious environments or regulatory testing requirements provide the highest volumes of testing. Factors such as the general economy and job market can impact the utilization of drugs-of-abuse testing. We seek to grow our employer volumes through offering new and innovative programs to help companies with their goal of maintaining a safe and productive workplace. We also offer health and wellness services, including wellness testing, analytic services and on-site prevention and customized wellness services to help employers, employees and others manage healthcare costs and capitalize on trends in personalized health.



Patients.  Patients also are our customers.  In the current environment, patients are encouraged to take increased interest in and responsibility for, and often are bearing increased financial responsibility for, their healthcare.  We strive to give patients reasons to choose Quest Diagnostics, including a superior patient experience.



Other Laboratories and Other Customers. We also provide diagnostic information services on a fee-for-service basis to federal, state and local governmental agencies and to other commercial clinical laboratories.





GENERAL



Competition.While there has been significant consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry in recent years, our industry remains fragmented and highly competitive. We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliated laboratories and physician-office laboratories.  We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices and large physician group practices.  In recent years, competition from hospital-affiliated laboratories has increased.  Our largest commercial clinical laboratory competitor is Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Inc.  In addition, we compete with many smaller regional and local commercial clinical laboratories and specialized esoteric laboratories, as well as manufacturers ofin vitrodiagnostic products. In anatomic pathology, additional competitors include anatomic pathology practices, including those in academic institutions. In addition, there has been a trend among specialty physician practices to establish their own histology laboratory capabilities and/or bring pathologists into their practices, thereby reducing referrals from these practices.



We believe that healthcare providers traditionally consider a number of factors when selecting a diagnostic information services provider, including:



•service capability and quality;

•accuracy, timeliness and consistency in reporting test results;

•patient insurance coverage;

•number and type of tests performed;

•pricing;

•access to medical/scientific thought leaders for consultation;

•number, convenience and geographic coverage of patient service centers;









•reputation in the medical community;

•healthcare information technology solutions;

•qualifications of its staff; and

•ability to develop new and useful tests and services.



We believe that offering the most attractive service offering in the industry, including the most comprehensive test menu, innovative test offerings, a superior customer experience, a staff including medical and scientific experts, strong quality, unparalleled access and distribution, and data-powered integrated information technology solutions provide us with a competitive advantage.



We believe that large diagnostic information services providers may be able to increase their share of the overall diagnostic information services industry due to their large networks and lower cost structures. These advantages should enable larger providers to more effectively serve customers. In addition, we believe that consolidation in the diagnostic information services industry will continue. However, a significant portion of clinical testing is likely to continue to be performed by hospitals, which generally have affiliations with community physicians that refer testing to us.  As a result of these affiliations, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily on the basis of service capability and quality as well as pricing. In addition, market activity may increase the competitive environment. For example, health plan actions to exclude large national providers from contracts may enhance the relative competitive position of regional providers.  In addition, increased hospital acquisitions of physician practices enhance the ties of the physicians to hospital-affiliated laboratories, enhancing the competitive position of hospital-affiliated laboratories.  The formation of ACOs and IDNs, and their approach to contracts with healthcare providers, in addition to the impact of informatics, also may impact competition to provide diagnostic information services.



The diagnostic information services industry is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing.  Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.



The diagnostic products, risk assessment, clinical trials and healthcare information technology industries are highly competitive. We have many competitors, some of which have much more extensive experience in these industries and some of which have greater resources. We compete in the diagnostic products industry through unique and differentiated products. We compete in the risk assessment business by seeking to provide a superior applicant experience, faster services completion and a wider array of quality, integrated services than our competitors. We compete in the clinical trials business by leveraging our strengths as the world's leading diagnostic testing company, including the depth and breadth of our testing menu, our superior scientific expertise, our ability to support complex global clinical trials and our lab management and information technology solutions. We compete in the healthcare information technology industry by offering solutions that foster better patient care and improve performance for healthcare providers, including smaller and medium sized physician practices.



Sales and Marketing.Our Diagnostic Information Services business has a unified commercial organization focused on the sale and downstream marketing of most of our services.  It coordinates closely with our clinical franchise organizations, which are responsible for upstream marketing.  The commercial organization is centrally led, and is organized regionally, in conjunction with our operations organization, to ensure aligned delivery for our customers.  We maintain a separate sales and marketing organization for our employer drugs-of-abuse testing services.



In Diagnostic Solutions, we maintain separate sales organizations that focus on selling diagnostic products, healthcare information technology solutions, risk assessment services and clinical trials services.



Information Technology.We use information systems extensively in virtually all aspects of our business, including clinical testing, test ordering and reporting, billing, customer service, logistics and management of medical data.  We endeavor to establish systems that create value and efficiencies for our Company and customers. The successful delivery of our services depends, in part, on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems. We have taken precautionary measures to prevent problems that could affect our information technology systems.



Some of our historic growth has come through acquisitions and, as a result, we continue to use multiple information systems. We have implemented some common systems, and are planning to implement more common laboratory information and billing systems across our operations, to standardize our processes. We expect implementation will take several more years to complete, and will result in significantly more centralized systems, improved operating efficiency, more timely and comprehensive information for management and enhanced control over our operational environment.











Quality Assurance.In our Diagnostic Information Services business, our goal is to continually improve the processes for collection, handling, storage and transportation of patient specimens, as well as the precision and accuracy of analysis and result reporting. The Quest Diagnostics Quality Program includes policies and procedures to document, measure and monitor the effectiveness of laboratory operations in providing quality, improving quality and meeting the requirements of the agencies that regulate the U.S. clinical laboratory testing industry.  The Quality Program is designed so that the quality of laboratory services is monitored objectively and evaluated systematically to proactively identify opportunities to improve patient care and resolve identified problems.  We track, and seek to improve on, numerous medical quality and service metrics.



Our quality assurance efforts focus on pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic processes, including positive patient identification of specimens, report accuracy, proficiency testing, reference range relevance, process audits, statistical process control and personnel training for all of our laboratories and patient service centers. We also focus on the licensing, credentialing, training and competence of our professional and technical staff. We have implemented a specimen tracking system with global positioning system capabilities that enables us to better track specimens.  To help achieve our goal of becoming recognized as the undisputed quality leader in the diagnostics information services industry, we continue to implement initiatives to enhance our quality and standardization, using our best-in-class business performance tools.  In addition, some of our laboratories have achieved International Organization for Standardization, or ISO, certification for their quality management systems.



As part of our comprehensive quality assurance program, we utilize internal proficiency testing, extensive quality control and rigorous process audits for our diagnostic information services.  For most clinical laboratory tests, quality control samples are processed in parallel with the analysis of patient specimens. The results of tests on these quality control samples are monitored to identify trends, biases or imprecision in our analytical processes.



We participate in external proficiency testing and have accreditation or licenses for our clinical laboratory operations from various regulatory agencies or accrediting organizations, such as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), the College of American Pathologists (“CAP”) and certain states. All of our laboratories participate in various external quality surveillance programs. They include, but are not limited to, proficiency testing programs administered by CAP, as well as some state agencies. CAP is an independent, nongovernmental organization of board-certified pathologists approved by CMS to inspect clinical laboratories to determine compliance with the standards required by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act ("CLIA"). CAP offers an accreditation program to which clinical laboratories may voluntarily subscribe. All of our major regional and esoteric laboratories, including our facility in India, and most of our rapid response laboratories, are accredited by CAP. Accreditation includes on-site inspections and participation in the CAP (or equivalent) proficiency testing program. Also, our cytotechnologists and pathologists participate in an internal peer-review evaluation and one or more external individual proficiency testing programs.



Our diagnostic products businesses maintain extensive quality assurance programs focused on ensuring that our products are safe and effective and that we comply with applicable regulatory requirements in the United States and other countries. They are regulated by the FDA and are required to be in compliance with the Quality Systems Regulations, 21 CFR part 820, and with applicable standards outside the United States. In addition, our manufacturing sites are certified in accordance with ISO 13485: 2003 standards. We endeavor to design and manufacture our diagnostics products in compliance with Quality Systems Regulations.



Intellectual Property Rights.We own significant intellectual property, including patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights and trademarks in the United States and other countries. From time to time, we also license U.S. and non-U.S. patents, patent applications, technology, trade secrets, know-how, copyrights or trademarks owned by others. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business. We believe, however, that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material to our business as a whole.



Our approach is to manage our intellectual property assets, to safeguard them and to maximize their value to our enterprise. We actively defend our important intellectual property assets and pursue protection of our products, processes and other intellectual property where possible.



Our success in remaining a leading innovator in the diagnostic information services industry by continuing to introduce new tests, technology and services will depend, in part, on our ability to license new and improved technologies on favorable terms. Other companies or individuals, including our competitors, may obtain patents or other property rights on tests or processes that we may be performing, particularly in such emerging areas as gene-based testing and other specialty testing, that could prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to develop, perform or sell our tests or operate our business.











Employees.At December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 45,000 people. This total excludes employees of the joint ventures where we do not have a majority ownership interest.  We have no collective bargaining agreements with unions covering employees in the United States, and we believe that our overall relations with our employees are good.





BILLING AND REIMBURSEMENT



Billing.We generally bill for diagnostic information services on a fee-for-service basis under one of two types of fee schedules. These fees may be negotiated or discounted. The types of fee schedules are:



•“Client” fees charged to physicians, hospitals and institutions for which services are performed on a wholesale basis and which are billed on a monthly basis.

•“Patient” fees charged to individual patients and certain third-party payers on a claim-by-claim basis.



Billing for diagnostic information services is very complicated, and we maintain compliance policies and procedures for our billing. Patients, insurance companies, Medicare, Medicaid, physicians, hospitals, IDNs and employer groups all have different billing requirements. Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payers, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (e.g., disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payers; and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians). We incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to coverage, billing and reimbursement.  Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems.  Changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense. CMS establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage.



As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with federal and state healthcare reimbursement requirements. Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments resulting from non-compliance are reimbursed by us.  As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed the payers for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.



The majority of our bad debt expense is primarily the result of the failure of patients to pay the portion of the receivable that is their responsibility.  In recent years, increased patient responsibility has adversely impacted our bad debt expense.  To the extent that health plans and other programs require greater levels of patient cost-sharing, this could negatively impact our bad debt expense.  We are taking, and plan to continue to take, steps to improve our patient collection experience.



The remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions and Advance Beneficiary Notices received from healthcare providers.  In general, due to the nature of our business, historically we have performed the requested testing and reported test results regardless of whether the billing information is correct or complete. We subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information. Missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process, creates backlogs of unbilled requisitions and generally increases the aging of accounts receivable and bad debt expense. The increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information.



Government Coverage and Reimbursements.Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical test services. For example, Medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test. Physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for Medicare and Medicaid patients.



With regard to the clinical testing services performed on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries, we must bill the Medicare program directly and must accept the local Medicare carrier's fee schedule amount for covered services as payment in full. In addition, state Medicaid programs are prohibited from paying more (and in most instances, pay significantly less) than Medicare. Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, but generally does require a patient deductible for anatomic pathology services.  Certain Medicaid programs require Medicaid recipients to pay co-payment amounts for diagnostic information services.











Part B of the Medicare program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules. Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule and the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule established under that program have been subject to change, including each year.  For 2015, each schedule is changing and reimbursement under each schedule will be different in 2015 than 2014 levels.  The following table sets forth the percentage of our consolidated net revenues reimbursed under Medicare attributable to the clinical testing and physician fee schedules in 2014.

Penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business. Civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis. A parallel civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act provides for penalties on a per violation basis, plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed.



Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government. Reimbursement from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately 17% of our consolidated net revenues during 2014. Over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs.  There has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. In recent years, in an effort to control costs, states also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.





REGULATION



Our businesses are subject to or impacted by extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations in the United States (at both the federal and state levels) and the other jurisdictions in which we conduct business. These laws and regulations include regulations particular to our business, and laws and regulations relating to conducting business generally (e.g., export controls laws, U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws of other jurisdictions), including in the United States and in other jurisdictions. We also are subject to inspections and audits by governmental agencies. Set forth below are highlights of the key regulatory schemes applicable to our businesses.



CLIA and State Clinical Laboratory Licensing.All of our laboratories and, where applicable, patient service centers, are licensed and accredited as required by the appropriate federal and state agencies. CLIA regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government and comply with various technical, operational, personnel and quality requirements intended to ensure that the services provided are accurate, reliable and timely. The cost of CLIA compliance makes it cost prohibitive for many physicians to operate clinical laboratories in their offices.



CLIA does not preempt state laws that are more stringent than federal law. State laws may require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and/or proficiency testing. State laws also may require detailed review of our scientific validations and technical procedures for tests.



Fraud and Abuse.Anti-kickback laws and regulations prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to Medicare, Medicaid or certain other federal or state healthcare programs. The penalties for violation of these laws and regulations may include monetary fines, criminal and civil penalties and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal or state healthcare programs.



In addition, federal and state anti-self-referral laws generally prohibit Medicare and Medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have a personal investment in, or a compensation arrangement with, the testing laboratory.









Some states also have similar laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals and could also affect investment and compensation arrangements with physicians.



FDA.The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States. The FDA also regulates clinical trials (and, therefore, may conduct inspections related to testing that we perform for sponsors of those trials), drugs-of-abuse testing for employers, testing for blood bank purposes and testing of donors of human cells for purposes such asin vitrofertilization. A number of esoteric tests we develop internally are offered as LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.  The FDA has announced guidance initiatives that may significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing regulation of LDTs.



Our diagnostic products businesses are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as by foreign governmental agencies, under laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, advertising, marketing, distribution and post-market surveillance of diagnostic products. These regulators possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us for non-compliance, such as fines, product suspensions, submission of warning letters, recalls, product seizures, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions.



Environmental, Health and Safety.We are subject to laws and regulations related to the protection of the environment, the health and safety of employees and the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials. For example, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) has established extensive requirements relating specifically to workplace safety for healthcare employers in the U.S. This includes requirements to develop and implement multi-faceted programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens, including preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick injuries. For purposes of transportation, some biological materials and laboratory supplies are classified as hazardous materials and are subject to regulation by one or more of the following agencies: the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Public Health Service, the U.S. Postal Service and the International Air Transport Association. We generally use third-party vendors to dispose of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and radioactive materials and contractually require them to comply with applicable laws and regulations.



Physicians.Many of our pathologists enter into an employment agreement. These agreements have varying terms, but generally can be terminated at any time, upon advance notice. Most of the agreements contain covenants generally limiting the activities of the pathologist within a defined geographic area for a limited period of time after termination of employment;  the enforceability of these covenants may be limited under state law.



Our pathologists are required to hold a valid license to practice medicine in the jurisdiction in which they practice. If they provide inpatient services, they must become a member of the medical staff at the relevant hospital, with privileges in pathology.



Several jurisdictions, including some in which our businesses are located, prohibit business corporations from engaging in the practice of medicine. In certain jurisdictions, business corporations are prohibited from employing licensed healthcare professionals to provide services on behalf of the corporation; these laws vary. The manner in which licensed physicians can be organized to perform medical services may be governed by the laws of the jurisdictions in which medical services are provided and by the medical boards or other entities authorized by these jurisdictions to oversee the practice of medicine. In some jurisdictions, anatomic pathology services are delivered through physician-owned entities that employ the practicing pathologists.



Privacy and Security of Health and Personal Information.We are required to comply with laws and regulations in the United States (at the federal and state levels) and jurisdictions outside the United States in which we conduct business, including the European Union, regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information. These privacy and security laws include the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (collectively, “HIPAA”). The HIPAA security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding protected health information. The HIPAA privacy regulations establish comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information. Together, these laws and regulations establish a complex regulatory framework and may require a healthcare provider to notify individuals or the government if the provider discovers certain breaches of personal information or protected health information.  We maintain policies and practices designed to meet applicable requirements.



Drug Testing; Controlled Substances.All U.S. laboratories that perform drug testing for certain public sector employees and employees of certain federally regulated businesses are required to be certified as meeting the detailed performance and quality standards of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. To obtain access to









controlled substances used to perform drugs-of-abuse testing in the United States, laboratories must be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. All of our laboratories that perform testing described in this paragraph are certified or licensed as required.



Compliance.We seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Many of the laws and regulations applicable to us, however, including many of those relating to billing, reimbursement for tests and relationships with physicians and hospitals, are vague or indefinite or have not been interpreted by the courts. They may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require us to make changes in our operations, including our pricing and/or billing practices. The applicability or interpretation of laws and regulations also may not be clear in light of emerging changes in clinical testing science, healthcare technology and healthcare organizations. Such occurrences, regardless of their outcome, could, among other things:



•increase our administrative, billing or other operating costs;

•decrease the amount of reimbursement related to diagnostic information services performed;

•damage our reputation; or

•adversely affect important business relationships with third parties.



If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal penalties, fines, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain federal and state statutes, regulations and other laws, including thequi tamprovisions of federal and state false claims acts, allow private individuals to bring lawsuits against healthcare companies on behalf of government payers, private payers and/or patients alleging inappropriate billing practices.



The federal or state governments may bring claims based on our current practices, which we believe are lawful. The federal and state governments have substantial leverage in negotiating settlements since the amount of potential damages far exceeds the rates at which we are reimbursed, and the government has the remedy of excluding a non-compliant provider from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  We believe that, based on our experience with settlements and public announcements by various government officials, federal and state governments continue to strengthen their enforcement efforts against perceived healthcare fraud. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse provide government enforcement personnel substantially increased funding, powers, penalties and remedies to pursue suspected cases of fraud and abuse.



We have a long-standing and well-established compliance program. The Quality, Safety & Compliance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees our compliance program and requires periodic management reports regarding our compliance program. Our program includes detailed policies and procedures and training programs intended to ensure the strict implementation and observance of all applicable laws, regulations and Company policies. Further, we conduct in-depth reviews of procedures and facilities to assure regulatory compliance throughout our operations. We conduct annual training of our employees on these compliance policies and procedures.
