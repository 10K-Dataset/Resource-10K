The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.  The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, treats, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO2) and power.  It also trades around its assets, including pipelines and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.

For information regarding Occidental's current developments, segments and geographic areas, see the informationinthe "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD&A) section of this report and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Oil and Gas Operations

General

Occidental’s domestic oil and gas operations are located mainly in California, Colorado, Kansas, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and West Virginia.  International operations are located in Bahrain, Bolivia, Colombia, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.  Occidental sold its Argentine operations in February 2011 and has classified them as discontinued operations on a retrospective application basis.



ProvedReservesandSalesVolumes

The table below shows Occidental’s total oil, NGLs and natural gas proved reserves and sales volumes in 2011, 2010 and 2009.  See "MD&A — Oil and Gas Segment," and the information under the caption "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" for certain details regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, the reserves estimation process, sales and production volumes, production costs and other reserves-related data.

Comparative Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Sales VolumesOil, which includes condensate, and NGLs in millions of barrels; natural gas in billions of cubic feet; barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in millions of barrels of oil equivalent

(a)Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.  Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.  The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower over the recent past.(b)Excludes volumes from the Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.(c)Excludes the former noncontrolling interest in a Colombian subsidiary because on December 31, 2010, Occidental restructured its Colombian operations to take a direct working interest in the related assets.(d)Includes the noncontrolling interest in a Colombian subsidiary.(e)Stated on a net basis after applicable royalties.  Includes proved reserves related to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) and other similar economic arrangements of 1.0 billion BOE in 2011, 1.1 billion BOE in 2010 and 1.1 billion BOE in 2009.








CompetitionandSalesandMarketing

As a producer of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers.  Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and, in certain cases local, current and anticipated market conditions.  They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants.  Occidental’s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through strategic acquisitions and enhanced oil recovery projects in mature and underdeveloped fields.  Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively and obtain the required labor and services.



Chemical Operations

OxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 22 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile and has interests in a Brazilian joint venture.

In 2011, OxyChem announced plans to build a 182,500-ton-per-year membrane chlor-alkali plant in Tennessee, which it expects to begin operating in 2013.

OxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and foreign chemical producers.  For every product it manufactures and markets, OxyChem’s market position is first or second in the United States and first, second or third in the world.   OxyChem’s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price.

OxyChem produces the following products:
