stores, purchases and markets crude oil (including NGLs and condensate), natural
gas, carbon dioxide (CO2) and

CompetitionandSalesandMarketing

As a
producer of oil and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other
domestic and foreign private and government producers.  Oil and
natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and, in
certain cases, local conditions of supply and demand and are sold at "spot" or
contract prices or through the futures markets to refiners and other market
participants.  Occidental competes by developing and producing its
worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively and acquiring rights to explore
and develop in areas with known oil and gas deposits.  Occidental alsocompetes
by increasing production through enhanced oil recovery projects in mature and
underdeveloped fields and making strategic acquisitions.



Chemical Operations

manufactures and markets basic chemicals, vinyls and other
chemicals.

OxyChem
owns and operates manufacturing plants at 22 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia,
Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania
