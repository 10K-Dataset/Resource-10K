The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas. The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO2) and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.For information regarding Occidental's segments, geographic areas of operation and current developments, including strategies and actions related thereto, see the information in the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD&A) section of this report and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.







OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS

General

Occidental’s domestic upstream oil and gas operations are located in New Mexico and Texas. International operations are located in Bolivia, Colombia, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).



Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes

The table below shows Occidental’s total oil, NGLs and natural gas proved reserves and sales volumes in2016,2015and2014. See "MD&A — Oil and Gas Segment," and the information under the caption "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" for certain details regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, the reserves estimation process, sales and production volumes, production costs and other reserves-related data.



Competition

As a producer of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers. Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and local, current and anticipated market conditions. Occidental competes for transportation capacity and infrastructure for the delivery of its products. They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants. Occidental’s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through developing conventional and unconventional fields, utilizing primary and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques and strategic acquisitions in areas where Occidental has a competitive advantage as a result of its current successful operations or investments in shared infrastructure. Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively, maintain a skilled workforce and obtain quality services.







Comparative Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes

Oil, which includes condensate, and NGLs are in millions of barrels; natural gas is in billions of cubic feet (Bcf); barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) are in millions.

Note:The detailed proved reserves information presented in accordance with Item 1202(a)(2) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is provided under the heading "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information". Proved reserves are stated on a net basis after applicable royalties.

(a)Excludes proved reserves and sales volumes for Occidental's California oil and gas operations, which were transferred to California Resources Corporation (California Resources) in November 2014, and has been treated as discontinued operations.

(b)Natural gas volumes are converted to BOE at six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas per one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in2016, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were$43.32per barrel and$2.42per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of 18 to 1.












CHEMICAL OPERATIONSGeneralOxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 23 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile. In early 2014, OxyChem, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility. The cracker remains on budget and on schedule and is expected to begin operating in early 2017. OxyChem has announced a $145 million expansion of its manufacturing plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The project will produce an OxyChem patented new raw material used in making next-generation, climate-friendly refrigerants with a low global warming andozone depletion potential. Construction work has begun with an anticipated completion date in late 2017.CompetitionOxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and foreign chemical producers. OxyChem’s market position was first or second in the United States in 2016 for the principal basic chemical’s products it manufactures and markets as well as for Vinyl Chloride Monomer (VCM). OxyChem ranks in the top three producers of Poly Vinyl Chloride (PVC) in the United States. OxyChem’s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price.

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING OPERATIONSGeneralOccidental's midstream and marketing operations primarily support and enhance its oil and gas and chemicals businesses and also provide similar services for third parties.CompetitionOccidental's midstream and marketing businesses operate in competitive and highly regulated markets. Occidental's domestic pipeline business competes with other midstream transportation companies to provide transportation services. The competitive strategy ofOccidental's domestic pipeline business is to ensure that its pipeline and gathering systems connect various production areas to multiple market locations. Transportation rates are regulated and tariff-based. Other midstream and marketing operations also support Occidental's domestic and international oil and gas and chemical operations. Occidental's marketing business competes with other market participants on exchange platforms and through other bilateral transactions with direct counterparties. Occidental maximizes the value of its transportation and storage assets by marketing its own and third-party production in the oil and gas business.
