CompetitionandSalesandMarketing

As a producer of oil and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers.  Oil and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and, in certain cases local, current and anticipated market conditions.  They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants.  Occidental competes by developing and producing its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively and acquiring rights to explore, develop and produce in areas with known oil and gas deposits.  Occidental also competes by increasing production through enhanced oil recovery projects in mature and underdeveloped fields and making strategic acquisitions.
