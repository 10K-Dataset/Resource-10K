The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas. The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls. The midstream and marketing segment purchases, markets, gathers, processes, transports and stores oil, condensate, NGL, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO2) and power. It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity. Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.For information regarding Occidental's segments, geographic areas of operation and current developments, including strategies and actions related thereto, see the information in the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD&A) section of this report and Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS

General

Occidental’s domestic upstream oil and gas operations are located in Texas and New Mexico. International operations are located in Colombia, Oman, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar.



Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes

The table below shows Occidental’s total oil, NGL and natural gas proved reserves and sales volumes in2018,2017and2016. See "MD&A — Oil and Gas Segment," and the information under the caption "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" for certain details regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, the reserves estimation process, sales and production volumes, production costs and other reserves-related data.



Competition

As a producer of oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and international public, private, and government producers. Oil, NGL and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and local, current and anticipated market conditions. Occidental competes for transportation capacity and infrastructure for the delivery of its products, which are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants. Occidental’s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through developing conventional and unconventional fields, utilizing primary and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques and strategic acquisitions in areas where Occidental has a competitive advantage as a result of its current successful operations or investments in shared infrastructure. Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves safely and cost-effectively, maintain a skilled workforce and obtain quality services.





Comparative Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes



Oil (which includes condensate) and NGL are in millions of barrels; natural gas is in billions of cubic feet (Bcf); barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) are in millions.



Note:The detailed proved reserves information presented in accordance with Item 1202(a)(2) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is provided under the heading "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information". Proved reserves are stated on a net basis after applicable royalties.

(a)Natural gas volumes are converted to barrels of oil equivalence (BOE) at six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas per one barrel of oil. Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence. The price of natural gas on a BOE basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years. For example, in2018, the average daily prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $64.77 per barrel and $2.97 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 20 to 1.












CHEMICAL OPERATIONSGeneralOxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 22 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Tennessee and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile. In 2018, OxyChem achieved a full year of operations at the 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside, Texas facility as well as the 4CPe unit at OxyChem’s Geismar, Louisiana site.  The ethylene cracker, a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., began commercial operations in the first quarter of 2017.CompetitionOxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and international chemical producers. OxyChem’s market position was first or second in the United States in 2018 for the principal basic chemicals products it manufactures and markets as well as for vinyl chloride monomer (VCM). OxyChem ranks in the top three producers of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in the United States. OxyChem’s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price.

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING OPERATIONSGeneralOccidental's midstream and marketing operations primarily support and enhance its oil and gas and chemical businesses and also provide similar services for third parties.In 2018, Occidental sold  several non-core assets, including the Centurion common carrier oil pipeline and storage system, Southeast New Mexico oil gathering system and Ingleside Crude Terminal. Following the transactions, Occidental retained its long-term flow assurance, pipeline takeaway and export capacity through its retained marketing business.Also within the midstream and marketing segment is Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV). OLCV seeks to capitalize on Occidental’s EOR leadership by developing carbon capture, utilization and storage projects that source anthropogenic carbon dioxide and promote innovative technologies that drive cost efficiencies and economically grow Occidental’s business while reducing emissions.CompetitionOccidental's midstream and marketing businesses operate in competitive and highly regulated markets. Occidental's marketing business competes with other market participants on exchange platforms and through other bilateral transactions with direct counterparties.
