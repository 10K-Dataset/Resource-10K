See "MD&A — Oil and Gas Segment," and the information under the caption "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" for certain details regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, the reserves estimation process, sales and production volumes, production costs and other reserves-related data.









Comparative Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes



Oil, which includes condensate, and NGLs in millions of barrels; natural gas in billions of cubic feet (Bcf); barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in millions.

Note:The detailed proved reserves information presented in accordance with Item 1202(a)(2) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is provided on pages 75-78.

(a)Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.  Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.  The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower over the recent past.  For example, in 2012, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $94.21 per barrel and $2.81 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 30.

(b)Excludes volumes from the Argentine operations sold in February 2011 and classified as discontinued operations.

(c)Reserves exclude the former noncontrolling interest in a Colombian subsidiary because, on December 31, 2010, Occidental restructured its Colombian operations to take a direct working interest in the related assets.  The 2010 sales volumes include the noncontrolling interest in the Colombian subsidiary, while the 2012 and 2011 sales volumes exclude such amounts.

(d)Stated on a net basis after applicable royalties.  Includes proved reserves related to production-sharing contracts (PSCs) and other similar economic arrangements of 0.9 billion BOE in 2012, 1.0 billion BOE in 2011 and 1.1 billion BOE in 2010.












CompetitionAs a producer of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers.  Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and, in certain cases local, current and anticipated market conditions.  They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants.  Occidental’s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through developing conventional and unconventional mature and underdeveloped fields, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects and strategic acquisitions.  Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively and obtain qualified labor and services.CHEMICAL OPERATIONSGeneralOxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 22 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile. It also has an interest in a Brazilian joint venture.CompetitionOxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and foreign chemical producers.  For every product it manufactures and markets, OxyChem’s market position was first or second in the United States and first, second or third in the world in 2012.  OxyChem’s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price.OxyChem produces the following products:
