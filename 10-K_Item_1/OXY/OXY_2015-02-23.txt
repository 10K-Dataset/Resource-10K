GENERAL

Occidental’s principal businesses consist of three segments.  The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGLs) and natural gas.  The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.  The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO2) and power.  It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and power.  Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.

On November 30, 2014, the spin-off of Occidental's California oil and gas operations and related assets was completed through the pro rata distribution of 81.3 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of California Resources Corporation (California Resources) to holders of Occidental common stock creating an independent, publicly traded company. The statements of income and cash flows, and supplemental oil and gas information related to California Resources have been treated as



discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The assets and liabilities of California Resources were removed from Occidental's consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2014. Additional information related to the spin-off can be found in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

ProvedReservesandSalesVolumes

The table below shows Occidental’s total oil, NGLs and natural gas proved reserves and sales volumes in 2014, 2013 and 2012.  See "MD&A — Oil and Gas Segment," and the information under the caption "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" for certain details regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, the reserves estimation process, sales and production volumes, production costs and other reserves-related data.









Comparative Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes



Oil, which includes condensate, and NGLs are in millions of barrels; natural gas is in billions of cubic feet (Bcf); barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) are in millions.

Note:The detailed proved reserves information presented in accordance with Item 1202(a)(2) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is provided under the heading "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information".  Proved reserves are stated on a net basis after applicable royalties.

(a)Natural gas volumes are converted to BOE at six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas per one barrel of oil.  Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.  The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.  For example, in 2014, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $93.00 per barrel and $4.34 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 20 to 1.

(b)Excludes proved reserves and sales volumes for California Resources which have been classified as discontinued operations.














CompetitionAs a producer of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers.  Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and local, current and anticipated market conditions. Occidental competes for transportation capacity and infrastructure for the delivery of its products. They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants.  Occidental’s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through developing conventional and unconventional fields, utilizing primary and enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques and strategic acquisitions in areas where Occidental has a competitive advantage as a result of its current successful operations or investments in shared infrastructure. Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively, maintain a skilled workforce and obtain quality services.



CHEMICAL OPERATIONSGeneralOxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 23 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile. In early 2014, OxyChem began operating a 182,500 ton-per-year chlor-alkali plant in Tennessee and, through a 50/50 joint venture with Mexichem S.A.B. de C.V., broke ground on a 1.2 billion pound-per-year ethylene cracker at the OxyChem Ingleside facility.   The cracker is expected to begin operating in 2017.CompetitionOxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and foreign chemical producers.  OxyChem’s market position was first or second in the United States in 2014 for the principal products it manufactures and markets.  OxyChem’s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price.OxyChem produces the following products:

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING OPERATIONSGeneralOccidental's midstream and marketing operations primarily support and enhance its oil and gas and chemicals businesses and also provide similar services for third parties.CompetitionOccidental's midstream and marketing businesses operate in competitive and highly regulated markets.  Occidental's domestic pipeline business competes with other midstream transportation companies to provide transportation services.  The competitive strategy of Occidental's domestic pipeline business is to ensure thatits pipeline and gathering systems connect various production areas to multiple market locations.  Transportation rates are regulated and tariff-based. Occidental maximizes the value of its transportation and storage assets by marketing its own and third-party production in the oil and gas business.  Other midstream and marketing operations also support Occidental's domestic and international oil and gas and chemical operations.  Occidental's marketing business competes with other market participants on exchange platforms and through other bilateral transactions with direct counterparties.
