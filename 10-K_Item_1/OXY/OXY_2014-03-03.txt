ITEMS 1 AND 2BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

In this report, "Occidental" means Occidental Petroleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (OPC), or OPC and one or more entities in which it owns a controlling interest (subsidiaries).  Occidental conducts its operations through various subsidiaries and affiliates.  Occidental’s executive offices are located at 10889 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles, California 90024; telephone (310) 208-8800.GENERALOccidental’s principal businesses consist of three segments.  The oil and gas segment explores for, develops and produces oil and condensate, natural gas liquids (NGL) and natural gas.  The chemical segment (OxyChem) mainly manufactures and markets basic chemicals and vinyls.  The midstream, marketing and other segment (midstream and marketing) gathers, processes, transports, stores, purchases and markets oil, condensate, NGLs, natural gas, carbon dioxide (CO2) and power.  It also trades around its assets, including transportation and storage capacity, and trades oil, NGLs, gas and other commodities.  Additionally, the midstream and marketing segment invests in entities that conduct similar activities.



For information regarding Occidental's segments, geographic areas of operation and current developments, including its recent strategic review and actions, see the information in the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" (MD&A) section of this report and Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.OIL AND GAS OPERATIONSGeneralOccidental’s domestic oil and gas operations are located in California, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas.  International operations are located in Bahrain, Bolivia, Colombia, Iraq, Libya, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Yemen.ProvedReservesandSalesVolumesThe table below shows Occidental’s total oil, NGLs and natural gas proved reserves and sales volumes in 2013, 2012 and 2011.  See "MD&A — Oil and Gas Segment," and the information under the caption "Supplemental Oil and Gas Information" for certain details regarding Occidental’s proved reserves, the reserves estimation process, sales and production volumes, production costs and other reserves-related data.









Comparative Oil and Gas Proved Reserves and Sales Volumes



Oil, which includes condensate, and NGLs in millions of barrels; natural gas in billions of cubic feet (Bcf); barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in millions.

Note:The detailed proved reserves information presented in accordance with Item 1202(a)(2) to Regulation S-K under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is provided on pages 78-81.  Proved reserves are stated on a net basis after applicable royalties.

(a)Natural gas volumes have been converted to BOE based on energy content of six thousand cubic feet (Mcf) of gas to one barrel of oil.  Barrels of oil equivalence does not necessarily result in price equivalence.  The price of natural gas on a barrel of oil equivalent basis is currently substantially lower than the corresponding price for oil and has been similarly lower for a number of years.  For example, in 2013, the average prices of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil and New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) natural gas were $97.97 per barrel and $3.66 per Mcf, respectively, resulting in an oil to gas ratio of over 25.














CompetitionAs a producer of oil and condensate, NGLs and natural gas, Occidental competes with numerous other domestic and foreign private and government producers.  Oil, NGLs and natural gas are commodities that are sensitive to prevailing global and, in certain cases local, current and anticipated market conditions.  They are sold at current market prices or on a forward basis to refiners and other market participants.  Occidental’s competitive strategy relies on increasing production through developing conventional and unconventional mature and underdeveloped fields, enhanced oil recovery (EOR) projects and strategic acquisitions.  Occidental also competes to develop and produce its worldwide oil and gas reserves cost-effectively, maintain a skilled workforce and obtain quality services.



CHEMICAL OPERATIONSGeneralOxyChem owns and operates manufacturing plants at 22 domestic sites in Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas and at two international sites in Canada and Chile. During 2013 OxyChem sold its interest in a Brazilian joint venture.  OxyChem expects to begin operating a 182,000-ton-per-year chlor-alkali plant in Tennessee during early 2014.CompetitionOxyChem competes with numerous other domestic and foreign chemical producers.  For every product it manufactures and markets, OxyChem’s market position was first or second in the United States in 2013.  OxyChem’s competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products in order to compete on price.OxyChem produces the following products:

MIDSTREAM AND MARKETING OPERATIONSGeneralOccidental's midstream and marketing operations primarily support and enhance its oil and gas and chemicals businesses and also provide similar services for third parties.CompetitionOccidental's midstream and marketing businesses operate in competitive and highly regulated markets.  Occidental's domestic pipeline business competes with other midstream transportation companies to provide transportation services.  The competitive strategy ofOccidental's domestic pipeline business is to ensure that its pipeline and gathering systems connect various production areas to multiple market locations.  Transportation rates are regulated and tariff-based.  In marketing its own and third-party production in the oil and gas business, Occidental strives to maximize realized value using its assets, including transportation and storage capacity.  Other midstream and marketing operations also support Occidental's domestic and international oil and gas and chemical operations and include limited commodity trading.  Occidental's marketing and trading business competes with other market participants on exchanges and through other bilateral transactions.
