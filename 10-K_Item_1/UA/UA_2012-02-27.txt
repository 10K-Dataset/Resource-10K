ITEM 1.BUSINESS

General

Our principal business activities are the development, marketing and distribution of branded performance apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. The brand’s moisture-wicking
fabrications are engineered in many designs and styles for wear in nearly every climate to provide a performance alternative to traditional products. Our products are sold worldwide and are worn by athletes at all levels, from youth to professional,
on playing fields around the globe, as well as by consumers with active lifestyles.

Our net revenues are generated primarily
from the wholesale distribution of our products to national, regional, independent and specialty retailers. We also generate net revenue from product licensing and from the sale of our products through our direct to consumer sales channel, which
includes sales through our factory house and specialty stores and websites. Our products are offered in over twenty five thousand retail stores worldwide. A large majority of our products are sold in North America; however we believe that our
products appeal to athletes and consumers with active lifestyles around the globe. Internationally, we sell our products in certain countries in Europe, a third party licensee sells our products in Japan, and distributors sell our products in other
foreign countries. In addition, we opened our first store in China in 2011. We plan to continue to grow our business over the long term through increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories, expansion of our wholesale distribution, growth
in our direct to consumer sales channel and expansion in international markets. Virtually all of our products are manufactured by unaffiliated manufacturers operating in 16 countries outside of the United States.

We were incorporated as a Maryland corporation in 1996. As used in this report, the terms “we,”
“our,” “us,” “Under Armour” and the “Company” refer to Under Armour, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. We have registered trademarks around the globe, including UNDER ARMOUR®, HEATGEAR®, COLDGEAR®, ALLSEASONGEAR®and the Under Armour UA Logo, and we have applied to register many other trademarks. This Annual Report on Form 10-K
also contains additional trademarks and tradenames of our Company. All trademarks and tradenames appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are the property of their respective holders.

Products

Our product offerings consist of
apparel, footwear and accessories for men, women and youth. We market our products at multiple price levels and provide consumers with products that we believe are a superior alternative to traditional athletic products. In 2011, sales of apparel,
footwear and accessories represented 76%, 12% and 9% of net revenues, respectively. Licensing arrangements for the sale of our products represented the remaining 3% of net revenues. Refer to Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for net
revenues by product.

Apparel

Our apparel is offered in a variety of styles and fits intended to enhance comfort and mobility, regulate body temperature and improve performance regardless of weather conditions. Our apparel is
engineered to replace traditional non-performance fabrics in the world of athletics and fitness with performance alternatives designed and merchandised along gearlines. Our three gearlines are marketed to tell a very simple story about our highly
technical products and extend across the sporting goods, outdoor and active lifestyle markets. We market our apparel for consumers to choose HEATGEAR®when it is hot, COLDGEAR®when it is cold and ALLSEASONGEAR®between the extremes. Within each gearline our apparel comes in three primary
fit types: compression (tight fit), fitted (athletic fit) and loose (relaxed).







HEATGEAR®is designed to be worn in warm to hot temperatures under equipment or as a single layer. Our first compression T-shirt was the original HEATGEAR®product and remains one of our signature styles. While a sweat-soaked traditional non-performance T-shirt can weigh
two to three pounds, HEATGEAR®is engineered with a microfiber blend designed to wick moisture from the body
which helps the body stay cool, dry and light. We offer HEATGEAR®in a variety of tops and bottoms in a broad
array of colors and styles for wear in the gym or outside in warm weather.

Because athletes sweat in cold
weather as well as in the heat, COLDGEAR®is designed to wick moisture from the body while circulating body heat
from hot spots to help maintain core body temperature. Our COLDGEAR®apparel provides both dryness and warmth in
a single light layer that can be worn beneath a jersey, uniform, protective gear or ski-vest, and our COLDGEAR®outerwear products protect the athlete, as well as the coach and the fan from the outside in. Our COLDGEAR®products generally sell at higher prices than our other gearlines.

ALLSEASONGEAR®is designed to be worn in changing temperatures and uses technical fabrics to keep the wearer cool and dry in warmer
temperatures while preventing a chill in cooler temperatures.

Footwear

We began offering footwear for men, women and youth in 2006, and each year we have expanded our footwear offerings. Our footwear offerings
include football, baseball, lacrosse, softball and soccer cleats, slides, performance training footwear, running footwear, basketball footwear and new in 2011, hunting boots. Our footwear is light, breathable and built with performance attributes
for athletes. Our footwear is designed with innovative technologies which provide stabilization, directional cushioning and moisture management engineered to maximize the athlete’s comfort and control.

Accessories

During 2011, we began selling hats and bags in house. Previously these products were sold by one of our licensees. In addition, our accessories include baseball batting, football, golf and running gloves.
Our accessories include HEATGEAR®and COLDGEAR®technologies and are designed with advanced fabrications to provide the same level of performance as our other products. Net revenues generated from the sale of
gloves, and beginning in 2011, from the sale of hats and bags, are included in our accessories category.

We also have
agreements with our licensees to develop Under Armour accessories. Our product, marketing and sales teams are actively involved in all steps of the design process in order to maintain brand standards and consistency. During 2011, our licensees
offered socks, team uniforms, baby and kids’ apparel, eyewear and custom-molded mouth guards that feature performance advantages and functionality similar to our other product offerings. License revenues generated from the sale of these
accessories are included in our net revenues.

Marketing and Promotion

We currently focus on marketing and selling our products to consumers primarily for use in athletics, fitness, training and outdoor
activities. We seek to drive consumer demand by building brand equity and awareness that our products deliver advantages that help athletes perform better.

Sports Marketing

Our marketing and promotion strategy begins with selling
our products to high-performing athletes and teams on the high school, collegiate and professional levels. We execute this strategy through outfitting agreements, professional and collegiate sponsorships, individual athlete agreements and by selling
our products directly to team equipment managers and to individual athletes. As a result, our products are seen on the field,







giving them exposure to various consumer audiences through the internet, television, magazines and live at sporting events. This exposure to consumers helps us establish on-field authenticity as
consumers can see our products being worn by high-performing athletes.

We are the official outfitter of athletic teams in
several high-profile collegiate conferences, and since 2006 we have been an official supplier of footwear to the National Football League (“NFL”). In 2010, we signed an agreement to become an official supplier of gloves to the NFL
beginning in 2011 and we are the official combine scouting partner to the NFL with the right to sell combine training apparel beginning in 2012. In addition, in 2011 we became the Official Performance Footwear Supplier of Major League Baseball, as
well as becoming a partner with the National Basketball Association (“NBA”) which allows us to market our NBA athletes in game uniforms in connection with our basketball footwear starting with the 2011/2012 season.

Internationally, we are selling our products to European soccer and rugby teams. Beginning with the 2012 season, we will provide the
Tottenham Hotspur Football Club with performance apparel, including training wear and playing kit for the Club’s First and Academy teams, together with replica product for the Club’s supporters around the world. We’re the official
technical kit supplier to the Welsh Rugby Union and have exclusive retail rights on the replica products.

We also seek to
sponsor events to drive awareness and brand authenticity from a grassroots level. We host combines, camps and clinics for many sports at regional sites across the country for male and female athletes. These events, along with the products we make,
are designed to help young athletes improve their training methods and their overall performance. We are also the title sponsor of a collection of high school All-America Games that create significant on-field product and brand exposure that
contributes to our on-field authenticity.

Media

We feature our products in a variety of national digital, broadcast, and print media outlets. We also utilize social marketing to engage consumers and promote conversation around our brand and our
products. In 2011, we significantly grew our “fan base” via social sites like Facebook and Twitter, surpassing the million-fan mark and bringing attention to our most compelling brand stories.

Retail Presentation

The
primary component of our retail marketing strategy is to increase and brand floor space dedicated to our products within our major retail accounts. The design and funding of Under Armour concept shops within our major retail accounts has been a key
initiative for securing prime floor space, educating the consumer and creating an exciting environment for the consumer to experience our brand. Under Armour concept shops enhance our brand’s presentation within our major retail accounts with a
shop-in-shop approach, using dedicated floor space exclusively for our products, including flooring, lighting, walls, displays and images.

Sales and Distribution

The majority of our sales are generated through wholesale channels which include independent and specialty retailers, institutional athletic departments, leagues and teams, national and regional sporting
goods chains and department store chains. In addition, we sell our products to independent distributors in various countries where we generally do not have direct sales operations and through licensees. Our products are offered in over twenty five
thousand retail stores worldwide.

We also sell our products directly to consumers through our own network of specialty and
factory house stores in our North American Operating Segment, and through our website operations in the United States, Canada and certain countries in Europe. These factory house stores serve an important role in our overall inventory management by
allowing us to sell a significant portion of excess, discontinued and out-of-season







products while maintaining the integrity of our brand. Through our specialty stores, consumers experience our brand first-hand and have broader access to our performance products. In 2011, sales
through our wholesale, direct to consumer and licensing channels represented 70%, 27% and 3% of net revenues, respectively.

We operate in four geographic segments: (1) North America, (2) Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”),
(3) Asia, and (4) Latin America. Each geographic segment operates predominantly in one industry: the design, development, marketing and distribution of performance apparel, footwear and accessories. While our international operating
segments are currently not material and we combine them into other foreign countries for reporting purposes, we believe that the trend toward performance products is global. We plan to continue to introduce our products and simple merchandising
story to athletes throughout the world. We are introducing our performance apparel, footwear and accessories in a manner consistent with our past brand-building strategy, including selling our products directly to teams and individual athletes in
these markets, thereby providing us with product exposure to broad audiences of potential consumers. The following table presents net sales to unrelated entities and approximate percentages of net revenues by geographic distribution for each of the
years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:

North America

North America accounted for 94% of our net sales for 2011. We sell our branded apparel, footwear and accessories in North America to approximately eighteen thousand retail stores and through our own
direct to consumer channels. In 2011, our two largest customers were, in alphabetical order, Dick’s Sporting Goods and The Sports Authority. These two customers accounted for a total of 26% of our total net revenues in 2011, and one of these
customers individually accounted for at least 10% of our net revenues in 2011.

Our direct to consumer sales are generated
primarily through our specialty and factory house stores and websites. As of December 31, 2011, we had 80 factory house stores, of which the majority is located at outlet centers on the East Coast of the United States. As of December 31,
2011, we had 5 specialty stores located near Annapolis, Maryland, Chicago, Illinois, Boston, Massachusetts, Washington, D.C. and Vail, Colorado. Consumers can purchase our products directly from our e-commerce website, www.underarmour.com.

In addition, we earn licensing income in North America based on our licensees’ sale of socks, team uniforms, baby and
kids’ apparel, eyewear and custom-molded mouth guards, as well as the distribution of our products to college bookstores and golf pro shops. In order to maintain consistent quality and performance, we pre-approve all products manufactured and
sold by our licensees, and our quality assurance team strives to ensure that the products meet the same quality and compliance standards as the products that we sell directly.

We distribute the majority of our products sold to our North American wholesale customers and our own retail stores from distribution centers of approximately 667.0 thousand square feet that we lease
and operate approximately 15 miles from our corporate headquarters in Baltimore, Maryland. In addition, we distribute our products in North America through a third-party logistics provider with primary locations in California and in
Florida. In late 2011, we began leasing a new distribution facility in California of approximately 300.0 thousand square feet which is also operated by this provider. The agreement with this provider continues until December
2013. In some instances, we arrange to have products shipped from the independent factories that manufacture our products directly to customer-designated facilities.







Other Foreign Countries

Only 6% of our net revenues were generated outside of North America in 2011. We believe the future success of our brand is dependent on developing our business outside of North America.

EMEA

We sell our
apparel, footwear and accessories to approximately four thousand retail stores and through our websites in certain European countries. We also sell our apparel, footwear and accessories to independent distributors in various European countries where
we do not have direct sales operations. In addition, we sell our branded products to soccer, running and golf clubs in the United Kingdom, soccer teams in France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Sweden, as well as First Division Rugby
clubs in France, Ireland, Italy and the United Kingdom. Beginning in 2012, we will sell the Tottenham Hotspur Football Club replica product for the Club’s supporters around the world.

We generally distribute our products to our retail customers and e-commerce consumers in EMEA through a third-party logistics provider
based out of Venlo, The Netherlands. This agreement continues until April 2013.

Asia

Since 2002 we have had a license agreement with Dome Corporation, which produces, markets and sells our branded apparel, footwear and
accessories in Japan. We are actively involved with this licensee to develop variations of our products for the different sizes, sports interests and preferences of the Japanese consumer. Our branded products are now sold in Japan to professional
sports teams, including Omiya Ardija, a professional soccer club in Saitama, Japan, as well as baseball and other soccer teams, and to over twenty five hundred independent specialty stores and large sporting goods retailers. We made a cost-based
minority investment in Dome Corporation in January 2011.

We also sell our apparel, footwear and accessories to independent
distributors in Australia and New Zealand where we do not have direct sales operations.

During 2011, we opened our first
specialty store in Shanghai, China to begin to learn about the Chinese consumer. We generally distribute our products to our retail customers in Asia through a third-party logistics provider based out of Hong Kong.

Latin America

We sell
to Latin American consumers through independent distributors in Latin American countries where we do not have direct sales operations. We generally distribute our products to these independent distributors through our distribution facilities in the
United States.

Seasonality

Historically, we have recognized a significant portion of our income from operations in the last two quarters of the
year, driven primarily by increased sales volume of our products during the fall selling season, reflecting our historical strength in fall sports, and the seasonality of our higher priced COLDGEAR®line. The majority of our net revenues were generated during the last two quarters in each of 2011, 2010 and 2009. The level of our working capital generally reflects
the seasonality and growth in our business. We generally expect inventory, accounts payable and certain accrued expenses to be higher in the second and third quarters in preparation for the fall selling season.







Product Design and Development

Our products are manufactured with technical fabrications produced by third parties and developed in collaboration with our product
development team. This approach enables us to select and create superior, technically advanced fabrics, produced to our specifications, while focusing our product development efforts on design, fit, climate and product end use.

We seek to regularly upgrade and improve our products with the latest in innovative technology while broadening our product offerings.
Our goal, to deliver superior performance in all our products, provides our developers and licensees with a clear, overarching direction for the brand and helps them identify new opportunities to create performance products that meet the changing
needs of athletes. We design products with “visible technology,” utilizing color, texture and fabrication to enhance our customers’ perception and understanding of product use and benefits.

Our product development team works closely with our sports marketing and sales teams as well as professional and
collegiate athletes to identify product trends and determine market needs. For example, these teams worked closely to identify the opportunity and market for our CHARGED COTTON®products, which are made from natural cotton but perform like our synthetic products, drying faster and wicking away moisture from the body, and our CHARGED COTTON®Storm Fleece products with a unique, water-resistant finish that repels water, without stifling airflow.

Sourcing, Manufacturing and Quality Assurance

Many of the specialty fabrics and other raw materials used in our products are technically advanced products developed
by third parties and may be available, in the short term, from a limited number of sources. The fabric and other raw materials used to manufacture our products are sourced by our manufacturers from a limited number of suppliers pre-approved by us.
In 2011, approximately 50% to 55% of the fabric used in our products came from six suppliers. These fabric suppliers have locations in Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Taiwan and the United States. We continue to seek new suppliers and believe, although
there can be no assurance, that this concentration will decrease over time. The fabrics used by our suppliers and manufacturers are primarily synthetic fabrics and involve raw materials, including petroleum based products, that may be subject to
price fluctuations and shortages. In 2011 we introduced CHARGED COTTON®products which primarily use cotton
fabrics that also may be subject to price fluctuations and shortages.

We also manufacture a limited number of apparel products on-premises in our quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop
located at one of our distribution facilities in Maryland. Through this 17,000 square-foot shop, we are able







to build and ship apparel products on tight deadlines for high-profile athletes, leagues and teams. While the apparel products manufactured in the quick turn, Special Make-Up Shop represent an
immaterial portion of our total net revenues, we believe the facility helps us to provide superior service to select customers.

Inventory Management

Inventory management is important to the financial condition and operating results of our
business. We manage our inventory levels based on any existing orders, anticipated sales and the rapid-delivery requirements of our customers. Our inventory strategy is focused on continuing to meet consumer demand while improving our inventory
efficiency over the long term by putting systems and processes in place to improve our inventory management. These systems and processes are designed to improve our forecasting and supply planning capabilities. In addition to systems and
processes, key areas of focus that we believe will enhance inventory performance are SKU rationalization, added discipline around the purchasing of product, production lead time reduction, and better planning and execution in selling of excess
inventory through our factory house stores and other liquidation channels. With regards to SKU rationalization, we anticipate a reduction of our total number of SKUs by approximately 20% from 2011 to 2012.

Our practice, and the general practice in the apparel, footwear and accessory industries, is to offer retail customers the right to
return defective or improperly shipped merchandise. As it relates to new product introductions, which can often require large initial launch shipments, we commence production before receiving orders for those products from time to time. This
can affect our inventory levels as we build pre-launch quantities.

Intellectual Property

We believe we own the internally developed material trademarks used in connection with the marketing, distribution and
sale of all our products, both domestically and internationally, where our products are currently sold or manufactured. Our major trademarks include the UA Logo and UNDER ARMOUR®, both of which are registered in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union, Japan, China and several other foreign countries in which we sell or plan to
sell our products. We also own trademark registrations for UA®, ARMOUR®, HEATGEAR®, COLDGEAR®, ALLSEASONGEAR®, PROTECT THIS HOUSE®, THE ADVANTAGE IS UNDENIABLE®, DUPLICITY®, MPZ®, BOXERJOCK®, RECHARGE®, COMBINE®, CHARGED COTTON®, MICRO G®and several other trademarks, including numerous trademarks that incorporate the term ARMOUR such as ARMOURBITE®, ARMOURLOFT®, ARMOURSTORM®, ARMOUR FLEECE®, BABY ARMOUR®, and several
others. In addition, we have applied to register numerous other trademarks including: ARE YOU FROM HERE?™, E39™ and 4D FOAM™. We also own domain names for our primary trademarks (most notably underarmour.com and ua.com) and hold
copyright registrations for several commercials, as well as for certain artwork. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks and copyrights we utilize today and those we develop in the future.
We will continue to aggressively police our trademarks and pursue those who infringe, both domestically and internationally.

We believe the distinctive trademarks we use in connection with our products are important in building our brand image and distinguishing
our products from those of others. These trademarks are among our most valuable assets. In addition to our distinctive trademarks, we also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, and we
believe our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace.

The intellectual property rights in much of the
technology, materials and processes used to manufacture our products are often owned or controlled by our suppliers. However, we seek to protect certain innovative products and features that we believe to be new, strategic and important to our
business. In 2011, we filed several patent applications in connection with certain of our products and designs that we believe offer a unique utility or function. We will continue to file patent applications where we deem appropriate to protect our
inventions and designs, and we expect the number of applications to grow as our business grows and as we continue to innovate.







Competition

The market for performance apparel, footwear and accessories is highly competitive and includes many new competitors as well as increased
competition from established companies expanding their production and marketing of performance products. The fabrics and technology used in manufacturing our products are generally not unique to us, and we do not currently own any fabric or process
patents. Many of our competitors are large apparel, footwear and sporting goods companies with strong worldwide brand recognition and significantly greater resources than us, such as Nike and adidas. We also compete with other manufacturers,
including those specializing in outdoor apparel, and private label offerings of certain retailers, including some of our customers.

In addition, we must compete with others for purchasing decisions, as well as limited floor space at retailers. We believe we have been successful in this area because of the relationships we have
developed and as a result of the strong sales of our products. However, if retailers earn higher margins from our competitors’ products, they may favor the display and sale of those products.

We believe we have been able to compete successfully because of our brand image and recognition, the performance and quality of our
products and our selective distribution policies. We also believe our focused gearline merchandising story differentiates us from our competition. In the future we expect to compete for consumer preferences and expect that we may face greater
competition on pricing. This may favor larger competitors with lower production costs per unit that can spread the effect of price discounts across a larger array of products and across a larger customer base than ours. The purchasing decisions of
consumers for our products often reflect highly subjective preferences that can be influenced by many factors, including advertising, media, product sponsorships, product improvements and changing styles.

Employees

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately fifty four hundred employees, including approximately twenty nine hundred in our factory house and specialty stores and eight hundred at our distribution
facilities. Approximately eighteen hundred of our employees were full-time. Most of our employees are located in the United States and none of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have had no labor-related
work stoppages, and we believe our relations with our employees are good.

Available Information

We will make available free of charge on or through our website at www.underarmour.com our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports
on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we file these materials with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. We also post on this website our key corporate governance documents, including our board committee charters, our corporate governance guidelines and our ethics policy.
