Form 10-K.

Overview

Incyte is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of proprietary small molecule drugs
to treat serious unmet medical needs. We began our drug discovery and development operations in 2001 and have focused our research efforts primarily in the areas of oncology and inflammation where we
believe our expertise in target selection, medicinal chemistry, and preclinical and clinical development can be most effectively leveraged.

In
2003, we initiated a research and development program to explore the inhibition of enzymes called janus associated kinases (JAK). The JAK family is composed of four tyrosine
kinases—JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2—that are involved in the signaling of a number of cytokines and growth factors. JAKs are central to a number of biologic processes, including
the formation and development of blood cells and the regulation of immune functions. Dysregulation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway has been associated with a number of diseases, including
myeloproliferative neoplasms, other hematological malignancies, solid tumors, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and other chronic inflammatory diseases. Myeloproliferative neoplasms are a closely
related group of blood diseases in which blood cells, specifically platelets, white blood cells, and red blood cells, grow or act abnormally in the bone marrow. These diseases include myelofibrosis,
polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia.

We
have discovered multiple potent, selective and orally bioavailable JAK inhibitors that are selective for JAK1 or JAK1 and JAK2. Our most advanced compound, JAKAFI®
(ruxolitinib), an oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2011 as a treatment for patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis
(MF), including primary MF, post-polycythemia vera MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. We estimate there are between 16,000 and 18,500 patients with MF in the United States. Based on the modern
prognostic scoring systems referred to as International Prognostic Scoring System and Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System, we believe intermediate and high-risk patients represent
80 percent to 90 percent of all patients with MF in the United States and encompass patients over the age of 65, or patients who have or have ever









had
any of the following: anemia, constitutional symptoms, elevated white blood cell or blast counts, or platelet counts less than 100,000 per microliter of blood.

JAKAFI
was the first FDA-approved JAK inhibitor for any indication and the first product approved for use in MF. The FDA has also granted JAKAFI orphan drug status for MF as well as
polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. The European Commission has also granted the compound orphan drug status for MF. In addition, we hold patents that cover the formulation and use of
JAKAFI through 2026, excluding potential patent term extensions.

Pursuant
to the terms of our collaboration agreement with Novartis International Pharmaceutical Ltd., Novartis received exclusive development and commercialization rights to
ruxolitinib outside of the United States for all hematologic and oncologic indications and sells ruxolitinib outside of the United States under the name JAKAVI®. In August 2012, the
European Commission approved JAKAVI for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary MF (also known as chronic idiopathic MF), post-polycythemia vera MF or
post-essential thrombocythemia MF. We have retained all development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI in the United States and are eligible to receive development and commercial milestones and
royalties from product sales outside the United States.

In
addition to its development as a treatment for MF, we believe ruxolitinib may have potential as a treatment for other cancers. Several additional clinical programs are ongoing,
including a global Phase III program in patients with advanced polycythemia vera (PV). Data from a registration trial for PV being conducted under a special protocol assessment (SPA) agreement
with the FDA, if positive, are expected to support the filing of a supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the treatment of PV patients who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea in the
first half of 2014. Top-line results from the Phase II proof-of-concept trial of ruxolitinib in patients with refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer suggest a demonstrable survival benefit in
a pre-specified subgroup of patients. The Company and the FDA have agreed on an SPA for a registration trial for advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer. Under the SPA, the Phase III trial can
be limited to the subgroup which showed positive results identified in the Phase II trial and there is no requirement to develop a companion diagnostic. The Phase III program includes a
second nearly identical Phase III trial, and both trials are expected to begin in the first half of 2014. The FDA has granted orphan status for ruxolitinib for the treatment of pancreatic
cancer.

The
subgroup from the Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer is common to many tumor types and we believe that JAK inhibition may represent a new treatment approach for other solid
tumors. To test this hypothesis, we expect to initiate three blinded proof-of-concept Phase II trials evaluating ruxolitinib in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer in the
first half of 2014. The primary endpoint for each trial will be overall survival.

We
have a second oral JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, which is subject to a collaboration agreement with Eli Lilly and Company in which Lilly received exclusive worldwide
development and commercialization rights for the compound for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We could receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global sales of products subject to
the agreement with rates ranging up to 20 percent if the products are successfully commercialized. This collaboration also contains an option for us to co-develop compounds for any inflammatory
and autoimmune disease, whereby we fund 30 percent of development costs from Phase IIb through regulatory approval for that indication in exchange for tiered royalties ranging up to the
high twenties on potential future sales. We exercised our co-development option for the development of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis in 2010. The Phase III program of baricitinib in
patients with rheumatoid arthritis is ongoing. Baricitinib is also in Phase II trials for patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis and patients with diabetic nephropathy. We have decided not
to exercise our co-development option for psoriasis.

We
have a wholly owned portfolio of JAK 1 inhibitors. Our lead JAK1 inhibitor, INCB39110, has completed proof-of-concept studies in patients with psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis and
is in an ongoing proof-of-concept study in patients with myelofibrosis. While the results of the psoriasis and rheumatoid









arthritis
studies were positive, for strategic reasons, we are planning to pursue oncologic indications with INCB39110. In addition we have a second JAK1 inhibitor, INCB47986, which we intend to
advance in chronic inflammatory conditions.

Our
oral IDO1 inhibitor, INCB24360, is being evaluated in a Phase II study as monotherapy for ovarian cancer and in a Phase I/II trial in combination with ipilimumab for
metastatic melanoma. IDO1 is an enzyme whose increased levels in multiple solid tumor types are associated with decreased survival. IDO1 inhibition shifts the immune system from an immunosuppressive
state to an activated state, allowing the body to mount a more effective anti-tumor immune response. Preclinical data suggest that IDO1 inhibition can provide anti-tumor effects both as monotherapy
and in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors, where a significant synergy has been exhibited. We have entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and
efficacy of INCB24360 in combination with Merck's investigational anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, MK-3475, in a Phase I/II study in previously treated metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung
cancer and other advanced or metastatic cancers.

We
have several other orally available small molecule compounds that are in various stages of clinical development, including a PI3K-delta inhibitor, INCB40093, which is in
Phase I clinical development in patients with B-lymphoid malignancies, and we have initiated a combination study of this compound with our JAK1 inhibitor INCB39110 in the same patient group.

We
have a number of programs in preclinical development, and we intend to continue our investment in drug discovery to expand our pipeline.

JAKAFI

JAKAFI became commercially available in the United States in November 2011 and is currently being marketed in the United States through
our own specialty sales force and our commercial team, which has relevant expertise in the promotion, distribution and reimbursement of oncology drugs.









To
help ensure that all eligible MF patients have access to JAKAFI, we have established a patient assistance program called IncyteCARES (CARES stands for Connecting to Access,
Reimbursement, Education and Support). IncyteCARES helps ensure that any patient with intermediate or high-risk MF who meets certain eligibility criteria and is prescribed JAKAFI has access to the
product regardless of ability to pay and has access to ongoing support and educational resources during treatment. In addition, IncyteCARES works closely with payers to help facilitate insurance
coverage of JAKAFI.

JAKAFI
is distributed primarily through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers and group purchasing organizations that allow for efficient delivery of the medication by mail
directly to patients or direct delivery to the patient's pharmacy of choice. Our distribution process uses a model that is well-established and familiar to physicians who practice within the oncology
field.

To
further support appropriate use and future development of JAKAFI, our Medical Affairs department is responsible for providing appropriate scientific and medical education and
information to physicians, preparing scientific presentations and publications, and overseeing the process for supporting investigator sponsored trials.

Novartis
received approval for JAKAVI in the European Union and Canada in the second half of 2012. JAKAVI is approved in more than 50 countries with additional worldwide regulatory
filings underway.

Clinical Programs

JAK1/JAK2 Programs for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Oncology and Inflammation

Myelofibrosis.Myelofibrosis is a rare, life-threatening condition. MF, considered the most serious of the myeloproliferative neoplasms,
 can occur
either as primary MF, or as secondary MF that develops in some patients who previously had polycythemia vera or essential thrombocythemia.

Most
MF patients have enlarged spleens and many suffer from debilitating symptoms, including abdominal discomfort, pruritus (itching), night sweats and cachexia (involuntary weight
loss). There were no therapies for MF until the approval of JAKAFI.

The
FDA approval was based on results from two randomized Phase III trials (COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II), which demonstrated that patients treated with JAKAFI experienced significant
reductions in splenomegaly (enlarged spleen). COMFORT-I also demonstrated improvements in symptoms. The most common hematologic adverse reactions in both trials were thrombocytopenia and anemia. These
events rarely led to discontinuation of JAKAFI treatment. The most common non-hematologic adverse reactions were bruising, dizziness and headache.

Further
analyses from the clinical program of JAKAFI were presented at the 2013 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December. Data from multiple presentations, including a
three-year follow-up analysis from COMFORT-I and a pooled analysis of the two COMFORT trials, suggest that patients treated with JAKAFI maintained reductions in spleen volume and had improved survival
over placebo and best available therapy.

Polycythemia Vera.Polycythemia vera is a rare but serious myeloproliferative neoplasm and occurs when the bone marrow produces too
many blood cells,
especially red blood cells. Patients with polycythemia vera can have symptoms similar to myelofibrosis, including enlarged spleens and debilitating symptoms such as fatigue, abdominal discomfort,
pruritus, night sweats and cachexia. While there are currently no FDA-approved therapies for polycythemia vera, several treatments are used to manage the signs and symptoms of the disease, including
the removal of blood (phlebotomy) and treatment with myelosuppressive therapies. We estimate, based on the available literature and published databases, that there are currently 100,000 patients with
polycythemia vera in the United States. Approximately 25% of patients can become resistant to or intolerant of these approaches, and there is an unmet medical need for new therapies to treat this
subset of patients.









In
September 2010, we reached an SPA agreement with the FDA for a Phase III clinical trial for ruxolitinib in patients with advanced polycythemia vera. The SPA was subsequently
amended with FDA agreement in the fourth quarter of 2011. This global, randomized, open-label trial, being conducted by Incyte and Novartis, is comparing the efficacy and safety of ruxolitinib to best
available therapy. The trial is fully enrolled with approximately 220 patients. If positive, results are expected to be part of a supplemental new drug application submission in mid-2014. Incyte is
also conducting a Phase III trial measuring disease-related symptoms in patients with PV. The FDA has granted fast track designation for polycythemia vera, specifically for the treatment of
patients with PV who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea.

Pancreatic Cancer.Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which malignant cells are found in the tissues of the pancreas. According to the
National Cancer
Institute, there were an estimated 45,000 new cases and 38,000 deaths from pancreatic cancer in the United States in 2013.

We
have completed a Phase II trial that compared ruxolitinib in combination with capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in refractory metastatic pancreatic cancer. Among a
prospectively defined subgroup of the patients, pre-selected as being most likely to benefit from JAK pathway inhibition, top-line results showed a hazard ratio for overall survival of 0.47, which
means the risk of death was reduced by approximately 50 percent for those patients treated with ruxolitinib. The subgroup represented approximately half of the randomized population in this
trial.

The
FDA has granted orphan status for ruxolitinib for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. We have also reached an SPA agreement with the FDA for a registration trial for advanced or
metastatic pancreatic cancer in the subgroup which showed the greatest benefit in the Phase II trial and under the SPA we are not required to develop a companion diagnostic. The
Phase III program, which includes a second nearly identical Phase III study, is expected to begin in the first half of 2014.

Solid Tumors.Because the subgroup identified in the Phase II trial of ruxolitinib in pancreatic cancer is common to many tumor
types, ranging
from 30 percent to 70 percent of patients, we believe JAK inhibition may represent a new treatment approach for other solid tumors. In the first half of 2014, we plan to initiate three
blinded Phase II proof-of-concept trials evaluating ruxolitinib in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer, with the primary endpoint for each trial being overall survival.

Additional Clinical Activities in Oncology.Multiple investigator-sponsored trials are ongoing to evaluate the use of ruxolitinib in
other oncologic
indications, including advanced hematologic malignancies, relapsed or refractory acute leukemia, lymphoma and breast cancer.

Rheumatoid Arthritis.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterized by aberrant or abnormal immune mechanisms that lead
to joint
inflammation and swelling and, in some patients, the progressive destruction of joints. Rheumatoid arthritis can also affect connective tissue in the skin and organs of the body.

Current
rheumatoid arthritis treatments include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate, and the newer biological
response modifiers that target pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor, implicated in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. None of these approaches to treatment is curative;
therefore, there remains an unmet need for new safe and effective treatment options for these patients. Rheumatoid arthritis is estimated to affect about 1 percent of the world population.

We
have a second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, which is the lead compound in our inflammation program and subject to our collaboration agreement with Lilly. In June 2013, 52-week
efficacy and safety data from the Phase IIb trial of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were presented at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Annual European Congress
of Rheumatology. In the initial 12-week portion of this study, baricitinib was associated with statistically significant improvements in the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis disease versus
placebo, and these responses were maintained or improved during an additional 12 weeks of blinded treatment. Among









patients
completing the open-label extension, clinical improvements observed at week 24 were sustained at the end of 52 weeks.

The
Phase III program of baricitinib in patients with rheumatoid arthritis began in October 2012 and currently includes four trials that are expected to each recruit between 500
and 1,300 patients. The four trials incorporate all three rheumatoid arthritis populations (methotrexate naïve, biologic naïve, and biologic experienced); use event rates
to fully power the baricitinib program for structural comparison and non-inferiority vs. adalimumab; incorporate an MRI sub-study into the methotrexate naïve registration trial; and
evaluate patient-reported outcomes. We have exercised our co-development option in rheumatoid arthritis to fund 30 percent of development costs from Phase IIb through regulatory approval
in exchange for increased tiered royalties ranging up to the high twenties on potential future sales.

Psoriasis.Baricitinib is also being developed in psoriasis. Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes visible scaling and inflammation.
Most psoriasis
patients have patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales that can occur on the elbows, knees, other parts of the legs, scalp, lower back, face, palms, and soles of the feet. Market research
suggests that neither physicians nor patients are satisfied with existing psoriasis treatments primarily because these require constant monitoring to balance safety and efficacy outcomes. There is
clear unmet need for a better tolerated and effective treatment. The U.S. psoriasis market consists of approximately six million patients, of which moderate-to-severe patients account for
approximately 20 percent of the market.

In
December 2011, Lilly initiated a Phase IIb double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial designed to evaluate baricitinib in patients with moderate-to-severe plaque
psoriasis. The trial is fully enrolled with approximately 240 patients randomized in several dose groups. The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that at least one dose group is superior
to placebo at week 12 in the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe psoriasis as measured by the proportion of patients with at least a 75 percent improvement from baseline in Psoriasis
Area and Severity Index (PASI) score. We have decided not to exercise our co-development option for this indication, although we retain a co-promotion option.

Diabetic Nephropathy.In August 2012, Lilly initiated a Phase II trial to evaluate baricitinib in patients with diabetic
nephropathy. Data
suggest that ongoing renal inflammation plays a key role in diabetic nephropathy, and biopsies from the kidneys of early- and late-stage diabetic kidney disease patients suggest that over-activation
of the JAK/STAT pathway leads to increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Therefore, inhibiting cytokine pathways dependent on JAK1 and JAK2 may lead to positive clinical outcomes in diabetic
nephropathy.

In
this dose-ranging placebo-controlled Phase II trial, which is expected to include 250 patients, the primary endpoint is the change from baseline in the urinary
albumin/creatinine ratio at 24 weeks. Results are expected in 2014. We retain co-development and co-promotion options for this indication.

JAK1 Programs for Oncology and Inflammation

Solid Tumors.We have a wholly owned portfolio of JAK1 inhibitors, and we are planning to pursue oncologic indications with our lead
JAK1 inhibitor,
INCB39110. We are conducting a Phase I clinical
trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of our JAK1 inhibitor INCB39110 in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, and we plan to initiate two placebo-controlled
proof-of-concept Phase II trials of INCB39110 in distinct chemotherapeutic regimens in patients with non-small cell lung cancer in early 2014.

Chronic Inflammatory Conditions.In 2013, we completed proof-of-concept studies of INCB39110 in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, and
results
showed that the JAK1 inhibitor improved efficacy by multiple measures as compared to placebo, and it was generally well-tolerated without evidence of myelosuppression. We are advancing a second JAK1
inhibitor, INCB47986, in chronic inflammatory conditions and expect to initiate a Phase II trial in rheumatoid arthritis in the first half of 2014.









IDO1 for Solid Tumors

The enzyme, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase-1, IDO1, is a key regulator of the mechanisms that are responsible for allowing tumors to
escape from a patient's immune surveillance. IDO1 expression by tumor cells, or by antigen presenting cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells in tumors, creates an environment in which tumor
specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes are rendered functionally inactive or are no longer able to attack a patient's cancer cells. By inhibiting IDO1, it is proposed that this "brake" on the anti-tumor
immune response is removed, allowing anti-tumor specific cytotoxic T cells, generated in a patient spontaneously in response to the tumor, or through a therapy designed to stimulate the immune
response, to have greater anti-tumor efficacy.

We
believe our compound, INCB24360, represents a novel, potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme IDO1. It is efficacious in multiple mouse models of cancer and has been
well-tolerated in preclinical safety studies. We completed a dose-escalation Phase I clinical trial in patients with solid tumors in early 2012 with results presented at the American Society of
Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June 2012. The preliminary findings confirmed significant IDO1 expression in various tumors, including bladder, colorectal and breast cancers. Using two independent
assays, IDO1 inhibition was observed in all patients receiving the compound, and treatment with INCB24360 resulted in greater than 90 percent inhibition of IDO1 activity when administered at
doses above 300 mg twice a day. The compound was generally well-tolerated at these doses with the most common adverse events being grade 1 and 2 fatigue.

INCB24360
is currently in Phase II clinical development as monotherapy for ovarian cancer.

Preclinical
data suggest that IDO1 inhibition can provide anti-tumor effects both as monotherapy and in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors, where a significant synergy has been
exhibited. Because IDO1 inhibition exhibits activity that is distinct from those of other checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1, IDO1 inhibition may synergize in combination with
downstream checkpoint blockade to provide a more efficacious anti-tumoral immune response. We are currently studying INCB24360 in combination with ipilimumab, a drug that targets CTLA-4, in a
Phase II trial in patients with metastatic melanoma. We have also entered into a clinical trial collaboration agreement with Merck to evaluate the safety and efficacy of INCB24360 in
combination with Merck's investigational anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, MK-3475, in a Phase I/II study in previously treated metastatic and recurrent non-small cell lung cancer and other advanced or
metastatic cancers, and we are exploring other options to study the compound in combination with other checkpoint inhibitors.

Combined JAK1/PI3K-delta Inhibition for Lymphoma

In-house preclinical studies have demonstrated that the JAK1 and PI3K-delta signaling pathways play inter-related functions in
maintaining the growth and survival of B-lymphoid cells, and the data suggest that concurrent inhibition of the two pathways may achieve synergistic cellular efficacy. We have a PI3K-delta inhibitor,
INCB40093, in the first part of a Phase I dose-escalation trial in patients with B-lymphoid malignancies, and we are initiating a safety and efficacy study of the compound in combination with
our JAK1 inhibitor INCB39110 in the same patient group.

c-MET for Solid Tumors

Solid tumors are named for the type of cells that form them, for example, sarcomas, carcinomas, and lymphomas. Frequently, the term
"solid tumors" collectively refers to cancer in major organs. The American Cancer Society estimates that more than 1,500,000 Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2011, of which more than 835,000
patients will be diagnosed with solid tumors such as lung, prostate, colon, rectum or breast cancer. The American Cancer Society also estimates that approximately 572,000 U.S. patients are expected
ultimately to die from cancer in 2011.

c-MET
is a clinically validated receptor kinase cancer target. Abnormal c-MET activation in cancer correlates with poor prognosis. Dysregulation of the c-MET pathway triggers tumor
growth, formation of









new
blood vessels that supply the tumor with nutrients, and causes cancer to spread to other organs. Dysregulation of the c-MET pathway is seen in many types of cancers, including kidney, liver,
stomach, breast and brain.

Several
small molecule c-MET kinase inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in a number of cancers; however, these molecules have limited potency and are relatively non-selective,
which could lead to off-target toxicities. We believe our lead c-MET inhibitor, INC280 (formerly INCB28060), which is licensed to Novartis, has the requisite properties to overcome these limitations,
including greater selectivity, improved potency and more effective inhibition of c-MET. Under our agreement, Novartis received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to INC280
and certain back-up compounds in all indications. Upon completion of a Phase I clinical trial in 2012, we transitioned the program to Novartis. The c-MET inhibitor is being evaluated in
hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and other solid tumors.

Early Stage Clinical / Discovery

We have a number of early programs at various stages of preclinical and clinical testing. We intend to describe these programs once we
have obtained clinical proof-of-concept and established that a compound within a specific program warrants further development.

License Agreements

Novartis

In November 2009, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novartis. Under the terms of the agreement, Novartis
received exclusive development and commercialization rights outside of the United States to ruxolitinib and certain back-up compounds for hematologic and oncology indications, including all
hematological malignancies, solid tumors and myeloproliferative diseases. We retained exclusive development and commercialization rights to JAKAFI (ruxolitinib) in the United States and in certain
other indications. Novartis also received worldwide exclusive development and commercialization rights to our c-MET inhibitor compound INCB28060 and certain back-up compounds in all indications. We
retained options to co-develop and to co-promote INCB28060 in the United States.

Under
this agreement, we received an upfront payment and immediate milestone payment totaling $210 million and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to
approximately $1.1 billion if defined development and commercialization milestones are achieved. We also could receive tiered, double-digit royalties ranging from the upper-teens to the
mid-twenties on future ruxolitinib net sales outside of the United States. In addition, should Novartis receive reimbursement and pricing approval for ruxolitinib in a specified number of countries,
we will be obligated to pay to Novartis tiered royalties in the low single digits on future ruxolitinib net sales within the United States. Each company is responsible for costs relating to the
development and commercialization of ruxolitinib in its respective territories, with costs of collaborative studies shared equally. Novartis is responsible for all costs relating to the development
and commercialization of the c-MET inhibitor compound after the initial Phase I clinical trial, which has been completed.

The
Novartis agreement will continue on a program-by-program basis until Novartis has no royalty payment obligations with respect to such program or, if earlier, the termination of the
agreement or any program in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Royalties are payable by Novartis on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest to occur of
(1) the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights covering the licensed product in the relevant country, (2) the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for the
licensed product in such country and (3) a specified period from first commercial sale in such country of the licensed product by Novartis or its affiliates or sublicensees. The agreement may
be terminated in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis by Novartis for convenience. The agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain other circumstances, including material
breach.









Lilly

In December 2009, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement with Lilly. Under the terms of the agreement,
Lilly received exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights to baricitinib and certain back-up compounds for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. We received an initial payment of
$90 million, and were initially eligible to receive additional payments of up to $665 million based on the achievement of defined development, regulatory and commercialization
milestones. We also could receive tiered, double-digit royalty payments on future global net sales with rates ranging up to 20% if the product is successfully commercialized.

Pfizer

In January 2006, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement with Pfizer Inc. for the pursuit of our CCR2
antagonist program. Pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of CCR2 antagonist compounds. Pfizer's rights extend to the full scope of potential indications,
with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides, where we retained worldwide rights, along with certain compounds. We do not have obligations to Pfizer on pre-clinical development
candidates we select for pursuit in these indications. The agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement. Prior to such expiration,
either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party. In addition, Pfizer may terminate the agreement
at any time upon 90 days' notice. We received an upfront nonrefundable, non-creditable payment of $40.0 million in January 2006 and are eligible to receive additional future development
and commercialization milestone payments.

Incyte's Approach to Drug Discovery and Development

Our productivity in drug discovery and development is primarily a result of our core competency in medicinal chemistry which is tightly
integrated with, and supported by, an experienced team of biologists with expertise in multiple therapeutic areas. We have also built a clinical development and regulatory team. This team utilizes
clinical research organizations (CROs), expert
scientific advisory boards, and leading consultants and suppliers in relevant drug development areas in an effort to conduct our clinical trials









efficiently
and effectively, while maintaining strategic control of the design and management of our programs.

To
succeed in our objective to create a pipeline of novel, orally available drugs that address serious unmet medical needs, we have established a broad range of discovery capabilities
in-house, including target validation, high-throughput screening, medicinal chemistry, computational chemistry, and pharmacological and ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion)
assessment. We augment these capabilities through collaborations with academic and contract laboratory resources with relevant expertise.

Given
our chemistry-driven discovery process, our pipeline has grown to encompass multiple therapeutic areas, primarily in the areas of oncology and inflammation. We conduct a limited
number of discovery programs in parallel at any one time. This focus allows us to allocate resources to our selected programs at a level that we believe is competitive with much larger pharmaceutical
companies. We believe this level of resource allocation, applied to the discovery process outlined above, has been a critical competitive advantage in advancing our product pipeline.

Once
our compounds reach clinical development, our objective, whenever possible, is to rapidly progress the lead candidate into a proof-of-concept Phase II clinical trial to
quickly assess the therapeutic potential of the clinical candidate itself and its underlying mechanism. This information is then used to evaluate the commercial potential of the compound, the most
appropriate indication or indications to pursue, and whether to pursue any development on our own or seek a strategic relationship for the compound.

Our
development teams are responsible for ensuring that our clinical candidates are expeditiously progressed from preclinical development and IND-enabling studies into human testing. Our
development teams include employees with expertise in drug development, including clinical trial design, statistics, regulatory affairs, medical affairs, pharmacovigilance and project management. We
have also built core internal process chemistry and formulation teams using this same strategy. Rather than build extensive infrastructure, we work with contract manufacturers with expertise in
process chemistry, product formulation, and the manufacture of clinical trial supplies to support our drug development efforts. In addition, we use external CROs for later stage clinical trials.

Incyte's Commercial Strategy

Our strategy is to develop and commercialize our compounds on our own in selected markets when we believe a company of our size can
successfully compete, such as in myelofibrosis, other myeloproliferative neoplasms and other oncology indications. In November 2011, we received regulatory approval of JAKAFI (ruxolitinib) in the
United States for the treatment of intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. Since that time, we have focused on increasing utilization of JAKAFI in this patient population. JAKAFI is distributed
primarily through a limited network of specialty pharmacy providers and group purchasing organizations. We have expanded the marketing, medical, sales and operational infrastructure to support
continued commercialization of JAKAFI in this indication and to prepare for potential future indications in the United States.

For
rights to ruxolitinib outside the United States as well as for pipeline compounds that are outside of our core expertise, would require expensive clinical studies, or could be used
in combination with other compounds, we have established or may in the future establish collaborations or strategic relationships to support development and commercialization, such as our
collaborations with Novartis and Lilly for our JAK inhibitors. We believe the key benefits to entering into strategic relationships include the potential to receive upfront payments and future
milestones and royalties in exchange for certain rights to our compounds, as well as the potential to expedite the development and commercialization of certain of our compounds.









Patents and Other Intellectual Property

We regard the protection of patents and other enforceable intellectual property rights that we own or license as critical to our
business and competitive position. Accordingly, we rely on patent, trade secret and copyright law, as well as nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual property. We
have established a patent portfolio of patents and patent applications owned by us that cover aspects of all our drug products and drug candidates. The patents and patent applications relating to our
drug products and drug candidates generally include claims directed to the compounds, methods of using the compounds, formulations of the compounds, pharmaceutical salt forms of the compounds, and
methods of manufacturing the compounds. Our policy is to pursue patent applications on inventions and discoveries that we believe are commercially
important to the development and growth of our business. The following table sets forth the status of the patents and patent applications in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, covering
our drug products and drug candidates in key programs that have progressed into at least Phase II clinical trials:

Drug/Drug Candidate (Target)Status of United States Patent Estate(Earliest Anticipated Expirations,Subject to Potential Extensionsand Payment of Maintenance Fees)Status of European Unionand Japan Patent Estate(Earliest Anticipated Expirations,Subject to Potential Extensionsand Payment of Maintenance Fees)ruxolitinib (JAK)Granted and pending (2026)Granted and pending (2026)baricitinib (JAK)Granted and pending (2029)Granted and pending (2029)INCB24360 (IDO)Granted and pending (2029)Applications pending (2029)INCB39110 (JAK)Applications pending (2031)Applications pending (2031)INCB28060 (cMET)Granted and pending (2027)Granted and pending (2027)

Patents
extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual
protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.

We
may seek to license rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs. Under these licenses, we may be required to pay up-front fees,
license fees, milestone payments and royalties on sales of future products.

Although
we believe our rights under patents and patent applications provide a competitive advantage, the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are highly
uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We may not be able to develop patentable products or processes, and may not be able to obtain patents in the United States or elsewhere from
pending applications.
Even if patent claims are allowed, the claims may not issue, or in the event of issuance, may not be valid or enforceable or may not be sufficient to protect the technology owned by or licensed to us
or provide us with a competitive advantage. Any patent or other intellectual property rights that we own or obtain may be circumvented, challenged or invalidated by our competitors. Others may have
patents that relate to our business or technology and that may prevent us from marketing our drug candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. In addition, litigation or other
proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement, to enforce patents, to protect our other intellectual property rights, to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary
rights of third parties or to defend ourselves in patent or other intellectual property right suits brought by third parties. We could incur substantial costs in such litigation or other proceedings.
An adverse outcome in any such litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liability.

With
respect to proprietary information that is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents are difficult to enforce, we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality
agreements to protect our interests. While we require all employees, consultants and potential business partners to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our
trade secrets or other proprietary









information.
Others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.

Competition

Our drug discovery, development and commercialization activities face, and will continue to face, intense competition from
organizations such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. We face significant competition from organizations,
particularly fully integrated pharmaceutical companies, that are pursuing pharmaceuticals that are competitive with JAKAFI and our drug candidates.

Many
companies and institutions, either alone or together with their collaborative partners, have substantially greater financial resources, larger drug discovery, development and
commercial staffs and significantly greater experience than we do in:

•drug discovery;•developing products;•undertaking preclinical testing and clinical trials;•obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products; and•manufacturing, marketing, distributing and selling products.

Accordingly,
our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving FDA and other regulatory approval or commercializing products that compete with JAKAFI or our drug
candidates.

In
addition, any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have long histories of safe and effective use. Competition may also arise
from:

•other drug development technologies and methods of preventing or reducing the incidence of disease;•new small molecules; or•other classes of therapeutic agents.

We
face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for establishing relationships
with academic and research institutions and for licenses to proprietary technology. These competitors, either alone or with their collaborative partners, may succeed in developing products that are
more effective than ours.

Our
ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our ability to:

•develop proprietary products;•develop and maintain products that reach the market first, are technologically superior to and/or are of lower cost than
other products in the market;•attract and retain scientific, product development and sales and marketing personnel;•obtain patent or other proprietary protection for our products and technologies;•obtain required regulatory approvals; and•manufacture, market, distribute and sell any products that we develop.

In
a number of countries, including in particular, developing countries, government officials and other groups have suggested that pharmaceutical companies should make drugs available at
a low cost. In some









cases,
governmental authorities have indicated that where pharmaceutical companies do not do so, their patents might not be enforceable to prevent generic competition. Some major pharmaceutical
companies have greatly reduced prices for their drugs in certain developing countries. If certain countries do not permit enforcement of any of our patents, sales of our products in those countries,
and in other countries by importation from low-price countries, could be reduced by generic competition or by parallel importation of our product. Alternatively, governments in those countries could
require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products in those countries, thereby reducing our product sales, or we could respond to
governmental concerns by reducing prices for our products. In all of these situations, our results of operations could be adversely affected.

Government Regulation

Our ongoing research and development activities and any manufacturing and marketing of JAKAFI and our drug candidates are subject to
extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. Before marketing in the United States, any drug developed by us must undergo rigorous preclinical
testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory clearance process implemented by the FDA under the United States Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations. The FDA
regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, record-keeping, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale and distribution and import
and export, of these products.

FDA Review and Approval Process

The regulatory review and approval process is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. The steps generally required before a drug may be
marketed in the United States include:

•preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice
and Good Manufacturing Practice regulations;•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for human clinical testing, which must become
effective before human clinical trials may commence;•performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials in three phases, as described below, to establish the safety
and efficacy of the drug for each indication;•submission of a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA for review;•random inspections of clinical sites to ensure validity of clinical safety and efficacy data;•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to
assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices;•FDA approval of the NDA; and•payment of user and establishment fees, if applicable.

Similar
requirements exist within foreign agencies as well. The time required to satisfy FDA requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies may vary substantially
based on the type, complexity and novelty of the product or the targeted disease.

Preclinical
testing includes laboratory evaluation of product pharmacology, drug metabolism, and toxicity which includes animal studies, to assess potential safety and efficacy as well
as product chemistry, stability, formulation, development, and testing. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as
part of an IND. An IND will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time, the FDA raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the
clinical trial(s) included in the IND. In the latter









case,
the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing
clinical trials to commence.

Clinical
trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators and in accordance with good clinical practices
regulations covering the protection of human subjects. These regulations require all research subjects to provide informed consent. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing the
objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND and each trial
must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB) before it can begin.

Clinical
trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. Phase I usually involves the initial introduction of the
investigational drug into healthy volunteers to evaluate its safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.

Phase II
usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to evaluate dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and
evaluate and gain preliminary evidence of the efficacy of the drug for specific indications.

Phase III
clinical trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and safety by testing the drug in its final form in an expanded patient population, providing statistical
evidence of efficacy and safety, and providing an adequate basis for labeling.

We
cannot guarantee that Phase I, Phase II or Phase III testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we, the
IRB, or the FDA may suspend clinical trials at
any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

As
a separate amendment to an IND, a clinical trial sponsor may submit to the FDA a request for a special protocol assessment (SPA). Under the SPA procedure, a sponsor may seek the FDA's
agreement on the design and size of a clinical trial intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim. If the FDA agrees in writing, its agreement may not be changed after the trial
begins, except when agreed by FDA and sponsor or in limited circumstances, such as when a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety and effectiveness of a drug candidate is
identified after a Phase III clinical trial is commenced and agreement is obtained with the FDA. If the outcome of the trial is successful, the sponsor will ordinarily be able to rely on it as
the primary basis for approval with respect to effectiveness. However, additional trials could also be requested by the FDA to support approval, and the FDA may make an approval decision based on a
number of factors, including the degree of clinical benefit as well as safety. The FDA is not obligated to approve an NDA as a result of an SPA agreement, even if the clinical outcome is positive.

Even
after initial FDA approval has been obtained, post-approval trials, or Phase IV studies, may be required to provide additional data, and will be required to obtain approval
for the sale of a product as a treatment for a clinical indication other than that for which the product was initially tested and approved. Also, the FDA will require post-approval safety reporting to
monitor the side effects of the drug. Results of post-approval programs may limit or expand the indication or indications for which the drug product may be marketed. Further, if there are any requests
for modifications to the initial FDA approval for the drug, including changes in indication, manufacturing process, manufacturing facilities, or labeling, a supplemental NDA may be required to be
submitted to the FDA.

The
length of time and related costs necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and may be difficult to predict. Clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying
interpretations that may delay,









limit
or prevent regulatory approvals. Additional factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials, or cause the costs of these clinical trials to increase,
include:

•slow patient enrollment due to the nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility
criteria for the study, competition with clinical trials for other drug candidates or other factors;•inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring clinical trials;•delays in approvals from a study site's IRB;•longer than anticipated treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or determine the appropriate product dose;•lack of sufficient supplies of the drug candidate for use in clinical trials;•adverse medical events or side effects in treated patients; and•lack of effectiveness of the drug candidate being tested.

Any
drug is likely to produce some toxicities or undesirable side effects in animals and in humans when administered at sufficiently high doses and/or for sufficiently long periods of
time. Unacceptable toxicities or side effects may occur at any dose level, and at any time in the course of animal studies designed to identify unacceptable effects of a drug candidate, known as
toxicological studies, or in clinical trials of our drug candidates. The appearance of any unacceptable toxicity or side effect could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, limit, delay or
abort the development of any of our drug candidates, and could ultimately prevent their marketing approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications.

The
FDA's fast track and breakthrough therapy designation programs are intended to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates intended for the treatment of
serious or life-threatening conditions and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for these conditions. Under these programs, FDA can, for example, review portions of an NDA for
a drug candidate before the entire application is complete, thus potentially beginning the review process at an earlier time.

We
cannot guarantee that the FDA will grant any of our requests for fast track or breakthrough therapy designations, that any such designations would affect the time of review or that
the FDA will approve the NDA submitted for any of our drug candidates, whether or not these designations are granted. Additionally, FDA approval of a fast track/breakthrough product can include
restrictions on the product's use or distribution (such as permitting use only for specified medical conditions or limiting distribution to physicians or facilities with special training or
experience). Approval of such designated products can be conditioned on additional clinical trials after approval.

Sponsors
submit the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs must also contain extensive product manufacturing information and proposed
labeling. Upon receipt, the FDA initially reviews the NDA to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to initiate a substantive review. If the FDA identifies deficiencies that would preclude
substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the NDA and will inform the sponsor of the deficiencies that must be corrected prior to resubmission. If the FDA accepts the submission for review
(then deemed a "filing"), the FDA typically completes the NDA review within a pre-determined time frame. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA agrees to review NDAs under either a standard
review or priority review. FDA procedures provide for priority review of NDAs submitted for drugs that, compared to currently marketed products, if any, offer a significant improvement in the
treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease. The FDA seeks to review NDAs that are granted priority status more quickly than NDAs given standard review status. The FDA's stated policy is to act on
90% of priority NDAs within eight months of receipt (or six months after









filing,
which occurs 60 days after NDA submission). Although the FDA historically has not met these goals, the agency has made significant improvements in the timeliness of the review process.
NDA review often extends beyond anticipated completion dates due to FDA requests for additional data or clarification, the FDA's decision to have an advisory committee review, and difficulties in
scheduling an advisory committee meeting. The recommendations of an advisory committee are not binding on the FDA.

To
obtain FDA approval to market a product, we must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective for the patient population that will be treated. If regulatory approval of a
product is granted, the approval will be limited to those disease states and conditions for which the product is safe and effective, as demonstrated through clinical trials. Marketing or promoting a
drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited. Furthermore, approval may entail requirements for post-marketing studies or risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, including the need for patient
and/or physician education, patient registries, medication or similar guides, or other restrictions on the distribution of the product. If an NDA does not satisfy applicable regulatory criteria, the
FDA may deny approval of an NDA or may issue a complete response, and require, among other things, additional clinical data or analyses.

Outside
the United States, our ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing
the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national
level, although within the European Union (EU) registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. If the regulatory authority is satisfied
that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization may be granted. This foreign regulatory approval process involves all of the risks associated with
FDA approval discussed above and may also include additional risks.

The
Orphan Drug Act provides incentives to manufacturers to develop and market drugs for rare diseases and conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 persons in the United States at the
time of application for orphan drug designation. The first developer to receive FDA marketing approval for an orphan drug is entitled to a seven year exclusive marketing period in the United States
for the orphan drug indication. However, a drug that the FDA considers to be clinically superior to, or different from, another approved orphan drug, even though for the same indication, may also
obtain approval in the United States during the seven year exclusive marketing period.

Legislation
similar to the Orphan Drug Act has been enacted in other countries outside of the United States, including the EU. The orphan legislation in the EU is available for therapies
addressing conditions that affect five or fewer out of 10,000 persons, are life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions and for which no satisfactory treatment is authorized. The market
exclusivity period is for ten years, although that period can be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, available evidence establishes that the product does not justify maintenance of
market exclusivity.

Regulation of Manufacturing Process

Even when NDA approval is obtained, a marketed product, such as JAKAFI, its manufacturer and its manufacturing facilities are subject
to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA. The manufacturing process for pharmaceutical products is highly regulated and regulators may shut down manufacturing facilities that they
believe do not comply with regulations. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, including
costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market. Manufacturing facilities are always subject to inspection by the applicable regulatory authorities.









We and our third-party manufacturers are subject to current Good Manufacturing Practices, which are extensive regulations governing manufacturing processes,
including but not limited to stability testing, record keeping and quality standards as defined by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency. Similar regulations are in effect in other countries.
Manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the applicable regulatory authorities. These facilities, whether our own or our contract manufacturers, must be inspected before we can use them
in commercial manufacturing of our related products. We or our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with applicable Good Manufacturing Practices and FDA or other regulatory requirements.
If we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply, we or our contract manufacturers may be subject to legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, or voluntary
recall of product. Furthermore, continued compliance with applicable Good Manufacturing Practices will require continual expenditure of time, money and effort on the part of us or our contract
manufacturers in the areas of production and quality control and record keeping and reporting, in order to ensure full compliance.

Post-Approval Regulation

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA,
including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the drug and other reporting, advertising and promotion restrictions. The FDA's rules for advertising and promotion
require, among other things, that our promotion be fairly balanced and adequately substantiated by clinical studies, and that we not promote our products for unapproved uses. We must also submit
appropriate new and supplemental applications and obtain FDA approval for certain changes to the approved product, product labeling or manufacturing process. On its own initiative, the FDA may require
changes to the labeling of an approved drug if it becomes aware of new safety information that the agency believes should be included in the approved drug's labeling. The FDA also enforces the
requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which, among other things, imposes various requirements in connection with the distribution of product samples to physicians.

In
addition to inspections related to manufacturing, we are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies related to the other regulatory
requirements that apply to marketed drugs manufactured or distributed by us. The FDA also may conduct periodic inspections regarding our review and reporting of adverse events, or related to
compliance with the requirements of the PDMA concerning the handling of drug samples. When the FDA conducts an inspection, the inspectors will identify any deficiencies they believe exist in the form
of a notice of inspectional observations. The observations may be more or less significant. If we receive a notice of inspectional observations, we likely will be required to respond in writing, and
may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the FDA's concerns.

There
are a variety of state laws and regulations that apply in the states or localities where JAKAFI and our drug candidates are or may be marketed. For example, we must comply with
state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in that state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship
products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the
pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the
distribution chain. Any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market, or increase the cost of marketing, our products in those states or localities.

The
FDA's policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted which could impose additional burdens or limitations on our ability to market products after approval.
Moreover, increased attention to the containment of health care costs in the United States and in foreign markets could result in new government regulations which could have a material adverse effect
on our business. We









cannot
predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation which might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.

Marketing Exclusivity

The FDA may grant five years of exclusivity in the United States for the approval of NDAs for new chemical entities, and three years of
exclusivity for supplemental NDAs, for among other things, new indications, dosages or dosage forms of an existing drug if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant
are essential to the approval of the supplemental application. Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a
sponsor submits and the agency accepts requested information relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. The six month pediatric exclusivity is added to any existing patent
or non-patent exclusivity period for which the drug is eligible. Orphan drug products are also eligible for pediatric exclusivity if the FDA requests and the company completes pediatric clinical
trials.

Health Law Compliance

There
are also an increasing number of state laws that require manufacturers to make reports to those states on certain pricing and marketing information. Many of these laws contain
ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the state
authorities.

Healthcare Reform and Reimbursement and Pricing Controls

There has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years in the United States. Although there are no direct government price
controls over private sector purchases in the United States, there are rebates and other financial requirements for federal and state health care programs.









The
Medicare Modernization Act, enacted in December 2003, established the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, which is provided primarily through private
entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. The health care reform legislation enacted in 2010, known as the Affordable Care Act, requires drug
manufacturers to pay 50% of the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the "donut hole," on prescriptions for branded products filled when the beneficiary reaches this coverage.

The
Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 resulted in changes to the way drug prices are reported to the government and the formula using such information to calculate the required Medicaid
rebates. The Affordable Care Act increased the minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% and requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay states rebates on
prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, the Affordable Care Act increased the additional Medicaid rebate on "line extensions" (such as extended release
formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, revised the definition of average manufacturer price by changing the classes of purchasers included in the calculation, and expanded the
entities eligible for discounted pricing under the federal 340B drug pricing program. Current orphan drugs are excluded from the
expanded 340B hospitals eligible for discounts and the increased rebates to Medicaid on line extension and sustained release formulations.

The
Affordable Care Act imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income
tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer's market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs. The
Affordable Care Act also contains a number of provisions, including provisions governing the way that health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, enrollment in federal health
care programs, reimbursement changes, the increased use of comparative effectiveness research in health care decision-making, and enhancements to fraud and abuse requirements and enforcement, that
will affect existing government health care programs and will result in the development of new programs.

The
Affordable Care Act also contains new requirements to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, including reporting certain payments or other
"transfers of value" made and reporting any investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during each calendar year beginning in 2013, with reporting starting in 2014. We
are preparing to submit our first report, which is due March 31, 2014.

We
are unable to predict the future course of federal or state health care legislation and regulations, including regulations that will be issued to implement provisions of the
Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act and further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.

Public
and private health care payers control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms, including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through
the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class. Payers also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug
that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered. Payers may require physicians to seek approval from them before a product will be reimbursed or covered,
commonly referred to as prior authorization. In particular, many public and private health care payers limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the FDA or
appear in a recognized drug compendium. Drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or
not supported by the available evidence, whether or not such uses have been approved by the FDA. For example, in the case of Medicare Part D coverage for oncology drugs, the Medicare
Modernization Act, with certain exceptions, provides for









Medicare
coverage of unapproved uses of an FDA-approved drug if the unapproved use is reasonable and necessary and is supported by one or more citations in CMS-approved compendia, such as the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network Drugs and Biologics Compendium.

Different
pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. For example, in the European Union, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing
and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers. The approach taken varies from member state to member state. Some
jurisdictions operate positive or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. Other member states allow companies to fix their own
prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits and may limit or restrict reimbursement. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, and prescription drugs in particular, has
become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products, as exemplified by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the United Kingdom
which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government. In addition, in some countries cross-border imports from low-priced markets (parallel
imports) exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.

Manufacturing

Our manufacturing strategy is to contract with third parties to manufacture the raw materials, our active pharmaceutical ingredients,
or API, and finished solid dose products for clinical and commercial uses. We currently do not operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of JAKAFI or our drug candidates.
In addition, we expect for the foreseeable future to continue to rely on third parties for the manufacture of commercial supplies of the raw materials, API and finished drug product for any drugs that
we successfully develop and are approved for commercial sale. In this manner, we continue to build and maintain our supply chain and quality assurance resources.

Manufacturing of our Products

Our supply chain for manufacturing raw materials, API and drug product ready for distribution and commercialization is a multi-step
international process. Establishing and
managing the supply chain requires a significant financial commitment and the creation and maintenance of numerous third-party contractual relationships.

We
contract with third parties to manufacture our drug candidates and JAKAFI for clinical and commercial purposes. Third-party manufacturers supply us with raw materials, and other
third-party manufacturers convert these raw materials into API or convert the API into final dosage form. For most of our drug candidates, once our raw materials are produced, we rely on one third
party to manufacture the API, another to make finished drug product and a third to package and label the finished product. For ruxolitinib phosphate, the API for JAKAFI, we use and rely on a single
third-party contract manufacturer in the United States. We are in the process of qualifying a second manufacturer for the supply of ruxolitinib phosphate, however, there is no assurance that we will
be able to identify and qualify a second source of supply for ruxolitinib phosphate (or any of our other drug candidates) on a timely basis.

We
also rely on third-party contract manufacturers to tablet or capsulate all of our active pharmaceutical ingredients for clinical and commercial uses. For example, we use and rely on a
single third-party manufacturer to tablet and manufacture the finished product of JAKAFI. We are in the process of qualifying a second manufacturer for the commercial supply of JAKAFI, however, there
is no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify a second source of supply for JAKAFI tablets on a timely basis.

We
may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of any of our raw materials, drug candidates, ruxolitinib phosphate, or JAKAFI if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity
or capability to manufacture our products according to our schedule and specifications. If any of these single source









suppliers
were to become unable or unwilling to supply us with API or finished product that complies with applicable regulatory requirements, we could incur significant delays in our clinical trials
or interruption of commercial supply which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

We
have established a quality assurance program intended to ensure that our third-party manufacturers and service providers produce materials and provide services, when applicable, in
accordance with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practices and other applicable regulations.

For
our future products, we intend to continue to establish third-party suppliers to manufacture sufficient quantities of our drug candidates to undertake clinical trials and to
manufacture sufficient
quantities of any product that is approved for commercial sale. If we are unable to contract for large scale manufacturing with third parties on acceptable terms for our future products or develop
manufacturing capabilities internally, our ability to conduct large scale clinical trials and meet customer demand for commercial products will be adversely affected.

Third-party Manufacturers

Our third-party manufacturers are independent entities, under contract with us, who are subject to their own unique operational and
financial risks which are out of our control. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to perform as required, this could impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis or
cause delays in our clinical trials and applications for regulatory approval. To the extent these risks materialize and affect their performance obligations to us, our financial results may be
adversely affected.

We
believe the technology used to manufacture our products is proprietary. For products manufactured by our third-party manufacturers, we have licensed the necessary aspects of this
manufacturing technology that we believe is proprietary to us to enable them to manufacture the products for us. We have agreements with these third-party manufacturers that are intended to restrict
these manufacturers from using or revealing our technology, but we cannot be certain that these third-party manufacturers will comply with these restrictions.

While
we believe there are multiple third parties capable of providing most of the materials and services we need in order to manufacture ruxolitinib phosphate and distribute JAKAFI, and
that supply of materials that cannot be second-sourced can be managed with inventory planning, there is always a risk that we may underestimate demand, and that our manufacturing capacity through
third-party manufacturers may not be sufficient. In addition, because of the significant lead times involved in our supply chain for ruxolitinib phosphate, we may have less flexibility to adjust our
supply in response to changes in demand than if we had shorter lead times.

Access to Supplies and Materials

Our third-party manufacturers need access to certain supplies and products to manufacture JAKAFI and our drug candidates. If delivery
of material from their suppliers were interrupted for any reason or if they are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of raw materials used to manufacture JAKAFI and our drug candidates, they may
be unable to ship JAKAFI for commercial supply or to supply our drug candidates in development for clinical trials. For example, currently raw materials used to manufacture ruxolitinib phosphate, the
API in JAKAFI, are supplied by Chinese-based companies. As a result, an international trade dispute between China and the United
States or any other actions by the Chinese government that would limit or prevent Chinese companies from supplying these materials would adversely affect our ability to manufacture and supply our
products to meet market needs and have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.









Research and Development

Since our inception, we have made substantial investments in research and technology development. During the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we incurred research and development expenses of $260.4 million, $210.4 million and $178.7 million, respectively.

Human Resources

As of December 31, 2013, we had 481 employees, including 287 in research and development, 24 in medical affairs, 115 in sales
and marketing and 55 in operations support, finance and administrative positions. Of these employees, 138 employees have advanced technical degrees, including 13 MDs and
125 doctorate degrees. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and management considers relations with our employees to be good.
