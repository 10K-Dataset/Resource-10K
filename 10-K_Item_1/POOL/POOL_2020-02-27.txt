Item 1.  Business



General



Pool Corporation (theCompany, which may be referred to aswe, usorour) is the world’s largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products and is one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States.  Our vision is to become the best worldwide distributor of outdoor living products that enhance the quality of outdoor home life.  The Company was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1993 and has grown from a regional distributor to a multi-national, multi-network distribution company.



Our industry is highly fragmented, and as such, we add considerable value to the industry by purchasing products from a large number of manufacturers and then distributing the products to our customer base on conditions that are more favorable than our customers could obtain on their own.



As of December 31, 2019, we operated373sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia through our four distribution networks:



•SCP Distributors (SCP);

•Superior Pool Products (Superior);

•Horizon Distributors (Horizon); and

•National Pool Tile (NPT).



Our Industry



We believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young, with room for continued growth from the increased penetration of new pools.  Significant growth opportunities also reside with pool remodel and pool equipment replacement activities due to the aging of the installed base of swimming pools, technological advancements and the development of energy-efficient and more aesthetically attractive products.  Additionally, the desire for consumers to enhance their outdoor living spaces with hardscapes, lighting and outdoor kitchens also promotes growth in this area.



Favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends have positively impacted our industry and we believe these trends will continue to do so in the long term.  These favorable trends include the following:



•long-term growth in housing units in warmer markets due to the population migration toward the southern United States, where use of the outdoor home environment is more prevalent and extends longer throughout the year;

•increased homeowner spending on outdoor living spaces for relaxation and entertainment;

•consumers bundling the purchase of a swimming pool and other products, with new irrigation systems, landscaping and improvements to outdoor living spaces often being key components to both pool installations and remodels; and

•consumers using more automation and control products, higher quality materials and other pool features that add to our sales opportunities over time.



Almost 60% of consumer spending in the pool industry is for maintenance and minor repair of existing swimming pools.  Maintaining proper chemical balance and the related upkeep and repair of swimming pool equipment, such as pumps, heaters, filters and safety equipment, creates a non-discretionary demand for pool chemicals, equipment and other related parts and supplies.  We also believe cosmetic considerations such as a pool’s appearance and the overall look of backyard environments create an ongoing demand for other maintenance-related goods and certain discretionary products.



We believe that the recurring nature of the maintenance and repair market has historically helped maintain a relatively consistent rate of industry growth.  This characteristic has helped cushion the negative impact on revenues in periods when unfavorable economic conditions and softness in the housing market adversely impacted consumer discretionary spending including pool construction and major replacement and refurbishment activities.








The following table reflects growth in the domestic installed base of in-ground swimming pools over the past 11 years (based on Company estimates and information from 2018 P.K. Data, Inc. reports):







The replacement and refurbishment market currently accounts for close to 25% of consumer spending in the pool industry.  The activity in this market, which includes major swimming pool remodeling, is driven by the aging of the installed base of pools.  The timing of these types of expenditures is more sensitive to economic factors including home values, single-family home sales and consumer confidence that impact consumer spending compared to the maintenance and minor repair market.



New swimming pool construction comprises just over 15% of consumer spending in the pool industry.  The demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation, entertainment, family activity, exercise and convenience.  The industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling, boats, motorcycles, recreational vehicles and vacations.  The industry is also affected by other factors including, but not limited to, consumer preferences or attitudes toward pool and related outdoor living products for aesthetic, environmental, safety or other reasons.



The irrigation and landscape industry shares many characteristics with the pool industry, and we believe that it will realize similar long-term growth rates.  Irrigation system installations often occur in tandem with new single-family home construction making it more susceptible to economic variables that drive new home sales.  However, the landscape industry offers similar maintenance-related growth opportunities as the swimming pool industry.  Product offerings such as chemicals and fertilizers, power equipment and related repair and maintenance services offer recurring revenue streams in an industry otherwise closely tied to the housing market.  The irrigation and landscape distribution business serves both residential and commercial markets, with the majority of sales related to the residential market.  Irrigation accounts for approximately 35% - 40% of total spending in the industry, with the remaining 60% - 65% of spending related to landscape maintenance products, power equipment, hardscapes and specialty outdoor products and accessories.








Our NPT network primarily serves the swimming pool market but does provide some overlap with the irrigation and landscape industries as we offer our market-leading brand of pool tile, composite pool finish products and hardscapes.  As more consumers create and enhance outdoor living areas and continue to invest in their outdoor environment, we believe we can focus our resources to address such demand, while leveraging our existing pool and irrigation and landscape customer base.  We feel the development of our NPT network is a natural extension of our distribution model.  In addition to our 17 standalone NPT sales centers, we currently have over 100 SCP and Superior sales centers that feature consumer showrooms where landscape and swimming pool contractors, as well as homeowners, can view and select pool components including pool tile, decking materials and interior pool finishes in various styles and grades, and serve as stocking locations for our NPT branded products.  We also offer virtual tools for homeowners to shop, select and design their pool and outdoor environments, working with their chosen contractors to install these products.  We believe our showrooms, local stocking of products and virtual support provide us with a competitive advantage in these categories.  Given the more discretionary nature of these products, this business is more sensitive to external market factors compared to our business overall.



Economic Environment



Certain trends in the housing market, the availability of consumer credit and general economic conditions (as commonly measured by Gross Domestic Product or GDP) affect our industry, particularly new pool and irrigation system starts as well as the timing and extent of pool refurbishments, equipment replacement, landscaping projects and outdoor living space renovations.



We believe that over the long term, single-family housing turnover and home value appreciation may correlate with demand for new pool construction, with higher rates of home turnover and appreciation having a positive impact on new pool starts over time.  We also believe that homeowners’ access to consumer credit is a critical factor enabling the purchase of new swimming pools and irrigation systems.  Similar to other discretionary purchases, replacement and refurbishment activities are more heavily impacted by economic factors such as consumer confidence, GDP and employment levels.  Contractor labor availability has also become an issue in recent years, limiting our customers’ ability to fully meet consumer construction and renovation demand.



The post-recession market environment from 2010 to 2019 has been characterized by steady economic expansion, the cautious recovery of consumer spending, modest housing recovery and low inflation.  However, in terms of homeowners investing in their existing homes, discretionary expenditures, including backyard renovations, have flourished over this time period with steady increases in home values and lack of affordable new homes prompting homeowners to stay in their homes longer and upgrade their home environments, including their backyard.  While we estimate that new pool construction increased to approximately 80,000 new units in 2019, construction levels are still down approximately 65% compared to peak historical levels and down approximately 50% from what we consider normal levels.  An average of approximately 170,000 new units per year were built in the years leading up to the recession.  We expect that new pool and irrigation construction levels will continue to grow incrementally, but we believe that consumer investments in outdoor living spaces beyond the swimming pool will generate greater growth over the next several years.



Times of strong economic conditions in the United States enable further replacement, remodeling and new construction activity.  Although some constraints exist around residential construction activities, economic trends indicate that consumer spending has largely recovered, and we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of both the market expansion and the inherent long-term growth opportunities in our industry.  Additionally, recent regulation passed by the U.S. Department of Energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps for swimming pools must be variable speed by July 2021.  This mandate, coupled with additional product developments and technological advancements, offers further growth opportunities over the next few years.



Considering the factors discussed above, we believe we will realize annual sales growth rates of approximately 6% to 8% over the next five years.








Business Strategy and Growth



Our mission is to provide exceptional value to our customers and suppliers, creating exceptional return to our shareholders, while providing exceptional opportunities to our employees.  Our core strategies are as follows:



•to promote the growth of our industry;

•to promote the growth of our customers’ businesses; and

•to continuously strive to operate more effectively.



We promote the growth of our industry through various advertising and promotional programs intended to raise consumer awareness of the benefits and affordability of pool ownership, the ease of pool maintenance and the many ways in which a pool and the surrounding spaces may be enjoyed beyond swimming.  These programs include digital and media advertising, industry-oriented website development such aswww.swimmingpool.com® andwww.hottubs.com® and other digital marketing initiatives.  We use these programs as tools to educate consumers and lead prospective pool owners to our customers.



We promote the growth of our customers’ businesses by offering comprehensive support programs that include promotional tools and marketing support to help our customers generate increased sales.  Our uniquely tailored programs include such features as customer lead generation, personalized websites, brochures, direct mail, marketing campaigns and business development training.  As a customer service, we also provide certain retail store customers assistance with all aspects of their business, including site selection, store layout and design, product merchandising, business management system implementation, comprehensive product offering selections and efficient ordering and inventory management processes.  In addition to these programs, we feature consumer showrooms in over 100 of our sales centers and host our annual Retail Summit to educate our customers about product offerings and the overall industry.  We also act as a day-to-day resource by offering product and market expertise to serve our customers’ unique needs.



In addition to our efforts aimed at industry and customer growth, we strive to operate more effectively by continuously focusing on improvements in our operations.  We strive to create capacity with business to business development tools and execution to ensure best-in-class service and value creation for our customers and suppliers.  In particular, we have developed the Pool360 and Horizon 24/7 platforms that help our customers be more productive by allowing them to get pricing, check availability, enter orders and make payments online while leveraging our customer service staff resources, particularly during peak business periods.  These tools not only offer real-time integration into our enterprise resource planning system, creating efficiencies in our business processes as well, but they also provide our customers graphical catalog presentation in the same platform.  We are also actively making improvements to our sales centers and warehouses, including improved showroom layouts, sales center merchandising and velocity slotting.  Velocity slotting uses technology to identify fast moving, high velocity items, which are then color-coded and placed in an easily accessible location to create efficiencies for both our employees and customers.  In addition to these initiatives, we strive to expand our Pool Corporation-branded products and exclusive brand offerings and to continue to emphasize an Employer of Choice culture.



We have grown our distribution networks through new sales center openings, acquisitions and the expansion of existing sales centers depending on our market presence and capacity.  For additional information regarding our new sales center openings, acquisitions and closures/consolidations, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and Item 8, Note 2 of “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,” included in this Form 10-K.



We plan to continue to make strategic acquisitions and open new sales centers to further penetrate existing markets and expand into both new geographic markets and new product categories.  We believe that our high customer service levels and expanded product offerings have enabled us to gain market share historically. Going forward, we expect to realize sales growth higher than the industry average due to further increases in market share and continued expansion of our product offerings.



We estimate that price inflation has averaged 1% to 2% annually in our industry over the past 10 years, although we experienced inflation above our historical average in 2019.  We generally pass industry price increases through our supply chain and may make strategic volume inventory purchases ahead of vendor price increases in order to obtain favorable pricing.  We estimate that annual price inflation between 2017 and 2018 was consistent with the ten-year average.  In 2018, several manufacturers announced and implemented a mid-season price increase to offset raw material, transportation and labor inflation, which resulted in price inflation that was approximately 2% above the historical range as we sold through the products in 2019.  We anticipate a return to the historical average in 2020.








Customers and Products



We serve roughly 120,000 customers.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our sales in 2019.  Most of our customers are small, family-owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources.  Most of these businesses provide labor and technical services to the end consumer and operate as independent contractors and specialty retailers employing no more than ten employees (in many cases, working alone or with a limited crew).  These customers also buy from other distributors, mass merchants, home stores, and certain specialty and internet retailers.



We provide extended payment terms to qualified customers for sales under early buy programs.  The extended terms usually require payments in equal installments in April, May and June or May and June depending on geographic location.  See Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Allowance for Doubtful Accounts” for additional information.



We sell our products primarily to the following types of customers:



•swimming pool remodelers and builders;

•specialty retailers that sell swimming pool supplies;

•swimming pool repair and service businesses;

•irrigation construction and landscape maintenance contractors; and

•commercial customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels, universities and community recreational facilities.



We conduct our operations through373sales centers in North America, Europe and Australia.  Our primary markets, with the highest concentration of swimming pools, are California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, collectively representing approximately 52% of our 2019 net sales.  In 2019, we generated approximately 94% of our sales in North America (including Canada and Mexico), 5% in Europe and 1% in Australia.  While we continue to expand both domestically and internationally, we expect this geographic mix to be similar over the next few years.  References to product line and product category data throughout this Form 10-K generally reflect data related to the North American swimming pool market, as it is more readily available for analysis and represents the largest component of our operations.



We use a combination of local and international sales and marketing personnel to promote the growth of our business and develop and strengthen our customers’ businesses.  Our sales and marketing personnel focus on developing customer programs and promotional activities, creating and enhancing sales management tools and providing product and market expertise.  Our local sales personnel work from our sales centers and are charged with understanding and meeting our customers’ specific needs.



We offer our customers more than 200,000 manufacturer and Pool Corporation-branded products.  We believe that our selection of pool equipment, supplies, chemicals, replacement parts, irrigation and related products and other pool construction and recreational products is the most comprehensive in the industry.  We sell the following types of products:



•maintenance products, such as chemicals, supplies and pool accessories;

•repair and replacement parts for pool equipment, such as cleaners, filters, heaters, pumps and lights;

•fiberglass pools and spas and packaged pool kits including walls, liners, braces and coping for in-ground and above-ground pools;

•pool equipment and components for new pool construction and the remodeling of existing pools;

•irrigation and related products, including irrigation system components and professional lawn care equipment and supplies;

•building materials, such as concrete, plumbing and electrical components, both functional and decorative pool surfaces, decking materials, tile, hardscapes and natural stone, used for pool installations and remodeling;

•commercial products, including American Society of Material Engineers (ASME) heaters, safety equipment, and commercial pumps and filters; and

•other pool construction and recreational products, which consist of a number of product categories and include discretionary recreational and related outdoor living products, such as spas, grills and components for outdoor kitchens, that enhance consumers’ use and enjoyment of outdoor living spaces.



We currently have over 600 product lines and approximately 50 product categories.  Based on our 2019 product classifications, sales for our pool and spa chemicals product category represented approximately 12% of total net sales for 2019, 2018 and 2017.  No other product categories accounted for 10% or more of total net sales in any of the last three fiscal years.








We continue to identify new related product categories, and we typically introduce new categories each year in select markets.  We then evaluate the performance in these markets and focus on those product categories that we believe exhibit the best long-term growth potential.  We expect to realize continued sales growth for these types of product offerings by expanding the number of locations that offer these products, increasing the number of products offered at certain locations and continuing a modest broadening of these product offerings on a company-wide basis.



Recent regulation passed by the U.S. Department of Energy mandates all new and replacement motors and pumps sold for swimming pools must be variable speed by July 2021.  We expect to see minimal impact from this change until mid-way through the 2021 season.New product technology provides opportunities not only for improved energy efficiency but also new enticements for leisure activities.  Smart controls provide growth opportunities as most existing swimming pools run on mechanical time clocks.  Major equipment manufacturers have developed and will continue to develop more retrofit kits that allow homeowners to interact with their pools or hot tubs through their smartphones.  Robotic cleaners offer consumers a more efficient option for maintaining their swimming pools.  We see each of these developments as significant growth opportunities.



We offer a growing selection of energy efficient and environmentally preferred products, which supports sustainability and helps our customers save energy, water and money.  Our green technology products include variable speed pumps, LED pool and spa lights and high-efficiency heat pumps.  We are committed to sustainable business practices, which includes products that we offer to our customers, our sourcing activities, our employment practices and our involvement within the communities in which we do business. We believe these efforts continue to be successful in creating value for our customers, shareholders, employees, suppliers and communities.



Over the last several years, we have increased our product offerings and service abilities related to commercial swimming pools.  We consider the commercial market to be a key growth opportunity as we focus more attention on providing products to customers who service large commercial installations such as hotels, universities and community recreational facilities.  While we are leveraging our existing networks and relationships to grow this market, in 2017, we also acquired Lincoln Equipment, Inc., a national distributor of equipment and supplies to commercial and institutional swimming pool customers.



In 2019, the sale of maintenance and minor repair products (non-discretionary) accounted for almost 60% of our sales and gross profits while just over 40% of our sales and gross profits were derived from the refurbishment, replacement, construction and installation (equipment, materials, plumbing, electrical, etc.) of swimming pools (partially discretionary).  During the economic downturn, which spanned from late 2006 to early 2010 and reached its low point in 2009, sales of maintenance and minor repair products had increased to approximately 70% of our sales and gross profits due to the significant declines in new pool construction and deferred remodeling and replacement activity.  The current trend reflects a partial shift back toward a greater percentage of our sales coming from major refurbishment and replacement products due to the recovery of these activities since levels reached their historic low point in 2009.



Post-2009, we experienced product and customer mix changes, including a shift in consumer spending to some higher value, lower margin products such as variable speed pumps and high efficiency heaters.  These products positively contribute to our sales and gross profit growth but negatively impact our gross margin.  We expect continued demand for these products, but believe our efforts in various pricing and sourcing initiatives, including growth in our higher margin private label and exclusive products (PLEX) and our expansion of building materials product offerings, have helped offset these gross margin declines and will lead to somewhat flat gross margin trends over the next few years.



Operating Strategy



We distribute swimming pool supplies, equipment and related leisure products domestically through our SCP and Superior networks and internationally through our SCP network.  We adopted the strategy of operating two distinct distribution networks within the U.S. swimming pool market primarily to offer our customers a choice of distinctive product selections, locations and service personnel.



We distribute irrigation and related products through our Horizon network and tile, decking materials and interior pool finish products through our NPT network, as well as through SCP and Superior networks.  We evaluate our sales centers based on their performance relative to predetermined standards that include both financial and operational measures.  Our corporate support groups provide our field operations with various services, such as developing and coordinating customer and vendor related programs, human resources support, information systems support and expert resources to help them achieve their goals.  We believe our incentive programs and feedback tools, along with the competitive nature of our internal networks, stimulate and enhance employee performance.








Distribution



Our sales centers are located within population centers near customer concentrations, typically in industrial, commercial or mixed-use zones.  Customers may pick up products at any sales center location, or we may deliver products to their premises or job sites via our trucks or third-party carriers.



Our sales centers maintain well-stocked inventories to meet our customers’ immediate needs.  We utilize warehouse management technology to optimize receiving, inventory control, picking, packing and shipping functions.  For additional information regarding our inventory management, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Inventory Obsolescence,” of this Form 10-K.



We also operate four centralized shipping locations (CSLs) in the United States that redistribute products we purchase in bulk quantities to our sales centers or, in some cases, directly to customers.  Our CSLs are regional locations that carry a wide range of traditional swimming pool, irrigation and landscape products and related construction products.



Purchasing and Suppliers



We enjoy good relationships with our suppliers, who generally offer competitive pricing, return policies and promotional allowances.  It is customary in our industry for certain manufacturers to manage their shipments by offering seasonal terms to qualifying purchasers such as Pool Corporation, which are referred to as early buy purchases.  These early buy purchases typically allow us to place orders in the fall at a modest discount, take delivery of product during the off-season months and pay for these purchases in the spring or early summer.



Our preferred vendor program encourages our distribution networks to stock and sell products from a smaller number of vendors offering the best overall terms and service to optimize profitability and shareholder return.  We also work closely with our vendors to develop programs and services to better meet the needs of our customers and to concentrate our inventory investments.  These practices, together with a more comprehensive service offering, have positively impacted our selling margins and our returns on inventory investments.  See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Vendor Programs,” for additional information.



We regularly evaluate supplier relationships and consider alternate sourcing to assure competitive cost, service and quality standards.  Our largest suppliers include Pentair plc, Hayward Pool Products, Inc. and Zodiac Pool Systems, Inc., which accounted for approximately 20%, 9% and 8%, respectively, of the cost of products we sold in 2019.



Competition



We are the largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool and related backyard products (based on industry knowledge and available data) and the only truly national wholesale distributor focused on the swimming pool industry in the United States.  We are also one of the leading distributors of irrigation and landscape products in the United States.  We face intense competition from many regional and local distributors in our markets and from one national wholesale distributor of landscape supplies.  We also face competition, both directly and indirectly, from mass market retailers (both store-based and internet) and large pool supply retailers who primarily buy directly from manufacturers.



Some geographic markets we serve, particularly the four largest and higher pool density markets of California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, have a greater concentration of competition than others.  Barriers to entry in our industry are relatively low.  We believe that the principal competitive factors in swimming pool and irrigation and landscape supply distribution are:



•the breadth and availability of products offered;

•the quality and level of customer service, including ease of ordering and product delivery;

•the breadth and depth of sales and marketing programs;

•consistency and stability of business relationships with customers and suppliers;

•competitive product pricing; and

•geographic proximity to the customer.



We believe that we generally compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.








Seasonality and Weather



Our business is highly seasonal.  In general, sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters, which represent the peak months of swimming pool use, pool and irrigation installation and remodeling and repair activities.  Sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters.  In 2019, we generated approximately 63% of our net sales and 81% of our operating income in the second and third quarters of the year.



We typically experience a build-up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the peak selling season.  Excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases, our peak borrowing usually occurs during the late spring and summer, primarily because extended terms offered by our suppliers are typically payable in April, May and June, while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in June, July and August.



We expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired sales centers.  Based on our peak summer selling season, we generally open new sales centers and close or consolidate sales centers, when warranted, either in the first quarter before the peak selling season begins or in the fourth quarter after the peak selling season ends.



Weather is one of the principal external factors affecting our business.  The table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions.



WeatherPossible EffectsHot and dry•Increased purchases of chemicals and suppliesfor existing swimming pools•Increased purchases of above-ground pools andirrigation and lawn care products•Fewer pool and irrigation and landscapinginstallationsUnseasonably cool weather or extraordinary amounts•Decreased purchases of chemicals and suppliesof rain•Decreased purchases of impulse items such asabove-ground pools and accessoriesUnseasonably early warming trends in spring/late cooling•A longer pool and landscape season, thus positivelytrends in fallimpacting our sales(primarily in the northern half of the U.S. and Canada)Unseasonably late warming trends in spring/early cooling•A shorter pool and landscape season, thus negativelytrends in fallimpacting our sales(primarily in the northern half of the U.S. and Canada)



For discussion regarding the effects seasonality and weather had on our results of operations in 2019 and 2018, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations,” of this Form 10-K.



Environmental, Health and Safety Regulations



Our business is subject to regulation under local fire codes and international, federal, state and local environmental and health and safety requirements, including regulation by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Department of Transportation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the National Fire Protection Agency and the International Maritime Organization.  Most of these requirements govern the packaging, labeling, handling, transportation, storage and sale of chemicals and fertilizers.  We store certain types of chemicals and/or fertilizers at each of our sales centers and the storage of these items is strictly regulated by local fire codes.  In addition, we sell algaecides and pest control products that are regulated as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act and various state pesticide laws.  These laws primarily relate to labeling, annual registration and licensing.








Employees



We employed approximately 4,500 people at December 31, 2019.  Given the seasonal nature of our business, our peak employment period is the summer and, depending on expected sales levels, we add 200 to 500 employees to our work force to meet seasonal demand.



Intellectual Property



We maintain both domestic and foreign registered trademarks and patents, primarily for our Pool Corporation and Pool Systems Pty. Ltd. (PSL) branded products that are important to our current and future business operations.  We also own rights to numerous internet domain names.
