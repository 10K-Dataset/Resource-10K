ITEM 1.BUSINESS

Our
Company

Align Technology, Inc (“We”, “Our”, “Align”) designs, manufactures and markets a
system of clear aligner therapy, intra-oral scanners and CAD/CAM (computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing) digital services used in dentistry, orthodontics, and dental records storage.  Align Technology was founded in March
1997 and incorporated in Delaware in April 1997.  Our headquarters are located at 2560 Orchard Parkway, San Jose, California 95131, and our telephone number is 408-470-1000.  Our international headquarters are located in
Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

We have two operating segments: (1) Clear Aligner, known as the Invisalign system; and
(2) Scanners and CAD/CAM Services, known as iTero and iOC intra-oral scanners and OrthoCAD services.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, Clear Aligner revenues represent approximately 94 percent of worldwide revenue, while
Scanners and CAD/CAM Services represent the remaining 6 percent of worldwide revenues.  We distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers: orthodontists and general practitioner dentists, or GPs, as well as to
restorative dentists, including prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons.

We received the United States Food and
Drug Administration (“FDA”) clearance to market the Invisalign system in 1998.  The Invisalign system is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device.  In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their
patients, orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course.  The Invisalign system is sold in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America and Japan.  We use a distributor model for the sale
of our products in non-core country markets in the Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Latin America regions.

On April 29, 2011, we acquired Cadent Holdings, Inc.  (“Cadent”), a leading provider of 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry.   Since this
acquisition, we now manufacture the iTero and iOC digital intra-oral scanners and provide CAD/CAM restorative models for use by dental professionals and/or labs and services for orthodontic digital procedures.  In North America, Scanners
and CAD/CAM Services are sold through our direct sales force and distribution partners.  In Europe, and other regions outside of North America, we use a distributor model for the sale of our Scanners and CAD/CAM Services.







Clear Aligner Segment

Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment

Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting nearly a billion people, or approximately 50 to 75% of the population of major developed
countries.   Approximately 6.8 million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide, of which approximately 2.6 million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to Invisalign treatment—our served
market.

In the United States (“U.S.”), orthodontists and GPs treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and
brackets, referred to as braces, and augment braces with elastics, metal bands, headgear and other ancillary devices as needed.  Options available to attempt to improve treatment aesthetics include using ceramic, tooth-colored brackets or
bonding brackets on the inside, or lingual surface, of the patient’s teeth.  The average treatment takes approximately 12 to 24 months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement, known in the
industry as “chair time,” including the initial diagnosis, creation of an appropriate treatment plan and bonding of the brackets to the patient’s teeth and attachment of arch wires to the brackets.  Subsequent visits involve
tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks until the final visit when the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient’s teeth.  Upon completion of the treatment,
the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use a retainer.

The Invisalign System

The Invisalign system is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctor-prescribed, custom
manufactured, clear plastic removable orthodontic aligners.  The Invisalign system offers a range of treatment options, specialized services, and proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases:

Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us.    The dental professional
prepares and sends us a patient’s treatment data package which consists of a prescription form, a polyvinyl-siloxane, or PVS impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional’s election,
x-rays of the patient’s dentition.  The dental professional can also submit an intra-oral scan or “digital impression” through an iTero or iOC intra-oral scanner instead of a physical PVS impression.

Preparation of 3D computer models of the patient’s initial malocclusion.    Upon receipt, we use the
treatment data to construct digital models of the patient’s dentition.  Using computed tomography, known as CT scanning, we scan the PVS impression to develop a digital, three-dimensional computer model of the patient’s current
dentition.  In cases where the dental professional submits a digital impression, this step in the process is eliminated.

Preparation of computer-simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using ClinCheck software.    We transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom,
three-dimensional treatment plan, called a ClinCheck treatment plan.  The ClinCheck plan simulates appropriate tooth movement broken down into a series of two-week increments, and details timing and placement of any attachments that will
be used during treatment.   Attachments are tooth-colored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement.  The patient’s
ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the Invisalign Doctor Site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch
wires and brackets.  By reviewing and amending the treatment simulation, the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan.

Construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment.    Upon the dental professional’s approval of the ClinCheck treatment plan, we use the data underlying the
simulation, in conjunction with stereolithography







technology, to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth.  Each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each two-week stage of the
simulated course of treatment.

Manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental
professional.    From these molds, aligners are fabricated by pressure-forming polymeric sheets over each mold.  Aligners are thin, clear plastic, removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series
to correspond to each two-week stage of the ClinCheck animation.  Aligners are generally worn for consecutive two-week periods which correspond to the approved ClinCheck treatment plan.  After two weeks of use, the patient
replaces them with the next pair in the series, advancing tooth movement with each aligner stage.  Throughout treatment, the doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements, per the doctor’s
original prescription and resulting ClinCheck treatment plan.

Retention.    Upon completion of the
treatment, the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our Vivera retainer product.  Vivera retainers are shipped every three months over a one year period.

Scanners and CAD/CAM Services Segment

Although advancements have been made in materials used for taking dental impressions since their introduction one hundred years ago, the overall impression process has remained relatively
unchanged.   Shortcomings such as voids, pulls, and the general margin for error have remained inherent in conventional impressions, and subsequent retakes create unnecessary cost increase for a clinical practice.  Intra-oral
scanning is an emerging technology that we believe will have substantial impact on the future of dentistry.  By enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3D image of the patient’s teeth using a handheld intra-oral scanner inside
the mouth, intra-oral scanning is more efficient and precise and more comfortable for patients, compared to the mess, discomfort, and subjective nature of taking physical impressions.  The digital model created with an intra-oral scanner
is more accurate than a physical impression and substantially reduces the rate of restoration “remakes” so patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments, which results
in greater overall patient satisfaction.

As the only intra-oral scanner system in the market based on parallel confocal
imaging, the iTero and iOC intra-oral scanners utilize laser and optical scanning to capture the contours of the patient’s dentition, gingival structures and the bite.  The intra-oral scanners capture 100,000 points of laser light in
perfect focus without the use of powder to coat the teeth, allowing for contact of the wand and tooth.  The benefit of contact scanning for the clinician is it eliminates the challenge of hovering over the teeth at a specific distance
which can be complicated.  For the patient, they enjoy a more comfortable powder free experience which allows the clinician to provide a very comfortable patient centric experience.  Within minutes, an accurate 3D digital
impression can be viewed on the screen.  The 3D digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including, fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers, inlays,
onlays, crowns, bridges and implant abutments; Invisalign digital impression submission; digital records storage; orthodontic diagnosis and computer aided placement of traditional braces; and orthodontic retainers and appliances.

Both iTero and iOC intra-oral scanners consist of a mobile computer unit, display screen, a control foot pedal and scanning wand to scan
and capture a patient’s dentition (full or partial dental arch).  System software features include occlusal map, eraser tool, edge trim tool, real-time modeling and an option to submit scans for Invisalign treatment.  The
systems provide doctors and labs with an open choice to export generic digital files of their digital impression to use with other third party dental service providers.  This allows the digital impression to integrate with cone beam CT
images for implant and orthodontic treatment planning.  OrthoCAD services are additional services available with our iOC scanner or iTero Dual scanner.  In-office training on the system and features is provided after the unit is
delivered to the practice.

deliver a new replacement retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year.  Doctors can prescribe Vivera retainers for their Invisalign and their non-Invisalign patients.

Invisalign non-case revenues.    Invisalign non-case revenues represent retainer products discussed above,
Invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products, such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment.







Feature Enhancements.Beginning in September 2009, we began
introducing enhanced features across the Invisalign system.  Referred to as Invisalign 1.5 (launched in September 2009), Invisalign G3 (launched in October 2010) and Invisalign G4 (launched in November of 2011), these feature enhancements
are a collection of clinical innovations designed to address some of the most significant treatment challenges doctors encounter. Features include:



•Precision Cuts, which are custom mesial and distal hooks used to provide anchorage for elastics and button cutouts to accommodate buttons bonded to the
tooth aimed to help treat patients with Class II and Class III malocclusion; and



•New SmartForce features engineered to achieve more predictable tooth movements using custom optimized attachments and Power Ridges.

In addition to clinical tools and enhancements, Invisalign G3 streamlined the overall treatment planning
process making it easier and more intuitive for doctors to create and modify ClinCheck treatment plans through intuitive features and drag-and-drop interfaces in ClinCheck software and a significant redesign of the Invisalign Doctor Site.

Proprietary software mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10-K such as ClinCheck software, the Invisalign Doctor Site
and enhanced features such as Invisalign G3 and Invialign G4 are included as part of the Invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue.

Scanners and CAD/CAM Services Products

Scanners

iTero Scanner.The iTero intra-oral
scanner is used by GPs, prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons and includes features for restorative procedures commonly performed in their practices such as veneers, inlays, onlays, crowns, bridges and implants The iTero restorative
software provides the ability to scan quadrants and full arches, and allows simple powder-free capture of digital impressions for single-unit cases as well as more complex restorative and implant treatment plans.  The iTero software also

4.Growth of international markets.    We will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of our products by dental professionals
in our core European markets as well as expansion into new markets.

Manufacturing and Suppliers

Our manufacturing facilities are located in Juarez, Mexico, where we produce our aligners and manufacture iTero
restorative cases, and in Or Yehuda, Israel where we produce our handheld intra-oral scanner wand.  The final assembly of our iOC and iTero scanners is performed by a third party manufacturer located in Israel.  Our digital
planning of the Invisalign system and interpretation for iTero restorative cases are conducted primarily at our facility located in San Jose, Costa Rica.  In addition, our CAD/CAM services and intra-oral scanner distribution and repair are
currently conducted in our facility in New Jersey(refer to Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under “Consolidation of New Jersey Operations” for a discussion on our plans to consolidate operations into our existing
facilities by the third quarter of 2012 and close our New Jersey facility.)In September 2011, to meet the increased demands from expected volumes, we purchased a manufacturing facility in Juarez, Mexico, adding approximately 150,000
square feet of facility space.  We are currently transitioning our aligner fabrication and intra-oral scanner–related activities from our existing facility in Juarez, Mexico into this new facility and expect to exit our existing
facility once this transition is complete.  Information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found inItem 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk
Factors.”

Our quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System regulations enforced by the
FDA, and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities.  We are certified to EN ISO 13485:2003, an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing.  We have a formal, documented
quality system by which quality objectives are defined, understood and achieved.  Systems, processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality.  We monitor the







effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes, taking corrective action, as
needed.

Since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise, we believe that
our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success.  In order to produce our highly customized, highly precise, medical quality products in volume, we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies.  These
technologies include complex software solutions, CT scanning, stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication.  To increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, we will continue to focus our efforts on software development
and the improvement of rate-limiting processes, or bottlenecks.  We continuously upgrade our proprietary, three-dimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and
judgmental tasks for each case, thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in Costa Rica.  In addition, to improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our operations, we will continue to invest in the development of
automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners.

We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized
scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials for our aligners, as well as the optics, electronic and other mechanical components of our intra-oral scanners.  We maintain single supply relationships for
many of these machines and materials technologies.  In particular, our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intra-oral scanners are provided
by single suppliers.  We are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer, the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners, from a single source.  The need to replace one of our single
source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs.   See Item 1A Risk Factors— “We maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines
and materials technologies, and our business andoperating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases.”

Sales and Marketing

Our sales efforts are focused primarily on the Invisalign system and continuing to increase adoption and utilization by orthodontists and GPs worldwide.  In North America our direct sales
organization consists of approximately 200 people, which includes quota carrying sales representatives, sales management, and sales administration.  Internationally, we have approximately 60 people engaged in sales and sales support for
the Invisalign system.  We have three distribution partners that sell the Invisalign system in smaller non-core country markets in the Asia Pacific, EMEA, and Latin America regions.  As our international business grows, we will
evaluate adding distribution partners in other non-core country markets on a case-by-case basis.  For our intra-oral scanners, we have approximately 25 direct sales representatives in North America.  Our smaller intra-oral
scanner sales team also leverages leads generated by our Invisalign sales and marketing resources, including customer events and industry trade-shows.  We also have distribution partners that sell our iTero intra-oral
scanner.  Straumann is our exclusive distribution partner for iTero scanners in Europe.

We market Invisalign by
communicating the benefits of the Invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs, online and traditional mail campaigns, trade shows, trade journals and print.  We also promote the benefits of Invisalign through
our integrated consumer marketing platform which combines traditional print and broadcast media with a balanced mix of public relations, event marketing, and social media.  The goal of this platform is to raise awareness of Invisalign and
Invisalign Teen as the best options for a healthy, beautiful smile among adults and teenagers.  In addition, our consumer marketing platform enables us to help prospective patients find a great Invisalign treatment practice that can meet
their needs.  For intra-oral scanners, in addition to leveraging Invisalign customer events and industry trade-shows to communicate the benefits of digital scanning to dental professionals, we also have training programs, educational
websites and limited print advertising.

We provide training, marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and
GPs.  We have more than 31,300 active Invisalign providers and more than 2,100 intra-oral scanner users worldwide.







Research and Development

We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing
the Invisalign system as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intra-oral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for 3D digital scans.  Our research and development expenses were $37.2 million for 2011,
$26.0 million for 2010, and $22.3 million for 2009.

Our research and development activities are directed toward
developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms.  Our research and development activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation, to developing manufacturing
process improvements, to researching future technologies and products.

In an effort to demonstrate Invisalign’s broad
treatment capabilities, various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion cases, including those of severe complexity.  We are also undertaking
post-marketing research studies as well as making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process.

Intellectual Property

We believe our intellectual property position
represents a substantial business advantage.  As of December 31, 2011, we had 256 issued U.S. patents, 132 pending U.S. patent applications, and 176 foreign issued patents, as well as 155 pending foreign patent
applications.

We continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and
non-disclosure agreements.  We also seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws.  We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent
application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products.  Our intellectual property rights may not be
successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged.  In addition, the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws.  Our
inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business.  Information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found inItem 1A of
this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”

Seasonal Fluctuations

General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and we experience seasonal trends related to
differences between our two customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve.  For example, European sales of Invisalign treatment are often weaker in the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on
holiday.  In North America, summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the
start of the school year, however, many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases.  Although we have only recently acquired our intra-oral scanner business, capital equipment sales are often stronger in
the fourth calendar quarter.  Consequently, these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause, fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.

Backlog

Due to the nature of Invisalign treatment which is prescribed by a doctor and therefore no two cases are alike, we maintain relatively low levels of backlog.  The period from which treatment
data (or “a case”) is received until the acceptance of the digital ClinCheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify, accept or cancel the treatment plan.  Therefore, we consider the
case a firm order to







manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the ClinCheck treatment plan.  Our Invisalign backlog consists of ClinCheck treatment plans that have been accepted but
not yet shipped.  Because aligners are shipped shortly after the ClinCheck treatment plan has been accepted, we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future Invisalign sales.  Our quarterly Invisalign revenues can be
impacted by the timing of the ClinCheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter.  We define our intra-oral scanner backlog as orders where payment is secured, credit and financing is approved but
the scanner has not yet shipped. Our intra-oral scanner backlog as of December 31, 2011 was not material.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive market and we encounter a wide variety of competitors, including larger companies or divisions of larger companies with substantial sales, marketing, research and
financial capabilities.  We also face competition from early stage companies.  Although the number of competitors varies by segment, currently our products compete directly against products manufactured and distributed by various
companies, both within and outside the U.S., including Danaher Corporation, 3M, Sirona Dental Systems, Inc.   and Dentsply International, Inc.  Information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found
inItem 1Aof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”

Key competitive
factors include:



•effectiveness of treatment;



•price;



•software features;



•aesthetic appeal of the treatment method;



•customer support;



•customer online interface;



•brand awareness;



•innovation;



•distribution network;



•comfort associated with the treatment method;



•oral hygiene;



•ease of use; and



•dental professionals’ chair time.

We believe that our products compare favorably with our competitors’ products with respect to each of these factors.
