ITEM 1.BUSINESS



Our Company



Align Technology, Inc. (“We”, “Our”, “Align”) is a global medical device company engaged in the design, manufacture and marketing of Invisalign® clear aligners and iTero® intraoral scanners and services for orthodontics, and restorative and aesthetic dentistry. Align’s products are intended primarily for the treatment of malocclusion or the misalignment of teeth and are designed to help dental professionals achieve the clinical outcomes that they expect. Align Technology was founded in March 1997 and incorporated in Delaware in April 1997. Our corporate headquarters is located at 2820 Orchard Parkway, San Jose, California, U.S.A., 95134, and our telephone number is 408-470-1000. Our internet address is www.aligntech.com. Our Americas regional headquarters is located in Raleigh, North Carolina, U.S.A.; our European, Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) regional headquarters is located in Rotkreuz, Switzerland, which moved from Amsterdam, the Netherlands in January 2020; and our Asia Pacific ("APAC") regional headquarters is located in Singapore.



We have two operating segments: (1) Clear Aligner and (2) Scanners and Services ("Scanner"). For the year ended December 31, 2019, Clear Aligner net revenues represented approximately 84% of worldwide net revenues, while Scanner net revenues represented the remaining 16% of worldwide net revenues. We sell the majority of our products directly to our customers: orthodontists and general practitioner dentists ("GPs"), as well as to restorative and aesthetic dentists, including prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons. We also sell through sales agents and distributors in certain countries. In addition, we sell directly to Dental Support Organizations ("DSOs") who contract with dental practices to provide critical business management and support including non-clinical operations, and we sell directly to dental laboratories who manufacture or customize a variety of products used by licensed dentists to provide oral health care.



We received 510(k) clearance from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to market the Invisalign System in 1998. The Invisalign System is regulated by the FDA as a Class II medical device. In order to provide Invisalign treatment to their patients, orthodontists and GPs must initially complete an Invisalign training course. The Invisalign System is sold primarily through a direct sales force in North America, APAC, Europe, EMEA and Latin America ("LATAM"). To date, over 8 million people worldwide have been treated with our Invisalign System.



Our iTero scanner is used by dental professionals and/or labs and service providers for restorative and orthodontic digital procedures as well as Invisalign case submission. We received 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market iTero software for expanded indications in 2013. Scanners and computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing ("CAD/CAM") services are primarily










sold through our direct sales force and through sales agents and distributors in certain countries. In addition, we sell iTero scanners and CAD/CAM services directly to DSOs.



Clear Aligner Segment



Malocclusion and Traditional Orthodontic Treatment



Malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth, is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions, affecting billions of people, or approximately 60% to 75% of the global population. Annually, approximately 12 million people in major developed countries elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide. Most orthodontic patients are treated with the use of traditional methods such as metal arch wires and brackets, referred to as braces, and may be augmented with elastics, metal expanders, headgear or functional appliances, and other ancillary devices as needed. Upon completion of the treatment, the dental professional may, at his or her discretion, have the patient use a retainer appliance. Of the 12 million annual orthodontic cases started, we estimate that approximately 75% or 8.4 million could be treated using our Invisalign clear aligners. In addition, approximately 300 million people with malocclusion could benefit from straightening their teeth. This represents an incremental opportunity for us as we expand the market for orthodontics by educating more consumers about the benefits of straighter teeth using Invisalign clear aligners and connecting them with an Invisalign doctor of their choice.



The Invisalign System



The Invisalign System is a proprietary method for treating malocclusion based on a proprietary computer-simulated virtual treatment plan and a series of doctor-prescribed, custom manufactured, clear plastic removable aligners. The Invisalign System offers a range of treatment options, specialized services, and access to proprietary software for treatment visualization and is comprised of the following phases:



Orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us. The Invisalign-trained dental professional prepares an online prescription form on our Invisalign Doctor Site and submits the patient's records, which include a digital intraoral scan or a polyvinyl-siloxane ("PVS") impression of the relevant dental arches, photographs of the patient and, at the dental professional’s election, x-rays of the patient’s dentition. Intraoral digital scans may be submitted through either Align's iTero scanner or certain third-party scanners capable of accurately interfacing with our systems and processes. See "Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission." More than 73% of Invisalign case submissions are now submitted via digital scan, increasing the accuracy of treatments, reducing the time from prescription submission to patient receipt, and decreasing the carbon footprint resulting from the shipment of the materials used to form the physical PVS impressions and shipping those PVS impressions to us.



Preparation of computer-simulated treatment plan. Using the information and digital data provided, we generate a proposed custom, three-dimensional treatment plan, called a ClinCheck treatment plan using our proprietary software, which is not for sale or license. A patient’s ClinCheck treatment plan simulates expected tooth movement in stages and details the timing and placement of any features or attachments to be used during treatment. Attachments are tooth-colored “buttons” that are sometimes used to increase the biomechanical force on a specific tooth or teeth in order to effect the desired movement(s).



Review and approval of the treatment plan by an Invisalign-trained doctor.The patient’s ClinCheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the Invisalign Doctor Site which enables the dental professional to project tooth movement from initial position to final position and compare multiple treatment plan options. By reviewing, modifying as needed and approving the treatment plan, the dental professional retains control of the patient's treatment.



Manufacture of custom aligners.Upon the dental professional’s approval of the ClinCheck treatment plan, we use the data underlying the simulation, in conjunction with stereolithography technology (a form of 3D printing technology), to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient’s teeth. Each mold is a replica of the patient’s teeth at each stage of the simulated course of treatment. From these molds, aligners are fabricated by pressure-forming polymeric sheets over each mold. Aligners are thin, clear plastic, removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each stage of the patient's ClinCheck treatment plan.



Shipment to the dental professional and patient aligner wear.In most countries, all the aligners for a patient's treatment plan are shipped directly to the dental professional, who then dispenses them to the patient at regular check-up intervals throughout the treatment. Aligners are generally worn for a period of time typically one to two weeks, corresponding to the stages of the patient’s approved ClinCheck treatment plan. The patient replaces the aligners with the next pair in the series when prescribed, advancing tooth movement through each stage. At various points in each patient’s treatment, their doctor may place attachments or use other auxiliaries to achieve desired tooth movements, per the doctor’s original prescription and the approved ClinCheck treatment plan.










At the treating doctor’s discretion, weekly aligner changes are recommended for all Invisalign treatments except for Invisalign Lite and Express packages and may provide up to 50% shorter treatment time compared with two-week aligner wear.



Feature Enhancements



We continue to introduce enhanced features across the Invisalign System to improve treatment outcomes or address broader clinical indications. For example, in 2018, we extended the Invisalign product family with Invisalign First clear aligners, designed with features specifically for younger patients with early mixed dentition (with a mixture of primary/baby and permanent teeth). Invisalign First clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition, and predictable dental arch expansion.



In 2018, we also introduced enhancements designed to improve dental professional and patient experiences and clinical outcomes including: wing overlap and engagement in deep bite cases with anterior intrusion, new options for mandibular advancement and symmetrical advancement of the left and right side, a new default protocol for incremental advancement, and improvements to support leveling the curve of Spee in deep bite cases.

Most of our Invisalign Treatment Plans described above provide dental professionals with the option to order additional aligners if the patient's treatment is not tracking against the original treatment plan. The number of additional aligner orders and timing are subject to certain requirements noted in our terms and conditions.



Comprehensive Products - Invisalign Treatment Options:



Invisalign Comprehensive. The Invisalign Comprehensive Package is used to treat adults and teens for a full spectrum of mild to severe malocclusion and contains a wide variety of Invisalign features to address the doctor's treatment goals. It also addresses the orthodontic needs of teenage patients, such as Mandibular Advancement, compliance indicators and compensation for tooth eruption.



Invisalign First Phase 1 and Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Package. Invisalign First Phase 1 is designed specifically for younger patients generally between the ages of seven and ten years, which is a mixture of primary/baby and permanent teeth. Invisalign First Phase 1 treatment provides early interceptive orthodontic treatment, traditionally done through arch expanders, or partial metal braces, before all permanent teeth have erupted. Invisalign First clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition and predictable dental arch expansion. Our Invisalign First Comprehensive Phase 2 Package is a continuation of the First Phase 1 and is generally consistent with our Invisalign Comprehensive Package. After a patient completes Invisalign First Phase I, doctors have the option to purchase a discounted Comprehensive Phase 2 Package for that same patient.



Non-Comprehensive Products - Invisalign Treatment Options:



Invisalign Non-comprehensive Products.We offer a variety of lower priced treatment packages for less complex orthodontic cases, non-comprehensive relapse cases, or straightening prior to restorative or cosmetic treatments, such as veneers. These packages may be offered in select countries and/or may differ from region to region.












Invisalign Go.We also offer Invisalign Go, a streamlined Non-Comprehensive package designed for GPs to more easily identify and treat patients with mild malocclusion. The Invisalign Go package includes case assessment support, a simplified ClinCheck treatment plan and a progress assessment feature for case monitoring.



Non-Case Products:



Clear Aligner non-case products include retention products, Invisalign training fees and sales of ancillary products, such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment.



Retention. We offer up to four sets of custom clear aligners called Vivera Retainers made with proprietary material strong enough to maintain tooth position and correct minor relapse, if necessary. Vivera Retainers are available to both Invisalign and non-Invisalign patients. In select markets, we also offer single arch retainers.



SmartTrack Aligner Material



SmartTrack is a patented, custom-engineered Invisalign clear aligner material that delivers gentle, more constant force considered ideal for orthodontic tooth movements. Conventional aligner materials relax and lose a substantial percent of energy in the initial days of aligner wear, but SmartTrack maintains more constant force over the period of time the patient wears the aligners. The flexible SmartTrack material also more precisely conforms to tooth morphology, attachments and interproximal spaces to improve control of tooth movement throughout treatment.



Scanner Segment



Intraoral scanning continues to be an evolving technology that we believe will have a substantial impact on the future of dentistry. By enabling the dental practitioner to create a 3D image of a patient's teeth (digital scan) using a handheld intraoral scanner, digital scanning is faster, more efficient, precise and comfortable for patients, compared to the discomfort and subjective nature of taking physical impressions. The accuracy of digitally scanned models substantially reduces the rate of restoration "remakes;" meaning patients are recalled less often and the appointment time for the restoration is shorter because of fewer adjustments, increasing overall patient satisfaction. Digital models also reduce the carbon footprint associated with the shipping of the materials used to create PVS impressions, the shipping of those impressions, and their disposal. Moreover, the digital model file can be used for various procedures and services including fabrication of physical dental models for use by labs to create restorative units such as veneers, inlays, onlays, crowns, bridges and implant abutments; digital records storage; orthodontic diagnosis; orthodontic retainers and appliances; and Invisalign digital impression submission.



iTero Scanner. The iTero Element scanner is available as a single hardware platform with software options for restorative or orthodontic procedures. The expanded portfolio includes the iTero Element 2 and the iTero Element Flex scanners which are each available in select regions and countries. These products build on the existing high precision, full-color imaging and fast scan times of the iTero Element portfolio while streamlining orthodontic and restorative workflows. We also continue to offer the existing iTero Element scanner in existing markets. The iTero scanner is interoperable with our Invisalign treatment such that a full arch digital scan can be submitted as part of the Invisalign case submission process.



In February 2019, we launched the iTero Element 5D Imaging system which provides a new comprehensive approach to clinical applications, workflows and user experience that expands the suite of existing high-precision, full-color imagining and fast scan times of the iTero Element portfolio.  In addition to offering all of the features and functionality that doctors have come to expect and rely on with the iTero Element 2 scanner, the iTero Element 5D scanner is the first integrated dental imaging system that simultaneously records 3D, intra-oral color and near-infrared ("NIRI") imaging and enables comparison over time using iTero TimeLapse. NIRI technology of the iTero Element 5D Imaging System aids in detection and monitoring of interproximal caries lesions above the gingiva without using harmful radiation. The iTero Element 5D Imaging System is available in the majority of EMEA and select APAC countries; however, it is pending regulatory approval in the U.S. and LATAM countries.



In June 2019, we announced the launch of iTero Element Foundation intraoral scanner with restorative software. The iTero Element Foundation extends our portfolio of intraoral scanners with powerful 3D visualization to better meet the needs of doctors, labs and patients. The iTero Element Foundation is available in North America and Japan and will be available in other select APAC and EMEA countries in 2020.



Restorative software for iTero.Our Restorative software is designed for GPs, prosthodontists, periodontists, and oral surgeons which includes restorative workflows providing them with the ability to send digital impressions to the lab of choice and communicate seamlessly with external treatment planning, custom implant abutment, chairside milling, and laboratory CAD/CAM systems.












Orthodontic software for iTero.Software designed for orthodontists for digital records storage, orthodontic diagnosis, and for the fabrication of printed models and retainers.



CAD/CAM Services and Ancillary Products



Ancillary Products. We sell disposable sleeves for the wand and other ancillary products for the iTero scanner.



iTero Models and Dies.An accurate physical model and dies are manufactured based on the digital scan and sent to the laboratory of the dentist’s choice for completion of the needed restoration. The laboratory also has the option to export the digital file for immediate production of coping and full-contour restorations on their laboratory CAD/CAM systems. The laboratory conducts then completes the ceramic buildup or staining and glazing and delivers the end result - a precisely fitting restoration. iTero prosthetics have a near-zero remake rate.



Third Party Scanners and Digital scans for Invisalign treatment submission. We accept case submissions for our clear aligner products in two ways: (1) physical impressions of the patient’s teeth or (2) intraoral scan of the patient’s teeth. With respect to intraoral scans, we accept scans from iTero scanners and certain third-party scanners that have interoperability relationship with our systems and processes.



iTero Applications and Tools



Invisalign Outcome Simulator. The Invisalign Outcome Simulator is an exclusive chair-side and cloud-based application for the iTero scanner that allows doctors to help patients visualize how their teeth may look at the end of Invisalign treatment.  This is achieved through a dual view layout that shows a prospective patient an image of his/her own current dentition next to his/her simulated final position after Invisalign treatment.



Invisalign 3D Assessment tool.The Invisalign Progress Assessment tool provides the ability to compare a patient’s new scan with a specific stage of their ClinCheck treatment plan.  This allows doctors to visually assess and communicate Invisalign treatment progress with an easy to read, color-coded tooth movement report.



TimeLapse.TimeLapse technology allows doctors or practitioners to compare a patient’s historic 3D scans to the present-day scan, enabling clinicians to identify and measure orthodontic movement, tooth wear, and gingival recession. This highlights areas of diagnostic interest to dental professionals and helps foster a proactive conversation with the patient regarding potential restorative or orthodontic solutions.



Our iTero Element, iTero Element 2, iTero Element Flex and iTero Element 5D scanners include the Invisalign Outcome Simulator, Invisalign 3D Assessment tool and Timelapse as well as the orthodontic software and/or restorative software. The orthodontic or restorative software may also be purchased subsequently for an upgrade fee. Additional applications such as the Invisalign Outcome Simulator are not available for sale separately.



Other proprietary software mentioned in this Annual Report on Form 10-K such as ClinCheck and ClinCheck Pro software, the Invisalign Doctor Site,and feature enhancements are included as part of the Invisalign System and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items to revenues.



Business Strategy



Our goal is to establish the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans. Our technology and innovations are designed to meet the demands of today’s patients with treatment options that are convenient, comfortable, affordable, while helping to improve overall oral health. We strive to help our doctors move their practices forward by connecting them with new patients, providing digital solutions to help increase practice efficiency and helping them deliver the best possible treatment outcomes and experiences to millions of people around the world. We achieve this by continued focus and execution of our strategic growth drivers as follows:



1.International Expansion.In order to provide the millions of consumers access to a better smile, we continue increasing our presence globally by making our products available in more countries. We expect to continue expanding our business by investing in resources, infrastructure, and initiatives that will drive Invisalign treatment growth in our current and new international markets. As our core international countries continue to grow in both number of new Invisalign trained doctors and customer utilization, we strive to make sure we can support that growth through investments such as headcount, clinical support, product improvements, education and advertising. We have transitioned most of our smaller country markets from an indirect to a direct sales model, and, while we do not expect a material impact from these countries for










some time, in the near term we will leverage our existing infrastructure in adjacent country markets as we build local sales and support organizations to drive long-term market penetration. In addition, we are scaling and expanding our operations and facilities to better support our customers across the globe. In 2019, we opened a new order acquisition and treatment facility in Wroclaw, Poland and a new treatment planning facility in Yokohama, Japan to support customers within these regions.

GP Adoption.



3.Patient Demand & Conversion.Our goal is to make Invisalign a highly recognized name brand worldwide by creating awareness for Invisalign treatment among consumers and motivating potential patients to seek Invisalign treatment. We accomplish this objective through an integrated consumer marketing strategy that includes television, media, social networking and event marketing and strategic alliances with professional sports teams as well as educating patients on treatment options and directing them to high volume Invisalign doctors. In January 2019, we expanded our Smile Concierge program which educates consumers on the benefits of Invisalign treatment, answers their questions and helps them schedule an appointment with an Invisalign doctor. The program simultaneously helps doctors better engage with prospective customers through more detailed customer insights. Additionally, in August 2019, we significantly increased our investment in consumer marketing in the U.S. The U.S. campaign was launched across all key media channels to over 140 million consumers, combining a robust paid media strategy across prime broadcast, cable and connected TV channels with paid search and social media.



4.Orthodontist Utilization.We continue to innovate and increase product applicability and predictability to address a wide range of cases, from simple to complex, thereby enabling doctors to confidently treat teenagers and adults with the Invisalign System. Over the last several years, we launched Invisalign Comprehensive with Mandibular Advancement and Invisalign First. We also continue to make improvements to our Invisalign treatment software, ClinCheck Pro, designed to deliver an exceptional user experience and increase treatment control to help our doctors achieve their treatment goals.



Manufacturing and Suppliers



We have manufacturing facilities located in Juarez, Mexico, where we conduct our aligner fabrication, distribution, repair of our iTero scanners and perform our CAD/CAM services. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we also began fabricating our aligners in Ziyang, China, our first aligner fabrication facility outside of Juarez, Mexico. In addition, we produce our handheld intraoral scanner wand, perform final scanner assembly and repair our scanners at our facilities in Or Yehuda, Israel and Ziyang, China. Our Invisalign digital treatment planning and interpretation for iTero restorative cases are conducted at our facilities located in San Jose, Costa Rica, Chengdu, China, Cologne, Germany, Madrid, Spain, Wroclaw, Poland and Yokohama, Japan. Information regarding risks associated with our manufacturing process and foreign operations may be found inItem 1Aof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading“Risk Factors.”



Our quality system is required to be in compliance with the Quality System regulations enforced by the FDA, and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory authorities. We are certified to EN ISO 13485:2003, an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing. We have a formal, documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined, understood and achieved. Systems, processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality. We monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes, taking corrective action, as needed.












Since the manufacturing process of our products requires substantial and varied technical expertise, we believe that our manufacturing capabilities are important to our success. In order to produce our highly customized, highly precise, medical quality products in volume, we have developed a number of proprietary processes and technologies. These technologies include complex software algorithms and solutions, CT scanning, stereolithography and automated aligner fabrication. To increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes, we continue to focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of rate-limiting processes or bottlenecks. We continuously upgrade our proprietary, three-dimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case, thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians. In addition, to improve efficiency and increase the scale of our operations, we continue to invest in the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners.



We are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment, rapid prototyping machines, resin and other advanced materials for our aligners, as well as the optics, electronic and other mechanical components of our intraoral scanners. We maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies. In particular, our CT scanning and stereolithography equipment used in our aligner manufacturing and many of the critical components for the optics of our intraoral scanners are provided by single suppliers. We are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer, the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process for clear aligners, from a single source. The need to replace one of our single source suppliers could cause a disruption in our ability to timely deliver certain of our products or increase costs. For a discussion of the risks of our supply and manufacturing operations, seeItem 1ARisk Factors.



Sales and Marketing



Our sales efforts are focused on increasing adoption and utilization of the Invisalign System by orthodontists and GPs worldwide and integrating the iTero scanner into the doctors practice. The scanner is an important component to the customer experience and is central to a digital approach as well as overall customer utilization of Invisalign treatments. In each region, we have direct sales and support organizations, which include quota carrying sales representatives, sales management and sales administration. We also have distribution partners in certain markets. In the EMEA region, we segmented sales and marketing for certain country markets into two separate organizations to serve each customer segment, orthodontists and GP dentists separately, thereby increasing our focus and effectiveness on GP dentists. We continue to expand in existing markets through targeted investments in sales resources, professional marketing and education programs, along with consumer marketing in select countries.



We provide training, marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and GPs. As of December 31,2019, we had approximately 96,000 active Invisalign trained doctors, which we define as having submitted at least one case in the prior 12 month period.



Research and Development



We are committed to investing in world-class technology development, which we believe is critical to achieving our goal of establishing the Invisalign System as the standard method for treating malocclusion and our intraoral scanning platform as the preferred scanning protocol for digital scans.



Our research and development activities are directed toward developing the technology innovations that we believe will deliver our next generation of products and platforms. These activities range from accelerating product and clinical innovation to developing manufacturing process improvements to researching future technologies and products.



In an effort to demonstrate the broad treatment capabilities of the Invisalign System, various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the clinical applicability of Invisalign to malocclusion cases, including those of severe complexity. We undertake pre-commercialization trials and testing of our technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process.



Intellectual Property



We believe our intellectual property portfolio represents a substantial business advantage. As ofDecember 31, 2019, we had 489 active U.S. patents, 462 active foreign patents, and 559 pending global patent applications. Our active U.S. patents expire between 2020 and 2039. When patents expire, we lose the protection and competitive advantages they provided to us, which could negatively impact our operating results; however, we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through U.S. and foreign patent applications and non-disclosure agreements. We also seek to protect our software, documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will remain valid and enforceable or sufficient to protect our technology or products. Our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. In addition, the laws of various foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws. Our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business. Information










regarding risks associated with our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found inItem 1Aof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading“Risk Factors.”



Seasonal Fluctuations



General economic conditions impact our business and financial results, and we experience seasonal trends within our two operating segments, customer channels and the geographic locations that we serve. Sales of Invisalign treatments are often weaker in Europe during the summer months due to our customers and their patients being on holiday and seasonally higher in China during the third quarter, particularly related to increased teen cases. Similarly, other international holidays like Chinese New Year can also negatively impact our sales in APAC. In North America, summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teenagers started in treatment before the start of the school year; however, many GPs are on vacation during this time and therefore tend to start fewer cases. For our Scanner segment, capital equipment sales are often stronger in the fourth calendar quarter. Consequently, these seasonal trends have caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates.



Backlog



All Invisalign treatments are individually unique and prescribed by a doctor so, no two cases are alike. The period from which a treatment data package (or a "case”) is received until the acceptance of the digital ClinCheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional’s discretion to modify, accept or cancel the treatment plan. Therefore, we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the ClinCheck treatment plan. Our Invisalign backlog consists of ClinCheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped. Because aligners are shipped shortly after the ClinCheck treatment plan has been accepted, we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future clear aligner revenues. Our quarterly clear aligner revenues can be impacted by the timing of the ClinCheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter. We define our iTero scanner backlog as orders where credit and financing are generally approved and payment is reasonably assured but the scanner has not yet shipped. Our Invisalign and iTero scanner backlogs as ofDecember 31, 2019were immaterial.

Government Regulation



Many countries throughout the world have established regulatory framework for commercialization of medical devices. As a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of medical devices, we are obligated to comply with the respective framework of these countries to obtain and maintain access to these global markets. The framework often defines requirements for premarket authorizations which vary from country to country. Failure to obtain appropriate premarket authorization and to meet all local requirements including specific safety standards in any country in which we currently market our products could cause commercial disruption and/or subject us to sanctions and fines. Delays in receipt of, or a failure to receive, such premarket authorizations, or the loss of any previously received premarket authorizations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.



With regards to premarket authorization in the U.S., our products are classified as medical devices under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FD&C Act"). The FD&C Act requires these products, when sold in the U.S., to be safe and effective for their intended use and to comply with medical device regulations defined by the FDA. This regulatory framework is comparable to the framework established in the European Union ("EU"). Within the EU, our products are subject to the requirements defined by the Medical Device Directive which is generally consistent with FDA regulations.



We believe we are in compliance with all state, federal, and international regulatory requirements that are applicable to our products.



We are also subject to various laws inside and outside the U.S. concerning our relationships with healthcare professionals and government officials, price reporting and regulation, the promotion, sales and marketing of our products and services, the importation and exportation of our products, the operation of our facilities and distribution of our products. As a global company, we are subject to varying degrees of government regulation in the various countries in which we do business, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent oversight and enforcement. Initiatives sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies, and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare expenses generally are ongoing in markets where we do business. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business.



Our customers are healthcare providers that may be reimbursed by federal funded programs such as Medicaid or a foreign national healthcare program, each of which may offer some degree of oversight. Many government agencies, both domestic and foreign, have increased their enforcement activities with respect to healthcare providers and companies in recent years.  Enforcement actions and associated defense can be expensive, and any resulting findings carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.



In addition, we must comply with numerous data protection requirements that span from individual state and national laws in the U.S. to multinational requirements in the EU. In the U.S., final regulations implementing amendments to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) became effective in the latter part of 2013 with the HIPAA Omnibus Rule. We are also required to be in compliance with the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect in January 2020. In the EU, we must comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which serves as a harmonization of European data-privacy laws. Further expansion into LATAM markets will require us to prepare for Brazil's Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados ("LGPD") scheduled to take effect in August 2020. Meanwhile, the APAC and EMEA regions have also seen rapid development of privacy laws including India, Russia, China, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and Australia.



We believe we have designed our product and service offerings to be compliant with the requirements of applicable data protection laws and regulations. Maintaining systems that are compliant with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our customers and their patients.  Additionally, our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare providers in managing data protection requirements. Information regarding risks associated with data security and privacy may be found inItem 1Aof this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading “Risk Factors.”



Employees



As ofDecember 31, 2019, we had approximately 14,530 employees, including 9,470 in manufacturing and operations, 2,880 in sales and marketing which includes customer care, 800 in research and development and 1,380 in general and administrative functions.
