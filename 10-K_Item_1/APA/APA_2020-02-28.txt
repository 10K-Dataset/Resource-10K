ITEMS 1 and 2.BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

GENERAL

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. Apache’s midstream business is operated by Altus Midstream Company (ALTM) through its subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus). Altus owns, develops, and operates a midstream energy asset network in the Permian Basin of West Texas, anchored by midstream service contracts to Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. Additionally, Altus owns equity interests in a total of four Permian Basin pipelines that will access various points along the Texas Gulf Coast, providing it with fully integrated, wellhead-to-water connectivity.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Our VISION is to be the premier exploration and production company, contributing to global progress by helping meet the world's energy needs.

Our MISSION is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders.

Our STRATEGY is to take a differentiated approach to the exploration and production of cost-advantaged hydrocarbons through innovation, technology, optimization, continuous improvement, and relentless focus on costs to deliver top-tier, long-term returns.

Rigorous management of the Company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term. Over the past several years, Apache has entered into a series of transactions that have upgraded its portfolio of assets, enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize investment returns, and increased focus on internally generated exploration with full-cycle, returns-focused growth. These efforts included the monetization of certain non-strategic assets, including gas-weighted properties in the Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region and selling other non-core leasehold positions. The Company made strategic decisions to allocate the proceeds of these divestitures to more impactful development opportunities across its portfolio and exploration efforts in Suriname. In addition, in November 2018 the Company completed a transaction with Altus Midstream Company and its then wholly owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP to create a publicly traded, pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation anchored by gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. This transaction facilitated funding the capital requirements for midstream infrastructure and led to the acquisition of equity interests in four Permian Basin long-haul pipeline entities.

Apache’s U.S. upstream oil and gas assets are complemented by its international assets in Egypt and the North Sea, each of which adds to the Company’s inventory of exploration and development opportunities and generates cash flows in excess of current








capital investments, providing the Company greater ability to develop its onshore Permian Basin properties while maintaining financial flexibility in a volatile commodity price environment. Apache’s diverse regional portfolio and asset inventory includes, at scale, both conventional and unconventional resources covering oil, rich gas with NGLs, and lean gas. This range of assets provides optionality to fund a capital program capable of delivering a sustainable combination of long-term returns with a moderate pace of growth.

For a more in-depth discussion of the Company’s2019results, divestitures, strategy, and its capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

The following business overview further describes the operations and activities for the Company’s upstream exploration and production properties, by geographic region, and Altus midstream. Apache has historically employed a decentralized, geographic region-focused approach to operations. In recent years, the Company has centralized certain operational activities in an effort to capture greater efficiencies through shared services. In light of the continued streamlining of the Company’s asset portfolio through divestitures and strategic transactions, in late 2019 management initiated a comprehensive redesign of Apache’s organizational structure and operations that it believes will better position the Company to be competitive for the long-term and further reduce recurring costs. The reorganization is ongoing and is expected to be substantially completed for the technical functions by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Changes for the corporate support functions will be ongoing through most of 2020.

UPSTREAM EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION PROPERTIES

Operating Areas

Apache has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and the North Sea. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname and other international locations that may, over time, result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key2019data for each of Apache’s operating areas. Additional data and discussion are provided in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

(1)Apache’s operations in Egypt, excluding the impacts of a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed21 percentof2019production and accounted for13 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves.

(2)Sales volumes from the North Sea for2019were21.8MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

United States

In2019, Apache’s U.S. upstream oil and gas operations contributed approximately59 percentof production and68 percentof estimated year-end proved reserves. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 5.2 million gross acres in the U.S., 78 percent of which are undeveloped.








Permian RegionThe Permian region located in West Texas and New Mexico includes the Permian sub-basins: Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays within this region include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry. The Permian region is one of Apache’s core growth areas. Highlights of the Company’s operations in the region include:

•Over 2.9 million gross acres (1.8 million net acres) with exposure to numerous plays focused primarily in the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and the Delaware Basin.

•Estimated proved reserves of 665.8 MMboe at year-end 2019, representing 66 percent of the Company’s worldwide proved reserves.

•In 2019, the Permian region averaged 11 rigs and drilled or participated in 232 wells, 206 of which were horizontal, with a 100 percent success rate.

•Annual production of254.3Mboe/d increased21 percentfrom 2018. Fourth-quarter 2019 production increased13 percentfrom the prior sequential quarter and22 percentfrom the fourth quarter of 2018, a reflection of the success of the Company’s Midland Basin oil-focused drilling program and production from its Alpine High field.

In late 2016, Apache announced the discovery of a new resource play, “Alpine High.” Apache’s Alpine High acreage lies in the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas, and contains multiple geologic formations and target zones spanning the full hydrocarbon phase window from dry gas to wet gas to oil. Over the past two years, the Company focused on geological testing and transitioned to initial tests of full-field development of the Alpine High play, drilling 100 wells and 82 wells in 2018 and 2019, respectively. Given the prevailing gas and NGL price environment and disappointing performance of recent multi-well development pads in the second half of 2019, Apache materially reduced planned investment and currently has no future drilling plans at Alpine High.

Permian region drilling activity outside of Alpine High primarily focused in the Southern Midland Basin, with an average of 3.5 rigs running throughout the year targeting oil plays in the Wolfcamp, Spraberry, and lower Cline formations. The region also ran an average of 1.5 rigs during 2019 on the Company’s Delaware Basin acreage in New Mexico focused on oil plays in the Bone Spring formation. For 2019, the region drilled or participated in 150 wells excluding Alpine High activity, with a 100 percent success rate. Since 2017, the region has operated its unconventional oil-focused program at a relatively steady and deliberate pace. This has generated competitive well results, solid returns, and an attractive oil production growth rate. For 2020, the Company plans to reduce its operated rig count in the Permian region but deliver on a low-to-mid-single digit oil growth rate.

Midcontinent/Gulf Coast RegionThe Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region has historically included developed and undeveloped acreage in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas. In the second quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the Woodford-SCOOP and STACK plays for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately$223 million. In the third quarter of 2019, Apache completed the sale of non-core, gas-weighted assets in the western Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma and Texas for aggregate cash proceeds of approximately$322 millionand the assumption of asset retirement obligations of $49 million. The asset sales reflect the divestiture of a significant portion of the Company’s Midcontinent/Gulf Coast onshore region and further streamlines Apache’s portfolio. The region retained acreage of approximately 664,000 gross acres (263,000 net acres) and nearly 240 gross wells (150 net), primarily located in Eagle Ford shale and Austin Chalk areas of Southeast Texas.

Gulf of Mexico RegionThe Gulf of Mexico region comprises assets in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana. In addition to its interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases, when the Company sold in 2013 substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50 percent ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in development blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. During 2019, Apache’s Gulf of Mexico region continued to operate on a reduced capital budget, having participated in 2 non-operated exploratory wells with an average 15 percent working interest, both of which were successful. The region contributed4.7Mboe/d to the Company’s total production for the year.

U.S. MarketingIn general, most of the Company’s U.S. natural gas production is sold at either monthly or daily index-based prices. The tenor of the Company’s sales contracts span from daily to multi-year transactions. Natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution, utility, and midstream companies as well as end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Beginning in 2017, Apache began selling gas to markets in Mexico and to LNG export facilities in the U.S.








Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil production to integrated major oil companies, marketing, and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price or other regional pricing indices (e.g. WTI Houston, West Texas Sour (WTS), or WTI Midland), adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential.

Apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts. These term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide for a higher than prevailing market price.

Apache’s U.S. NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on Gulf Coast supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

U.S. Delivery CommitmentsThe Company has entered into long-term delivery commitments for natural gas and crude oil, which require Apache to deliver an average of 270 Bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2020 through 2029 at variable, market-based pricing and deliver an average of 6.7 MMbbl of crude oil per year from 2020 through 2025 at variable, market-based pricing.

Apache currently expects to fulfill its delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves, production from continued development and/or spot market purchases as necessary. Apache may also enter into contractual arrangements to reduce its delivery commitments. The Company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its delivery commitments.

For more information regarding the Company’s commitments, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Contractual Obligations.

International

In2019, international assets contributed41 percentof Apache’s production and56 percentof oil and gas revenues.Approximately32 percentof estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside the U.S.

Apache has two international regions:

•The Egypt region, which includes onshore conventional assets in Egypt’s Western Desert.

•The North Sea region, which includes offshore assets based in the United Kingdom.

The Company also has an offshore exploration program in Suriname.

EgyptApache has 24 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end2019, the Company held 5.1 million gross acres in 24 separate concessions.Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 4 to 24 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 70 percent of the Company’s gross acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing Apache with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future.

Apache’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the contractor partner (Contractor) bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache’s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache’s production and reserves.








The Company’s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves. In addition, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas operations in Egypt. The Egypt region, including the one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed28 percentof2019production and19 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves. Excluding the impacts of the noncontrolling interest, Egypt contributed21 percentof2019production and13 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves.

In2019, the region drilled 41 development and 23 exploration wells. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache’s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations. The Company has completed seismic surveys covering over 3 million acres to date. The region continues to build and enhance its drilling inventory, supplemented with recent seismic acquisitions and new play concept evaluations, on both new and existing acreage. Heading into 2020, the region plans to advance its large-scale seismic shoot and continue to build its prospect inventory.

North SeaApache has interests in approximately 419,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. The region contributed13 percentof Apache’s2019production and approximately13 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4-D seismic. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Ness, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and a non-operated interest in the Maclure field. Apache also has a non-operated interest in the Nelson field acquired in 2011. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. The North Sea region plays a strategic role in Apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with high-impact exploration potential.

During2019, the region drilled 11 development wells with a 100 percent success rate: five platform wells in the Forties field, three platform wells in the Beryl field, and three subsea wells in the Beryl area.

The North Sea region’s Storr exploration discovery came on-line in the fourth quarter of 2019, and its second well at Garten came on-line in the first quarter of 2020. The first well at the Company’s Storr development is a high-rate gas condensate well that is tied back to existing infrastructure at the Beryl Alpha platform. The Garten #2 well encountered approximately 1,200 feet of net pay and compares favorably to the Garten #1 well, which came on-line in November 2018 with initial 30-day production rates of 13 Mb/d and 17 MMcf/d from 700 feet of net pay. Apache holds a 100 percent working interest in the Garten complex.

In 2020, the Company plans to run one to two platform rigs in the North Sea between the Forties and Beryl assets as well as a semi-submersible rig drilling principally in the Beryl area where the Company has short-cycle subsea tie-back opportunities.

International MarketingApache’s natural gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is sold and exported from one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices related to the export market.

Apache’s North Sea crude oil production is sold under term, entitlement volume contracts and fixed volume spot contracts with a market-based index price plus a differential to capture the higher market value under each type of arrangement. Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) gas plant, which Apache divested to Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited in late 2017. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.

Other Exploration

New VenturesApache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins.








In December 2019, Apache entered into a joint venture agreement with Total S.A. to explore and develop Block 58 offshore Suriname. Apache holds a 50 percent working interest in Block 58, which comprises approximately 1.4 million acres in water depths ranging from less than 100 meters to more than 2,100 meters. During 2019, the Company drilled an exploration well, the Maka Central-1, in Block 58 and announced a significant oil discovery in January 2020. The well successfully tested for the presence of hydrocarbons in multiple stacked targets in the upper Cretaceous-aged Campanian and Santonian intervals and encountered both oil and gas condensate. The Company began drilling its second exploration well, Sapakara West-1, in January 2020. Following completion of the Sapakara West-1, the Company will drill a third, and likely a fourth exploration test in Block 58 during 2020.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in2019, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 315 gross wells, with 299 (95 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache’s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, Apache’s operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to Apache’s completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 105 gross (99.8 net) in the U.S., 25 gross (23.7 net) in Egypt, 5 gross (3.8 net) in the North Sea, and 1 gross (0.5 net) in Suriname.

Gross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out Apache’s gross and net acreage position as ofDecember 31, 2019, in each country where the Company has operations:

As ofDecember 31, 2019, approximately 19 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage was held by production.

As ofDecember 31, 2019, Apache had 257,000 net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire by year-end2020if production is not established or Apache takes no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 1.4 million and 561,000 net undeveloped acres set to expire in2021and2022, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments.










Exploration concessions in Apache’s Egypt region comprise a significant portion of Apache’s net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. Apache has 98,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in Egypt during2020. Approximately 1.3 million and 98,000 net undeveloped acres are set to expire in2021and2022, respectively. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist.

Additionally, Apache has exploration interests in Suriname consisting of 390,000 net undeveloped acres in Block 53 and 720,000 net undeveloped acres in Block 58 set to expire in 2022 and 2026, respectively, contingent on planned drilling activity. Apache has acquired 3-D seismic surveys over all the acreage. No reserves have been booked on this undeveloped acreage.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.










The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as ofDecember 31, 2019, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in2019, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

(1)Includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of59MMboe and5MMboe, respectively, attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt.

As ofDecember 31, 2019, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of551MMbbls of crude oil,186MMbbls of NGLs, and1.6Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of1.0 billionbarrels of oil or 6.1 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 55 percent. As ofDecember 31, 2019, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled893MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled118MMboe, or approximately 12 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing. The Company does not have any fields that contain 15 percent or more of its total proved reserves for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.

During2019, Apache added176MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity, partially offset by combineddownwardrevisions of previously estimated reserves of119MMboe. Engineering and performance upward revisions accounted for20MMboe and downward revisions related to changes in product prices accounted for139MMboe. The Company also sold 107 MMboe of proved reserves associated with U.S. divestitures, primarily related to the sale of the Company’s Woodford-SCOOP and STACK plays and western Anadarko Basin assets.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as ofDecember 31, 2019,2018, and2017, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 18—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of118MMboe as ofDecember 31, 2019, decreased by 35 MMboe from 153 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at the end of2018. During the year, Apache converted 85 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In the U.S., Apache converted 72 MMboe, with the remaining 13 MMboe in Apache’s international areas. Apache sold 18 MMboe of PUD reserves in the U.S. and did not acquire any PUD reserves during the year. Apache added 119 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Apache recognized a 7 MMboe upward engineering revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year. Downward engineering revisions included 28 MMboe associated with product prices, 29 MMboe associated with revised development plans, and 1 MMboe associated with interest revisions.








During the year, a total of approximately $1.0 billion was spent on projects associated with proved undeveloped reserves. A portion of Apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will convert undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves in future years. During 2019, Apache spent approximately $749 million on PUD reserve development activity in the U.S. and $264 million in the international areas. As ofDecember 31, 2019, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure.

Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry. The Executive Vice President of Development, Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. The Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to conduct a reserves audit, which includes a review of our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During2019, the properties selected for each country ranged from 83 to 95 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 91 percent of the reserves value of Apache’s international proved reserves and 95 percent of the reserves value of Apache’s new wells drilled worldwide. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The review covered 85 percent of total proved reserves by volume.

Ryder Scott’s review for the years2019,2018, and2017covered 87, 86, and 92 percent, respectively, of the value and 85, 83, and 84 percent, respectively, of the volume of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s2019review covered 85, 86, and 80 percent of the estimated proved reserve volume in the U.S., Egypt, and U.K., respectively.

Ryder Scott’s review of2018covered 82 percent of U.S., 85 percent of Egypt, and 81 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of2017covered 84 percent of U.S., 85 percent of Egypt, and 81 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

The Company has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.








ALTUS MIDSTREAM ASSETS

In November 2018, Apache completed a transaction with Altus Midstream Company and its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus) to create a pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation anchored by gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. Pursuant to the agreement, Apache contributed certain Alpine High midstream assets and options to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects (the Pipeline Options) to Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries. In exchange for the assets, Apache received economic voting and non-economic voting shares in Altus Midstream Company and limited partner interests in Altus Midstream LP, representing an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in the combined entities.

Apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of Altus in its consolidated financial statements, with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately.

Gathering, Processing, and Transmission Assets

Altus owns, develops, and operates gas gathering, processing, and transmission assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Altus generates revenue by providing fee-based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transmission services for Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. As of December 31, 2019, Altus’ assets included approximately 178 miles of in-service natural gas gathering pipelines, approximately 55 miles of residue-gas pipelines with four market connections, and approximately 38 miles of NGL pipelines. Three cryogenic processing trains, each with nameplate capacity of 200 MMcf/d, were placed into service during 2019. Other assets include an NGL truck loading terminal with six Lease Automatic Custody Transfer units and eight NGL bullet tanks with 90,000 gallon capacity per tank. Altus’ existing gathering, processing, and transmission infrastructure is expected to provide capacity levels capable of fulfilling its midstream contracts to service Apache’s production from Alpine High and additional third-party customers as the market activity in the area continues to develop.

Apache, as part of its fourth quarter 2019 capital planning review, notified Altus of its intention to materially reduce funding to Alpine High. This notification prompted Altus management to assess its long-lived infrastructure assets for impairment given the expected reduction to future throughput volumes. Altus subsequently recorded impairments on its gathering, processing, and transmission assets. For further discussion of these impairments, please see Note 1 “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in within Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Pipeline Options and Equity Interests

Gulf Coast Express PipelineIn December 2018, Altus Midstream LP closed on the exercise of its option to acquire a 15 percent equity interest in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline (GCX) from Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC (Kinder Morgan). Altus Midstream LP acquired an additional 1 percent equity interest in May 2019, for a total 16 percent equity interest in GCX. GCX is a long-haul natural gas pipeline with capacity of approximately 2.0 Bcf/d and transports natural gas from the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas to the Agua Dulce Hub near the Texas Gulf Coast. GCX is operated by Kinder Morgan and was placed into service in September 2019.

EPIC Crude Oil PipelineIn March 2019, Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary closed on the exercise of its option with EPIC Pipeline LP, thereby acquiring a 15 percent equity interest in the EPIC crude oil pipeline (EPIC). The long-haul crude oil pipeline extends from the Orla area in northern Reeves County, Texas to the Port of Corpus Christi, Texas, and has Permian Basin initial throughput capacity of approximately 600 Mb/d. The project includes terminals in Orla, Pecos, Crane, Wink, Midland, Hobson, and Gardendale, Texas with Port of Corpus Christi connectivity and export access. It services Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, and Eagle Ford Shale production. EPIC is operated by EPIC Consolidated Operations, LLC and was commissioned in February 2020.

Permian Highway PipelineIn May 2019, Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary closed on the exercise of its option with Kinder Morgan, thereby acquiring an approximate 26.7 percent equity interest in the Permian Highway Pipeline (PHP). Upon completion, the long-haul natural gas pipeline is expected to have capacity of approximately 2.1 Bcf/d and will transport natural gas from the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas to the Katy, Texas area with connections to U.S. Gulf Coast and Mexico markets. PHP will be operated by Kinder Morgan and is expected to be in service in early 2021.

Shin Oak NGL PipelineIn July 2019, Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary closed on the exercise of its option with Enterprise Products Operating LLC (Enterprise Products), thereby acquiring a 33 percent equity interest in Breviloba LLC, which owns Shin Oak NGL Pipeline (Shin Oak). The long-haul NGL pipeline has capacity of up to 550 Mb/d and transports NGL production from the Orla area in northern Reeves County, Texas through the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas, and on to Mont Belvieu, Texas. Shin Oak is operated by Enterprise Products and was placed into service during 2019.








Pipeline Option Outstanding

Salt Creek NGL PipelineAltus Midstream LP’s subsidiary’s option to acquire a 50 percent equity interest in the Salt Creek NGL Pipeline, an intra-basin NGL pipeline, was originally set to expire on January 31, 2020; however, the parties executed an extension for the option until March 2, 2020.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT APACHE

Response Plans and Available Resources

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations and offshore operations in the North Sea and Suriname, which ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans.








Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRL’s services. Apache also has a contract for response resources and services with National Response Corporation (NRC). NRC is the world’s largest commercial Oil Spill Response Organization and is the global leader in providing end-to-end environmental, industrial, and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries.

In the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico.

Additionally, Apache is an active member of Wild Well Control’s WellCONTAINED Subsea Containment System for Suriname operations. This membership includes contingency planning, and response, to an uncontrolled subsea well event. Apache utilizes a detailed Source Control Emergency Response Plan (SCERP) for offshore Suriname planning. The SCERP has been designed to ensure that the goals of Apache’s source control emergency preparedness efforts will be met in the unlikely event of an actual response to an uncontrolled well event. This includes the use of subsea dispersant systems and field deployment of one of Wild Well Control’s containment system capping stacks.

Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across three geographic areas, our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
