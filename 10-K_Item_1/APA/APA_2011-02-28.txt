General



Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an
    independent energy company that explores for, develops and
    produces natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids. We
    currently have exploration and production interests in seven
    countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, Australia, offshore the
    United Kingdom in the North Sea, Argentina, and Chile.

We hold interests in many of our U.S., Canadian and other
    international properties through subsidiaries. Properties to
    which we refer in this document may be held by those
    subsidiaries. We treat all operations as one line of business.
    References to “Apache” or the “Company”

    unless otherwise specifically stated.



Growth
    Strategy



Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable global exploration
    and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible
    manner for the long-term benefit of our stockholders.
    Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, with
    the following core strategic components:



•balanced portfolio of core assets;•conservative capital structure; and•rate of return focus.



Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have
    underpinned our ability to deliver long-term production and
    reserve growth and achieve competitive investment rates of
    return for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased
    reserves 22 out of the last 25 years and production 30 out
    of the past 32 years, a testament to our consistency over
    the long-term.





Apache pursues opportunities for growth through exploration and
    development drilling, supplemented by occasional strategic
    acquisitions. In the years immediately prior to 2010, we were
    relatively absent from the acquisition market. We believed the
    market was overheated as oil and gas prices spiked, and the
    opportunities we identified did not meet our criteria for risk,
    reward, rate of returnand/orgrowth potential. We built our cash position while drilling from
    our existing inventory of prospects and waiting for the right
    transactions to add to our portfolio. During 2010 we completed
    more than $11 billion in acquisitions and made significant
    progress with exploitation on existing core properties.



The current-year acquisitions fit well with our long-term
    strategy of maintaining a balanced portfolio of core assets.
    They included high-quality assets with a diversity of geologic
    and geographic risk, product mix and reserve life. The
    properties are strategically positioned with our existing
    infrastructure and play to the strengths that come with our
    experience operating in the Permian Basin, Canada and Gulf of
    Mexico (GOM). The Mariner merger also provided a strategic
    position in the deepwater GOM, which is relatively under
    explored and oil prone and gives Apache exposure to significant
    domestic oil reserves. The transactions drove a 42 percent,
    or 10 million acre,year-over-yearincrease in our undeveloped gross acres, adding to our inventory
    of future drilling and exploration opportunities.



    Acquisitions



North
    America



Shelf acquisitionOn June 9, 2010, Apache
    completed the acquisition of oil and gas assets in the Gulf of
    Mexico shelf from Devon Energy Corporation for
    $1.05 billion.



Mariner mergerOn November 10, 2010,
    Apache completed the acquisition of Mariner Energy, Inc. for
    stock and cash consideration totaling $2.7 billion. We also
    assumed approximately $1.7 billion of Mariner’s debt
    with the merger.



Permian acquisitionOn August 10, 2010,
    we completed the acquisition of BP plc’s (BP) oil and gas
    operations, acreage and infrastructure in the Permian Basin for
    $2.5 billion, net of preferential rights to purchase.



Canadian acquisitionOn October 8, 2010,
    we completed the acquisition of substantially all of BP’s
    upstream natural gas business in western Alberta and British
    Columbia for $3.25 billion.



International



Egyptian acquisitionOn November 4, 2010,
    we completed the acquisition of BP’s assets in Egypt’s
    Western Desert for $650 million.



Balanced
    Portfolio of Core Assets



A cornerstone of our long-term strategy is balancing our
    portfolio of assets through diversity of geologic risk,
    geographic risk, hydrocarbon mix (crude oil versus natural gas),
    and reserve life in order to achieve consistency in results. Our
    portfolio of geographic locations provides variation of all of
    these factors. We have exploration and production operations in
    seven countries, spanning five continents: the Gulf Coast,
    Permian and Central regions of the U.S., Canada, Egypt, the U.K.
    North Sea, Australia, Argentina and on the Chilean side of the
    island of Tierra del Fuego. Our 2010 acquisitions added to our
    asset base in the United States, Canada, and Egypt.



In addition, each of our producing regions has achieved an
    economy of scale providing a vehicle for cost-effective base
    production and a combination of lower- and medium-risk drilling
    opportunities. The net cash provided by operating activities
    (cash flows) generated by our current production base funds our
    drilling and development capital program, giving us the ability
    to pursue new exploration targets over our 35 million gross
    undeveloped acres across the globe and develop our pipeline of
    exploration discoveries. Those developments will fund the next
    round of exploration activities and development programs.



In 2010:



•No single region contributed more than 28 percent of our
    equivalent production or revenue.•No single region held more than 26 percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves.







•The mixture of reserve life (estimated reserves divided by
    annual production) in our countries, which translates into
    balance in the timing of returns on our investments, ranges from
    as short as five years to as long as 25 years.



Our balanced product mix provides a measure of protection
    against price deterioration in a given product while retaining
    upside potential through a significant increase in either
    commodity price. In 2010 crude oil and liquids provided
    52 percent of our production and 77 percent of our
    revenue.



•At year-end our estimated proved reserves were 44 percent
    crude oil and liquids and 56 percent natural gas.•Our international gas portfolio, which accounted for
    19 percent of our 2010 worldwide equivalent production,
    positions us to take advantage of increasing prices in Argentina
    and Australia.



Conservative
    Capital Structure



Maintaining a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility is
    a core strategic component of our long-term strategy. We believe
    our balance sheet, and the financial flexibility it provides, is
    one of our most important strategic assets. Maintaining a strong
    balance sheet underpins our ability to weather commodity price
    volatility and has enabled us to deliverlong-termproduction and reserves growth throughout the cycles of our
    industry. It is also key in positioning us to pursue
    value-creating acquisitions when opportunities arise, as they
    did in 2010.



We exited 2010 with adebt-to-capitalizationratio of 25 percent, an increase of only one percent
    despite current year capital investments of $17 billion,
    and $2.4 billion of available committed borrowing capacity.



Rate
    of Return Focus



Another core component to our long-term strategy is focusing onrate-of-return.We do so through centralized management and incentive systems,
    decentralized decision making, strict cost control, and the
    creative application of technology.



Our centralized management and incentive systems provide a
    uniform process of measuring success across Apache. They
    incentivize highrate-of-returnactivities but allow for appropriate risk-taking to drive future
    growth. Results of operations and rates of return on invested
    capital are measured monthly, reviewed with management
    quarterly, and utilized to determine annual performance awards.
    We review capital allocations, at least quarterly, utilizing
    estimates of internally-generated cash flow. We do this through
    a disciplined and focused process that includes analyzing
    current economic conditions, projected rates of return on
    internally-generated drilling prospects, opportunities for
    tactical acquisitions, land positions with additional drilling
    prospects or, occasionally, new core areas that could enhance
    our portfolio.



We also use technology to reduce risk, decrease time and costs
    and maximize recoveries from reservoirs. Apache scientists and
    engineers have been granted numerous patents for a range of
    inventions, from systems used for interpreting seismic data and
    processing well logs to improvements in drilling and completion
    techniques.



One such example is a manifold developed for our Horn River
    Shale gas play in northeast British Columbia, where Apache is
    employing pad-drilling technology. Apache engineers developed
    and applied for a patent on a manifold that can connect all
    horizontal wells on a single pad, driving down costs by reducing
    non-productive time on our24-hour-a-dayhydraulic fracturing operations. This technology will reduce
    costs and increase Apache’s rate of return on potentially
    thousands of future wells across our leasehold.



At our Forties field in the North Sea, Apache is using
    techniques that bring together many sources of data to give an
    accurate view of the current state of the field and identify
    likely places to find unswept oil deposits. Four-dimensional
    modeling, which uses reservoir engineering data and a series of3-Dseismic
    surveys, is utilized by Apache to create a time-lapse picture
    that shows where oil remains after more than 35 years of
    production. The latest model of the reservoir highlights the
    potential for stranded oil accumulations and enhances the
    success of the ongoing drilling program as well as identifies
    new potential drilling locations.

North
    America



Apache’s North American asset base comprises the Gulf
    Coast, Permian and Central regions of the U.S. and its
    operations in Canada. In 2010 our North America assets
    contributed 48 percent of our production and
    44 percent of our oil and gas production revenues. At
    year-end 70 percent of our estimated proved reserves were
    located in North America.



United
    States



OverviewWe have 9.7 million gross acres
    across the U.S., approximately half of which is undeveloped.
    Approximately 30 percent of the undeveloped acreage isheld-by-production.Our U.S. assets are located in the Gulf Coast, Permian and
    Central regions. The three regions provide our U.S. asset
    base with a balance of hydrocarbon mix and reserve life. In 2010
    48 percent of our U.S. production and 58 percent
    of our U.S. year-end reserves were oil and liquids. In
    addition, the reserve life of our U.S. regions ranged from
    nine to 30 years with the Gulf Coast region’s
    shorter-lived reserves balancing longer-lived reserves in the
    Central and Permian regions. In 2010 35 percent of
    Apache’s equivalent production and 44 percent of
    Apache’s total year-end reserves were in the U.S.



Gulf Coast RegionOur Gulf Coast assets are
    primarily located in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas
    on- and offshore Texas and Louisiana. In 2010 the Gulf Coast
    region contributed approximately 19 percent of our
    worldwide production and revenues, predominately from offshore
    properties. Apache’s Gulf Coast operations grew
    significantly during the year with the June acquisition of
    Devon’s Gulf of Mexico shelf properties and the addition of
    properties with the Mariner merger in November 2010. These
    transactions were aligned with our long-term core strategy of
    maintaining a balanced portfolio of assets. The region accounted
    for nearly 13 percent of our estimated proved reserves at
    year-end compared to 13 percent the previous year.



Apache has been the largest offshoreheld-by-productionacreage owner since 2004 and is now the largest producer in
    waters less than 500 feet deep (shelf). The Devon
    acquisition and Mariner merger brought significant development
    and exploration opportunities with high-quality assets
    complementary to our existing assets, as well as a strategic
    presence in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico (waters greater than
    500 feet deep). The deepwater Gulf of Mexico is relatively
    underexplored and oil prone and provides exposure to significant
    reserve and production





potential. Acreage increased 76 percent to 5.3 million gross
    acres: 2.5 million deepwater, 1.4 million shelf, and 1.4 million
    onshore. Over 50 percent of the region’s acreage was
    undeveloped.



In 2010 the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and
    Enforcement (BOEMRE) announced a series of moratoria, which
    directed oil and gas lessees and operators to cease drilling new
    deepwater (depths greater than 500 feet) wells on the Outer
    Continental Shelf (OCS), and put oil and gas lessees and
    operators on notice that, with certain exceptions, the BOEMRE
    would not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells and
    related activities. While the moratoria have been formally
    lifted, no new permits for deepwater drilling have been issued
    as of the date of this filing.



In addition, the BOEMRE issued new regulations in 2010 requiring
    additional information, documentation and analysis for all new
    wells on the OCS. The effect of these new regulations was to
    significantly slow down issuance of permits for shallow wells.
    Apache continues to operate under these new regulations and,
    through February 2011, has received 25 drilling permits for
    shallow wells. Current permitting activity has been slowed
    compared to prior-year levels, and the Company has budgeted its
    exploration and development activity accordingly.



Despite the curtailment of activity in the region stemming from
    new regulations, the region had a productive year, drilling or
    participating in 63 wells (36 in the Gulf of Mexico), up
    from 26 wells (20 in the Gulf of Mexico) in 2009, and
    performing 365 workovers and recompletions.



As a result of 2010 acquisitions and the differing growth and
    opportunity profiles, we have divided the assets into three
    regions beginning in 2011: Gulf of Mexico shelf, Gulf of Mexico
    deepwater and Gulf Coast onshore. In 2011 the Company plans to
    invest approximately $200 million, $1 billion and
    $500 million in the Gulf Coast onshore, Gulf of Mexico
    shelf and Gulf of Mexico deepwater assets, respectively, subject
    to receipt of permits from BOEMRE. The capital will be spent on
    drilling, recompletion and development projects, equipment
    upgrades, production enhancement projects, lease acquisition,
    seismic acquisition and abandonment activities.



On September 16, 2010, the BOEMRE and the Department of the
    Interior issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators (NTL) updating
    the procedures and timing for decommissioning offshore wells and
    platforms. While the so called “Idle Iron” NTL may
    result in an acceleration of timing to abandon certain wells and
    remove certain platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, our ongoing
    active well and equipment abandonment program mitigated the
    impact of the new regulations on Apache. The Company spent
    approximately $260 million to plug offshore wells and
    remove platforms in 2010. With the addition of the Devon and
    Mariner offshore properties, we currently plan to spend
    approximately $350 million in 2011.



Central RegionThe Central region includes
    nearly 2,000 wells and controls over one million gross
    acres primarily in western Oklahoma, the Texas panhandle and
    east Texas. Most of the region’s acreage isheld-by-production.Although the reserves and production are primarily natural gas,
    given the price disparity between oil and gas, the region
    successfully targeted oil and liquids rich gas plays in 2010.
    Oil-and liquids-production increased by 54 percent and
    90 percent, respectively, over the prior year. In 2010
    Apache drilled or participated in the drilling of 84 wells,
    99 percent of which were completed as producers. The region
    also performed 144 workovers and recompletions. The
    region’s year-end estimated proved reserves, which were
    90 percent natural gas, were six percent of Apache’s
    total.



In the Anadarko basin, the Granite Wash play has long been a
    core stacked-pay target for the region, where we have drilled
    many vertical wells over the past several decades. As a result,
    we control approximately 200,000 gross acres in this
    liquid-rich play, mostlyheld-by-production.Despite the numerous vertical wells drilled, the Granite Wash is
    re-emerging as a horizontal play that is capitalizing on
    advances in horizontal drilling and fracturing technology and
    high oil prices given the rich liquids yield of the wells. In
    2009 we drilled our first operated horizontal well in the
    Granite Wash. In 2010 we ramped up activity to 10 rigs, drilling
    31 horizontal Granite Wash wells and testing six additional
    horizons including the Hogshooter interval, which is shallower,
    younger and oilier than previously tested Granite Wash targets.
    We have completed two wells in the Hogshooter interval, which
    are separated by over fifteen miles of what appears to be very
    prolific acreage, primarily owned and operated by Apache. We
    have identified hundreds of additional Granite Wash horizontal
    well locations across our acreage. In 2011 we plan to keep a
    minimum of eight rigs running in this play and drill in excess
    of 40 horizontal wells, targeting several horizons.





We have had success on the Anadarko shelf drilling relatively
    shallow horizontal wells into the Cherokee formation. In 2010 we
    completed four horizontal wells in the Cherokee play with
    vertical depths of 6,500 feet and horizontal penetrations
    of nearly one mile. These wells had average30-dayrates
    of 520 b/d and 850 Mcf/d and an average Apache working
    interest of 78 percent.The wells are currently
    producing an average of 150 b/d and 560 Mcf/d. We plan to
    drill 13 horizontal wells in the Cherokee in 2011. In addition,
    we have had success with our program targeting oil in Ochiltree
    County, Texas. During the year we drilled four wells in the
    Cleveland formation at a vertical depth of 7,500 feet and
    participated in one horizontal well in the Marmaton formation at
    a depth of 11,000 feet. Two of the Cleveland wells and the
    Marmaton well commenced production in late 2010 at an average
    initial rate of approximately 500 b/d. Apache’s average
    working interest in the five wells is 90 percent. The two
    remaining Cleveland wells are awaiting completion, and we intend
    to keep at least one drilling rig running in the area throughout
    the year.



We are also employing horizontal drilling and multistage
    fracture technology in east Texas. In 2010 we drilled seven
    horizontal Bossier wells in Freestone County, Texas, where we
    own 45,000 gross acres. The wells produced an aggregate
    7.34 Bcf during the year and are currently producing37 MMcf/d,33 MMcf/dnet to Apache.



In 2011 the Central region plans to invest approximately
    $430 million in drilling, recompletions, equipment
    upgrades, production enhancement projects and lease
    acquisitions, primarily in the Anadarko basin. We currently plan
    to keep 12 rigs running all year, with more than 95 percent
    of the wells drilled horizontally and 89 percent of the
    wells drilled targeting oil or high liquid yield gas.



Permian RegionOur Permian region, carved out
    of our Central region, grew significantly in 2010. In July we
    opened a new regional office in Midland. The region’s
    property and acreage base increased substantially upon
    completion of the BP acquisition in July and the Mariner merger
    in November. These two transactions combined added approximately
    35 Mboe/d of new production and more than doubled our acreage to
    over three million gross acres with exposure to every known play
    in the Permian Basin. The drilling rig count has increased from
    five operating at the beginning of 2010 to more than 20 at the
    end of the year. The workover and completion rig count has
    increased from 56 to 80, and the employee headcount in Midland
    and the field has increased by more than 200 during this same
    time period. The region drilled or participated in
    263 wells and completed approximately 1,100 workovers and
    recompletions in 2010.



Apache is one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin,
    operating more than 11,000 wells in 152 fields, including
    45 waterfloods and six
    CO2floods. Fourth-quarter net production was 59 Mb/d and162 MMcf/dand included only six weeks of production from the properties
    acquired in the Mariner merger. The Permian region’s
    year-end estimated proved reserves, which were 76 percent
    oil and liquids, were 25 percent of Apache’s total.



During 2010 the Permian region tested horizontal drilling
    opportunities in four mature waterflood fields, the North
    McElroy, Shafter Lake, TXL South, and Dean Units, all of which
    resulted in commercial successes. The region ultimately drilled
    and completed a total of 17 horizontal wells in the units. The
    Midland team has developed a significant inventory of potential
    horizontal drilling applications on existing Apache acreage
    across the Permian Basin. In 2011 we plan to drill 41 horizontal
    wells across a number of the region’s assets.



In 2010 the region signed a20-yearCO2supply contract to develop approximately 8.4 MMboe of
    estimated proved reserves at Roberts Unit. Our 2010 drilling
    results at Roberts Unit include 15 production and
    CO2injection wells that resulted in higher than predicted
    production rates. The
    CO2development at Roberts Unit will continue during 2011 with 43
    new production and injection wells planned.



In 2011 the Permian Region plans to invest approximately
    $930 million in drilling, recompletion projects, equipment
    upgrades, expansion of existing facilities and equipment and
    leasing new acreage. We plan to keep more than 20 rigs running
    all year drilling an estimated 368 wells. The region’s
    2011 drilling activity will focus on a combination of Apache
    legacy assets and the newly acquired Mariner and BP properties.
    On the BP properties alone, the region has identified more than
    2,000 drilling locations. Current plans include 130 wells
    in the Deadwood area (acquired from Mariner) where we hold
    63,000 net acres subject to continuous drilling clauses and
    in the Empire Yeso area (acquired from BP), where we plan to
    drill approximately 55 wells.



U.S. MarketingIn general, most of our
    U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices.
    Our natural gas is sold primarily to Local Distribution
    Companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users and integrated major oil
    companies.





Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated
    major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies and
    refiners. The objective is to maximize the value of crude oil
    sold by identifying the best markets and most economical
    transportation routes available to move the product. Sales
    contracts are generally30-dayevergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by
    either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced
    daily at prevailing market prices.



Canada



OverviewApache has 6.3 million net acres
    across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and
    Saskatchewan, including approximately 1.3 million net
    mineral and leasehold acres in Western Alberta and British
    Columbia acquired from BP in 2010. Our acreage base provides a
    significant inventory of both low-risk development drilling
    opportunities in and around a number of Apache fields and
    higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities. At
    year-end 2010 our Canadian region held approximately
    26 percent of our estimated proved reserves. In 2010 we
    drilled or participated in 182 wells in Canada, eight of
    which were exploratory wells. The region’s 2010 natural gas
    production increased ten percent, while liquids production was
    one percent higher.



On our conventional assets, we are focused on oil projects
    located primarily in Alberta and Saskatchewan, enabling us to
    take advantage of the current strong oil prices. We will utilize
    our drilling technology and reservoir modeling expertise to
    identify and exploit unswept oil in our waterflood projects in
    the House Mountain, Leduc and Snipe Lake fields. Additional
    drilling for oil will continue on our enhanced oil recovery
    projects in Midale and Provost with long-term plans to develop
    and expand waterfloods and
    CO2projects. We will also continue intermediate-depth gas
    development drilling in Kaybob and West 5 areas.



Apache’s near-term natural gas production growth will
    likely be driven by our activity in two large growth plays in
    British Colombia: shale gas in the Horn River basin and tight
    sands in the Noel area. In the Horn River basin, Apache has a
    50-percent interest and 210,000 net acres. During 2010
    Apache reached a peak of100 MMcf/dnet, drilled 29 new wells and completed 30 wells. In 2011
    we plan to drill 10 and complete 28 wells in the Horn River
    basin. Apache acquired its 100-percent working interest in the
    Noel area from BP in October 2010. Gas production from Noel
    reached an exit rate of100 MMcf/din December 2010. In 2011 we are currently planning a horizontal
    drilling program of approximately 11 wells in the Noel
    Area. Apache has identified many years of drilling activity in
    both plays.



During the first quarter of 2010 Apache Canada Ltd. (Apache
    Canada), through its subsidiaries, purchased a 51 percent
    interest in a planned LNG export terminal (Kitimat LNG facility)
    and a 25.5-percent interest in a partnership that owns a related
    proposed pipeline. In the second quarter of 2010 EOG Resources
    Canada, Inc. (EOG Canada), through its wholly-owned
    subsidiaries, acquired the remaining 49 percent of the
    Kitimat LNG facility and a 24.5-percent interest in the pipeline
    partnership. In February 2011 Apache Canada and EOG Canada
    entered into an agreement to purchase the remaining 50-percent
    interest in the pipeline partnership from Pacific Northern Gas
    Ltd. (PNG). Under the terms of the agreement, PNG will operate
    and maintain the planned pipeline under a seven-year agreement
    with Apache Canada and EOG Canada with provisions for five-year
    renewals. It also includes a20-yeartransportation service arrangement which may require Apache
    Canada and EOG Canada, under certain circumstances, to use a
    portion of PNG’s current pipeline capacity. Upon close of
    the transaction, expected in the second quarter of 2011, Apache
    Canada and EOG Canada will own 51 percent and
    49 percent, respectively, of the pipeline partnership and
    proposed pipeline.



Apache Canada and EOG Canada plan to build the Kitimat LNG
    facility on Bish Cove near the Port of Kitimat, 400 miles
    north of Vancouver, British Columbia. The facility is planned
    for an initial minimum capacity of700 MMcf/d,or five million metric tons of LNG per year, of which Apache
    Canada has reserved 51 percent. The proposed287-milepipeline will originate in Summit Lake, British Columbia, and is
    designed to link the Kitimat LNG facility to the pipeline system
    currently servicing western Canada’s natural gas producing
    regions. Apache Canada will have rights to 51-percent of the
    capacity in the proposed pipeline. Completion of the front-end
    engineering and design (FEED) study and a final investment
    decision are targeted for late 2011. Construction is expected to
    commence in 2012, with commercial operations projected to begin
    in 2015.



Our plans for 2011 are to drill or participate in a total of
    149 wells in Canada, including 129 development wells and 20
    exploratory wells. The planned development includes nine drills
    and 28 completions in the Horn River basin.





During 2011 the region plans to invest approximately
    $800 million for drilling and development projects,
    equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects and seismic
    acquisition. Approximately $25 million is allocated for
    Gathering, Transmission and Processing (GTP) assets.



MarketingOur Canadian natural gas marketing
    activities focus on sales to LDCs, utilities, end-users,
    integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators and
    marketers. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is
    intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk in our
    portfolio. To diversify our market exposure, we transport
    natural gas via our firm transportation contracts to California,
    the Chicago area and eastern Canada. We sell the majority of our
    Canadian gas on a monthly basis at eitherfirst-of-the-monthor daily prices. In 2010 approximately two percent of our gas
    sales were subject to long-term fixed-price contracts, with the
    latest expiration in 2011.



Our Canadian crude is sold primarily to integrated major oil
    companies and marketers. We sell our oil based on West Texas
    Intermediate (WTI) and sell our NGLs based on postings or a
    percentage of WTI. Prices are adjusted for quality,
    transportation and a market-reflective negotiated differential.
    We maximize the value of our condensate and heavier crudes by
    determining whether to blend the condensate into our own crude
    production or sell it in the market as a segregated product. We
    transport crude oil on 12 pipelines to the major trading hubs
    within Alberta and Saskatchewan, which enables us to achieve a
    higher netback for the production and to diversify our
    purchasers.



International



Apache’s international assets are located in Egypt,
    Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North Sea, Argentina and
    Chile. In 2010 international assets contributed 52 percent
    of our production and 56 percent of our oil and gas
    production revenues. At year-end 30 percent of our
    estimated proved reserves were located outside North America.



Egypt



OverviewOur commitment to Egypt began in 1994
    with our first Qarun discovery well. Today we control
    11.3 million gross acres making Apache the largest acreage
    holder in Egypt’s Western Desert. Only 15 percent of
    our gross acreage in Egypt has been developed. That
    15 percent produced an average of 189 Mb/d and799 MMcf/din 2010, 99 Mb/d and375 MMcf/dnet to Apache, which we believe makes Apache the largest
    producer of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western
    Desert and the third largest in all of Egypt. The remaining
    85 percent of our acreage is undeveloped, providing us with
    considerable exploration and development opportunities for the
    future. We have3-Dseismic
    covering over 12,000 square miles, or 68 percent of
    our acreage. In 2010 the region contributed 28 percent of
    our production revenue, 24 percent of our production and
    10 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves. Our
    estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the
    economic interest method and exclude the host country share
    reserves.



Our operations in Egypt are conducted pursuant to
    production-sharing agreements, in 24 separate concessions, under
    which the contractor partner pays all operating and capital
    expenditure costs for exploration and development. A percentage
    of the production, usually up to 40 percent, is available
    to the contractor partners to recover operating and capital
    expenditure costs, with the balance generally allocated between
    the contractor partners and Egyptian General Petroleum
    Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually-defined basis. In 2010,
    Apache retained approximately 52 percent and
    47 percent, respectively, of the gross oil and gas produced
    from our Egyptian concessions. Development leases within
    concessions generally have a25-yearlife, with extensions possible for additional commercial
    discoveries or on a negotiated basis, and currently have
    expiration dates ranging from 10 to 25 years.



Apache’s Egyptian operations had another year of growth in
    2010: gross daily production increased 16 percent, and net
    daily production increased six percent. We maintained an active
    drilling and development program, drilling 204 wells,
    including 10 new field discoveries, and conducted 662 workovers
    and recompletions. In addition, we achieved a goal we set in
    2005 to double gross equivalent production from our operated
    concessions by the end of 2010. In November we closed on the
    purchase of BP assets in Egypt’s Western Desert, acquiring
    four development leases and one exploration concession as well
    as strategically-positioned infrastructure that will enable
    Apache to increase production from existing fields in the
    Western Desert.





During 2011 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.1 billion for drilling, recompletion projects,
    development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement
    projects and seismic acquisition. Our drilling program includes
    a combination of development and exploration wells with current
    plans to drill 65 gross exploration wells, 50 percent
    more than 2010. We will also drill our first horizontal well in
    the Western Desert.



Egypt political unrestAs a result of
    political unrest, protests, riots, street demonstrations and
    acts of civil disobedience in the Egyptian capital of Cairo that
    began on January 25, 2011, Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak
    stepped down, effective February 11, 2011. The Egyptian
    Supreme Council of the Armed Forces is now in power. On
    February 13, 2011, the Council announced that the
    constitution would be suspended, both houses of parliament would
    be dissolved, and that the military would rule for six months
    until elections can be held. Following the advice of the
    U.S. State Department, Apache initially evacuated all
    non-essential personnel from Egypt. As conditions stabilized
    recently, approximately one-third of the evacuated employees
    returned. Apache’s production, located in remote locations
    in the Western Desert, has continued uninterrupted; however,
    further changes in the political, economic and social conditions
    or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as
    changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions,
    expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization,and/orforced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts
    with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business,
    financial condition and results of operations.



Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the
    Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and highly rated
    international insurers covering its investments in Egypt. In the
    aggregate, these policies, subject to the policy terms and
    conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to
    Apache covering losses arising from confiscation,
    nationalization, and expropriation risks and currency
    inconvertibility. In addition, the Company has a separate policy
    with OPIC, which provides $300 million of coverage for
    losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral
    awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and
    (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when actions
    taken by the Government of Egypt prevent Apache form exporting
    our share of production.



MarketingOur gas production is sold to EGPC
    primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale
    based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu
    and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, which corresponds to a Dated
    Brent price of $21.00 per barrel. Generally, this
    industry-pricing formula applies to all new gas discovered and
    produced. In exchange for extension of the Khalda Concession
    lease in July 2004, Apache agreed to accept the industry-pricing
    formula on a majority of gas sold, but retained the previous
    gas-price formula (without a price cap) until 2013 for up to100 MMcf/dgross. This region averaged $3.62 per Mcf in 2010.



Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession and other
    nearby Western Desert blocks is sold primarily to third parties
    in the Mediterranean market or to EGPC when called upon to
    supply domestic demand. Oil sales are made either directly into
    the Egyptian oil pipeline grid, sold to non-governmental third
    parties including those supplying the Middle East Oil Refinery
    located in northern Egypt, or exported from or sold at one of
    two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production
    that is presently sold to EGPC is sold on a spot basis priced at
    Brent with a monthly EGPC official differential applied. In 2010
    we sold 32 cargoes (approximately 10.1 MMbbls) of Western
    Desert crude oil into the export market from the El Hamra
    terminal located on the northern coast of Egypt. These export
    cargoes were sold to third parties at market prices above our
    domestic prices received from EGPC. Additionally, Apache sold
    Qarun oil (approximately 10.7 MMbbls) at the Sidi Kerir
    terminal, also located on the northern coast of Egypt. This
    Qarun oil was sold at prevailing market prices into the domestic
    market to non-governmental purchasers (1.3 MMbbls) or
    exported primarily to refiners in the Mediterranean region (15
    cargoes for approximately 9.4 MMbbls).



Australia



OverviewApache’s holdings in Australia
    are focused offshore Western Australia in the Carnarvon basin,
    where we have operated since acquiring the gas processing
    facilities on Varanus Island and adjacent producing properties
    in 1993, the Exmouth basin and the Browse basin. We also have
    exploration acreage in the Gippsland basin offshore southeastern
    Australia. Production operations are concentrated in the
    Carnarvon and Exmouth basins. In total, we control approximately
    12.2 million gross acres in Australia through 35
    exploration permits, 14





production licenses and six retention leases. In addition, we
    have one production license and four retention leases pending
    confirmation.



During the year the region participated in drilling
    31 wells, of which 23 were productive. In addition, we
    expanded our exploration opportunities in the Carnarvon and
    Exmouth basins via farm-ins to seven permits. The transactions
    resulted in a 58-percent increase in our net undeveloped acreage
    in the Carnarvon basin and added 1.9 million net acres for
    exploration in the Exmouth basin. Oil production increased by
    369 percent on initial production from the development of
    our 2007 Van Gogh and Pyrenees oil field discoveries, while gas
    production increased by nine percent. Production from Australia
    accounted for approximately 12 percent of our total 2010
    production, and year-end estimated proved reserves were
    11 percent of Apache’s total.



The region has a pipeline of projects that are expected to
    contribute to production growth as they are brought on-stream
    over coming years.



In 2011, development of our Reindeer field discovery should be
    complete with first production expected late in the year upon
    completion of our Devil Creek Gas Plant. The plant will be
    Western Australia’s third domestic natural gas processing
    hub and the first new one in more than 15 years. The
    two-train plant is designed to process 200 million cubic
    feet of gas per day from the Apache-operated Reindeer field. In
    2009, we entered into a gas sales contract covering a portion of
    the field’s future production. Under the contract, Apache
    and its joint venture partner agreed to supply 154 Bcf of
    gas over seven years (approximately60 MMcf/dbeginning in the fourth quarter of 2011) at prices
    substantially higher than we have historically received in
    Western Australia. Apache owns a 55-percent interest in the
    field. Also in 2011, initial production is projected from the
    Halyard-1 discovery well which is a subsea completion tied back
    to the existing gas facilities on Varanus Island.



In 2012, the 2010 Spar-2 discovery is projected to commence
    production through an extension of the Halyard sub sea
    infrastructure which will also allow for the tie-in of future
    wells.



In 2013, first production is projected from four gas wells
    completed in 2010 in the Macedon gas field. We have a
    28 percent non-operating working interest in the field. Gas
    will be delivered via a60-milepipeline to a200 MMcf/dgas plant to be built at Ashburton North in Western Australia.
    The project, approved in 2010, is currently underway; with first
    production projected in 2013.



Also in 2013 first production is projected from the Coniston oil
    field which lies just north of the Van Gogh field. The project
    was sanctioned for development in 2010. Current plans call for
    the field to be produced from subsea completions tied back to
    the Van Gogh field floating, production, storage and offloading
    (FPSO) Ningaloo Vision.



In 2014 first production from the Balnaves field is projected,
    should the project proceed past Final Investment Decision (FID)
    stage. The Balnaves field is an oil accumulation in the Brunello
    gas field, where Apache drilled three successful development
    wells which we plan to produce through a FPSO. The project is
    currently in the Front End FEED stage with FID currently
    projected for the second half of 2011.



In 2016 we are projecting to begin production from our operated
    Julimar and Brunello field gas discoveries through the Chevron
    operated Wheatstone LNG hub, in which we own a foundation equity
    partner interest of 13 percent. Apache’s projected net
    gas sales from the fields are160 MMcf/dand 3,250 b/d with a projected15-yearproduction plateau when the multi-year project is fully
    operational. The project, which is currently in FEED, will
    convert the gas into LNG for sale on the world market. World LNG
    prices are typically oil-linked prices and are currently higher
    than the historical gas prices in Western Australia. The project
    FID is scheduled for 2011, with first LNG projected in 2016.



During 2011 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.2 billion for drilling, recompletion projects,
    development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement
    projects and seismic acquisition. Approximately half of the 2011
    investment will be for development and processing facilities in
    connection with the projects discussed above.



MarketingWestern Australia has historically
    had a local market for natural gas with a limited number of
    buyers and sellers resulting in sales under mostly long-term,
    fixed-price contracts, many of which contain periodic price
    escalation clauses based on either the Australian consumer price
    index or a commodity linkage. As of





December 31, 2010, Apache had a total of 18 active gas
    contracts in Australia with expiration dates ranging from
    November 2012 to July 2030. Recent increases in demand and
    higher development costs have increased the supply prices
    required from the local market in order to support the
    development of new supplies. As a result, market prices received
    on recent contracts, including our Reindeer field, are
    substantially higher than historical levels.



We anticipate selling LNG from our Julimar and Brunello field
    gas discoveries at prices tied to oil and sold into
    international markets.



We directly market all of our Australian crude oil production
    into Australian domestic and international markets at prices
    generally indexed to Dated Brent benchmark crude oil prices plus
    a premium, which are typically above NYMEX oil prices.



North
    Sea



OverviewApache entered the North Sea in 2003
    after acquiring an approximate 97-percent working interest in
    the Forties field (Forties). In 2010 the North Sea region
    produced 20.9 MMboe (99 percent oil), approximately
    nine percent of our total worldwide production and
    13 percent of Apache’s oil and gas production
    revenues. During 2010 production from Forties decreased seven
    percent compared to 2009 as natural well decline and unplanned
    maintenance downtime exceeded gains from drilling. At year-end
    2010, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of
    155 MMbbls of crude oil in this region, approximately five
    percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves. Apache
    acquired Forties with 45 producing wells. Today, there are 77
    producing wells with an inventory of future locations. By the
    end of the first quarter of 2010, Apache had produced and sold,
    net to its interest, oil volumes in excess of the proved
    reserves booked when we acquired this interest in 2003.



During the summer of 2010 a new3-Dseismic
    survey was acquired in Forties. Comparison of this data with3-Dseismic
    shot in prior years has highlighted many areas of bypassed oil
    in the reservoir and provided better definition of existing
    targets. In 2010, 20 wells were drilled into the Forties
    reservoir, of which 12 were productive. We project that this
    Forties success rate of 60 percent will increase in the
    future, as drilling results from late December 2010 and early
    January 2011 have validated the new4-Devaluation and geological interpretation. We also drilled three
    exploration wells and one development well outside Forties. The
    development well and one of the exploration wells were
    successful.



In 2011 the region will invest approximately $850 million
    on a diverse set of capital projects. Forties will see another
    year of active drilling with two platform rigs and ajack-upin
    operation. Construction of the Forties Alpha Satellite Platform
    is underway and is projected to be complete by mid-year 2012.
    This platform will sit adjacent to the main Alpha Platform and
    provide an additional 18 drilling slots along with power
    generation, fluid separation, gas lift compression and oil
    export pumping. Also, during the third quarter of 2011 drilling
    will commence on the Bacchus field, Apache’s first North
    Sea subsea field development. First production is projected by
    year-end of 2011. The region also expects to participate in at
    least two exploration wells outside Forties.



In January 2011 a subsea pipeline connecting our Forties Bravo
    platform to our Charlie platform was shut-in because of
    corrosion. A project is underway to re-route the production
    through a smaller line until a new flexible pipeline is
    installed. This intermediate solution should be completed by the
    first of March 2011 and will allow us to produce approximately
    half of the 11,600 b/d that flowed through the main
    pipeline. The new main subsea pipeline will be completed by
    September 2011.



MarketingIn 2010 we sold our Forties crude
    under both term contracts (70 percent) and spot cargoes
    (30 percent). The term sales are composed of a market-based
    index plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for
    term arrangements. The prices received for spot cargoes are
    market driven and can trade at a premium or discount to the
    market based index.



All 2011 production will be sold under a term contract with aper-barrelpremium to the Dated Brent index. A separate physical sales
    contract within the term sale for 20,000 b/d was entered into
    with a floor price of $70.00 per barrel and an average ceiling
    price of $98.56 per barrel. This contract will be settled
    against Dated Brent.





Argentina



OverviewWe have had a continuous presence in
    Argentina since 2001, which was expanded substantially by two
    acquisitions in 2006. We currently have operations in the
    Provinces of Neuquén, Rio Negro, Tierra del Fuego and
    Mendoza. We have interests in 24 concessions, exploration
    permits and other interests totaling over 3.4 million gross
    acres (2.9 million net). Apache now holds oil and gas
    assets in three of the main Argentine hydrocarbon basins:
    Neuquén, Austral and Cuyo. Our concessions have varying
    expiration dates ranging from four years to over fifteen years
    remaining, subject to potential additional extensions. In 2010
    Argentina produced seven percent of our worldwide production and
    held four percent of our estimated proved reserves at year-end.



In 2010 the region had its most successful development drilling
    program in its history, drilling 56 gross wells:; 43 in the
    Neuquén basin and 13 in the Austral basin of Tierra del
    Fuego. Drilling focused on shallow development targets,
    93 percent of the wells were successful. In addition, the
    region completed 106 capital projects consisting of
    recompletions, increasing lifting capacity, and facility
    projects.



Also during 2010 Apache acquired approximately 567 square
    kilometers of3-Dseismic
    on two blocks located in the Cuyo basin. Apache employed new
    cable-less technology intended to minimize environmental impact
    in the area, the first time this technology has been used in
    Argentina. We are currently analyzing the results from the
    seismic shoot and expect to commence a drilling campaign in the
    Cuyo basin in the first quarter of 2011.



In 2011 we will begin negotiations for extensions of three
    concessions each in the Tierra del Fuego and Rio Negro
    Provinces, which are scheduled to expire in 2016 and 2017.
    Future investment by Apache in the Tierra del Fuego Province
    will be significantly influenced by the probability of obtaining
    the Province’s agreement to an extension of the present
    concession expirations. In March 2009 Apache reached an
    agreement with the Province of Neuquén to extend eight
    federal oil and gas concessions for 10 additional years. The
    concessions, which were scheduled to expire between 2015 and
    2017, encompass approximately 590,000 net acres, including
    exploratory areas totaling 514,000 net acres. Neuquén
    operations generate about half of Apache’s total output in
    Argentina.



During 2011 the region plans to invest approximately
    $300 million for drilling, recompletion projects,
    development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement
    projects, and seismic acquisition.



Marketing



Natural GasApache sells its natural gas
    through three avenues:



•Gas Plus program: This program was instituted by the Argentine
    government to encourage new gas supplies through the development
    of tight sands and unconventional reserves. Under this program,
    qualifying projects are allowed to sell gas at prices that are
    above the regulated rates. During 2010 Apache signed three Gas
    Plus contracts totaling63 MMcf/dof gross production from fields in the Neuquén and Rio
    Negro Provinces. The first contract, for10 MMcf/dat $4.10 per MMBtu for 2010, has been extended through 2011 for11 MMcf/dat the $4.10 per MMBtu. The other two contracts, which together
    totaled53 MMcf/dat $5.00 per MMBtu, are expected to commence in the first
    quarter of 2011. The gas supply is required to come from wells
    drilled in the projects’ approved fields and formations. We
    believe this program, reflects changing market conditions, which
    point to improving markets and price realizations going forward.•Government-regulated pricing: The volumes we are required to
    sell at regulated prices are set by the government and vary with
    seasonal factors and industry category. During 2010 we realized
    an average price of $1.20 per Mcf on government-regulated sales.•Unregulated market: The majority of our remaining volumes are
    sold into the unregulated market. In 2010 realizations averaged
    $2.65 per Mcf.



Crude OilOur crude oil is subject to an
    export tax, which effectively limits the prices buyers are
    willing to pay for domestic sales. Domestic oil prices are
    currently based on $42 per barrel, plus quality adjustments and
    local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or
    decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra
    del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist; however, Apache
    retains the value-added tax collected from buyers, effectively
    increasing realized prices by 21 percent. As a result, 2010
    oil prices realized from Tierra del





Fuego oil production averaged $65.03 per barrel as compared to
    our Neuquén basin production, which averaged $53.68 per
    barrel.



Chile



In November 2007 Apache was awarded exploration rights on two
    blocks comprising approximately one million net acres on the
    Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego. This acreage is adjacent to
    our 552,000 net acres on the Argentine side of the island
    of Tierra del Fuego and represents a natural extension of our
    expanding exploration and production operations. The Lenga and
    Rusfin Blocks were ratified by the Chilean government on
    July 24, 2008. In January 2009 a3-Dseismic
    survey totaling 1,000 square kilometers was completed, and
    in November 2009 the first of a three-well exploration program
    commenced drilling. The three wells have now been drilled, and
    we are currently evaluating results.



Major
    Customers



In 2010 purchases by Shell accounted for 15 percent of the
    Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues.



Drilling
    Statistics



Worldwide in 2010 we participated in drilling 904 gross
    wells, with 826 (91 percent) completed as producers. We
    also performed nearly 2,500 workovers and recompletions during
    the year. Historically, our drilling activities in the
    U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and
    extension of existing, producing fields rather than exploration.
    As a general matter, our operations outside of the
    U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and exploitation wells.
    In addition to our completed wells, at year-end several wells
    had not yet reached completion: 51 in the U.S. (25.04 net);
    7 in Canada (6.18 net); 22 in Egypt (20 net); 2 in Australia
    (0.64 net); 3 in the North Sea (2.91 net); and 7 in Argentina
    (5.15 net).

As of December 31, 2010, we had 3,284,814, 1,588,390, and
    3,552,045 net acres scheduled to expire by
    December 31, 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively, if
    production is not established or we take no other action to
    extend the terms. We plan to continue the terms of many of these
    licenses and concession areas through operational or
    administrative actions and do not project a significant portion
    of our net acreage position to expire before such actions occur.



As of December 31, 2010, 30 percent of U.S. net
    undeveloped acreage and 36 percent of Canadian undeveloped
    acreage was held by production.



Estimated
    Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows



Effective December 31, 2009, Apache adopted revised oil and
    gas disclosure requirements set forth by the SEC in ReleaseNo. 33-8995,“Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” and as
    codified by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in
    Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 932,
    “Extractive Industries — Oil and Gas.” The
    new rules include changes to the pricing used to estimate
    reserves, the option to disclose probable and possible reserves,
    revised definitions for proved reserves, additional disclosures
    with respect to undeveloped reserves, and other new or revised
    definitions and disclosures.





PUD reserves include those reserves that are expected to be
    recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
    wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for
    recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved
    reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development
    areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or
    where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of
    economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as
    having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been
    adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within
    five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time
    period.





The following table shows proved oil, NGL and gas reserves as of
    December 31, 2010, based on average commodity prices in
    effect on the first day of each month in 2010, held flat for the
    life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales
    are covered by physical contract terms. The table shows reserves
    on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an
    equivalent barrel of oil based on a 6:1 energy equivalent ratio.
    This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between
    the two products.

As of December 31, 2010, Apache had total estimated proved
    reserves of 1,309 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs
    and 9.9 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated
    proved reserves are the energy equivalent of 3.0 billion
    barrels of oil or 17.7 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil
    represents 39 percent. As of December 31, 2010, the
    Company’s proved developed reserves totaled
    1,985 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled
    968 MMboe, or approximately 33 percent of worldwide
    total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose
    probable or possible reserves in this filing.



The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved
    developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves as of
    December 31, 2010, 2009, 2008 and 2007, changes in
    estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and
    estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are
    contained in Note 12 — Supplemental Oil and Gas
    Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of thisForm 10-K.Estimated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2010,
    were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per
    annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average
    of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in
    2010 and 2009, held flat for the life of the production, except
    where prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Future net
    cash flows as of December 31, 2008, were estimated using
    commodity prices in effect at the end of that year, in
    accordance with the SEC guidelines in effect prior to the
    issuance of the Modernization Rules.



Proved
    Undeveloped Reserves



The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of
    968 MMboe as of December 31, 2010, increased by
    237 MMboe over the 731 MMboe of PUD reserves estimated
    at the end of 2009. This increase was, in part, due to our 2010
    acquisitions described above. During the year, Apache converted
    64 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves
    through development drilling activity. In North America we
    converted 31 MMboe, with the remaining 33 MMboe in our
    international areas.



During the year a total of approximately $1.1 billion was
    spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as
    PUD reserves at the end of 2009. A portion of  our costs
    incurred each year relate to development projects that will be
    converted to proved developed reserves in future years. We spent
    $517 million on PUD reserve development activity in North
    America and $574 million in the international areas. At
    year-end 2010, no material amounts of PUD reserves remain
    undeveloped for five years or more after they were initially
    disclosed as PUD reserves.





Preparation
    of Oil and Gas Reserve Information



Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are reasonably
    certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to
    revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and
    revised either upward or downward, as warranted.



Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
    level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
    of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the
    operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
    geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas
    and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
    necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
    revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is
    compiled in a computer database application, to which only
    authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent
    with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed
    internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s
    Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis.
    Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our centralized
    and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating
    expenses, netback prices, production trends and development
    timing are reasonable.



Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir
    Engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing
    the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for
    coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party
    engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in
    Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of industry
    experience with positions of increasing responsibility within
    Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The
    Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering
    reports directly to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.



Form 10-K



During 2010, 2009, and 2008, Ryder Scott’s review covered
    72, 79 and 82 percent of the Company’s worldwide
    estimated proved reserves value and 63, 69, and 73 percent
    of the Company’s total proved reserves, respectively. Ryder
    Scott’s review of 2010 covered 59 percent of U.S.,
    42 percent of Canada, 64 percent of Argentina,
    99 percent of Australia, 83 percent of Egypt and
    83 percent of the United Kingdom’s total proved
    reserves. Ryder Scott’s review of 2009 covered
    66 percent of U.S., 48 percent of Canada,
    63 percent of Argentina, 96 percent of Australia,
    86 percent of Egypt and 80 percent of the United
    Kingdom’s total proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s review
    of 2008 covered 70 percent of U.S., 51 percent of
    Canada, 58 percent of Argentina, 100 percent of
    Australia, 87 percent of Egypt and 89 percent of the
    United Kingdom’s total proved reserves. We have filed Ryder
    Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to thisForm 10-K.



According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review,
    including the data, technical processes and interpretations
    presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies
    utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply
    with the current SEC regulations and the overall proved reserves
    for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in
    aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance
    guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers
    auditing standards.

Title
    to Interests



As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title
    records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate
    professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire
    properties. We believe that our title to all of the various
    interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with
    the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry,
    subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract
    substantially from the value of the interests or materially
    interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned
    by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty,
    or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to
    such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may
    additionally be subject to obligations or duties under
    applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
    arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests
    may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net
    profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and
    current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases,
    and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of
    which detract substantially from the value of the interests or
    materially interfere with their use in our operations.



Additional
    Information about Apache



In this section, references to “we,” “us,”
    “our,” and “Apache” include Apache
    Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise
    specifically stated.



Remediation
    Plans and Procedures



Apache adopted a Region Spill Response Plan (the Plan) for its
    Gulf of Mexico operations to ensure a rapid and effective
    response to spill events that may occur on Apache-operated
    properties. Periodically, drills are conducted to measure and
    maintain the effectiveness of the Plan. These drills include the
    participation of spill response contractors, representatives of
    the Clean Gulf Associates (CGA, described below), and
    representatives of governmental agencies. The primary
    association available to Apache in the event of a spill is CGA.
    Apache has received approval for the Plan from the BOEMRE.
    Apache personnel review the Plan annually and update where
    necessary.



Apache is a member of, and has an employee representative on the
    executive committee of, CGA, anot-for-profitassociation of producing and pipeline companies operating in the
    Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of
    effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate
    spill response for its member companies’ operations in the
    Gulf of Mexico. To this end, CGA has bareboat chartered (an
    arrangement for the hiring of a boat with no crew or provisions
    included) its marine equipment to the Marine Spill Response
    Corporation (MSRC), a national, private,not-for-profitmarine spill response organization, which is funded by grants
    from the Marine Preservation Association. MSRC maintains
    CGA’s equipment (currently including 13 shallow water
    skimmers, four fast response vessels with skimming capabilities,
    nine fast response containment-skimming units, a large skimming
    containment barge, numerous containment systems, wildlife
    cleaning and rehabilitation facilities and dispersant inventory)
    at various staging points around the Gulf of Mexico in its ready
    state, and in the event of a spill, MSRC stands ready to
    mobilize all of this equipment to CGA members. MSRC also handles
    the maintenance and mobilization of CGA non-marine equipment. In
    addition, CGA maintains a contract





with Airborne Support Inc., which provides aircraft and
    dispersant capabilities for CGA member companies. In 2010 we
    paid CGA approximately $312,000: $12,800 per capita and a fee
    based on annual production.



time-to-time



Apache participates in a number of industry-wide task forces
    that are studying ways to better access and control blowouts in
    subsea environments and increase containment and recovery
    methods. Two such task forces are the Subsea Well Control and
    Containment Task Force and the Offshore Operating Procedures
    Task Force. In 2011, Apache’s wholly-owned subsidiary
    Apache Deepwater LLC, retained the Helix Energy Solution Group
    in conjunction with its CGA membership, and will become a member
    of the Marine Well Containment Company to fulfill the government
    permit requirements for containment and oil spill response plans
    in Deepwater operations.



Competitive
    Conditions



The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the
    exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of
    oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and
    produce reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil, gas
    and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil
    companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other
    independent oil and gas companies and participants in other
    industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial
    and individual consumers.



Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other
    resources substantially larger than we possess or have
    established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong
    governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new
    entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage
    in bidding for leases or drilling rights.



However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets,
    which comprises large acreage positions and well-established
    production bases across six countries, and our balanced
    production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive
    systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong
    competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do
    not possess similar political, geographic and production
    diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of
    geologic and geographic opportunities in the six countries in
    which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate
    capital investments in response to changes in local business
    environments and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will
    be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.





Environmental
    Compliance



As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we
    are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, local and
    foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of
    materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws
    and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the
    lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollutionclean-upresulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for
    pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of
    operations in affected areas. Although environmental
    requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry,
    as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us
    differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our
    industry.



We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our
    efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are
    necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have
    established policies for continuing compliance with
    environmental laws and regulations, including regulations
    applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do
    business. We have established operating procedures and training
    programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field
    facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws
    and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and
    procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating
    expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to
    environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses
    related to training and compliance with regulations and laws
    that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of
    materials into the environment will have a material impact on
    our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In
    November 2010 Apache entered into an agreed order with the Texas
    Commission on Environmental Quality and paid a total of $111,000
    in administrative penalties to settle allegations regarding
    operations of two natural gas processing plants.



Changes to existing, or additions of, laws, regulations,
    enforcement policies or requirements in one or more of the
    countries or regions in which we operate could require us to
    make additional capital expenditures. While the events in the
    U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010 have resulted in the enactment
    of, and may result in the enactment of additional, laws or
    requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the
    environment, we do not believe that any such regulations or laws
    enacted or adopted as of this date will have a material adverse
    impact on our cost of operations, earnings or competitive
    position.
