Growth Strategy

Apache’s
mission is to grow a profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, which are centered on
the following core strategic components:



•diverse portfolio of core assets



•conservative capital structure



•rate of return focus







Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have underpinned our ability to deliver
long-term production and reserve growth and achieve competitive returns on invested capital for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased reserves 23 out of the last 28 years and production 32 out of the past 35 years, a testament to our
consistency over the long-term.

Apache pursues growth opportunities through exploration and development drilling, supplemented by
occasional strategic acquisitions and portfolio highgrading through asset divestitures. At the end of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, Apache undertook a strategic review of our portfolio with the ultimate goal of keeping the right mix of assets that
generate strong returns and excess cash flow and drive more predictable production growth to create shareholder value. In May 2013, Apache announced that it would divest approximately $4 billion in assets and use the proceeds to pay down debt and
repurchase Apache common shares. Apache surpassed these goals, divesting approximately $7 billion of assets, paying down $2.6 billion in debt, and repurchasing $1 billion in Apache common shares during 2013. Significant transactions since announcing
our strategic repositioning initiatives include:



•Argentina DivestitureOn February 12, 2014, Apache subsidiaries announced an agreement to sell all of its operations in Argentina to YPF Sociedad Anónima (YPF) for cash consideration of $800 million
plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.



•Egypt Sinopec PartnershipOn November 14, 2013, Apache announced the completion of the sale of a one-third minority participation in its Egypt oil and gas business to a subsidiary of Sinopec International
Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec). Apache received cash consideration of $2.95 billion. This noncontrolling interest is recorded separately in the Company’s financial statements.



•Gulf of Mexico Shelf DivestitureOn September 30, 2013, Apache completed the sale of its Gulf of Mexico Shelf operations and properties to Fieldwood Energy LLC (Fieldwood), an affiliate of Riverstone
Holdings. Under the terms of the agreement, Apache received cash consideration of $3.7 billion, and Fieldwood assumed $1.5 billion of discounted asset abandonment liabilities. Additionally, Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in
both exploration blocks and in horizons below production in developed blocks, and access to existing infrastructure.



•Canadian DivestituresIn the third and fourth quarters of 2013, Apache completed three separate divestitures of oil and gas producing properties in Canada for total cash consideration of $326 million before
customary post-closing adjustments.

Our growth portfolio going forward will be centered on (i) increasing onshore
North American liquids production that provides for more predictable and attractive rates of return, (ii) generating excess cash flow from our international operations, and (iii) continuing longer-term growth initiatives, which include our
Wheatstone and Kitimat LNG projects. In 2013, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our transition towards North American Onshore liquids growth, with all four of our onshore North American regions increasing liquids production and by replacing more
than our worldwide production through our exploration and development activities.

2013 results, and the Company’s capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.







Geographic Area Overviews

During 2013, we had exploration and production interests in six countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, Australia, the U.K. North Sea, and
Argentina. Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key 2013 data for each of our operating areas. Additional data and
discussion is provided in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K.

North America

Apache’s North American asset base primarily comprises operations in the Permian Basin, the Anadarko basin in western Oklahoma and the
Texas Panhandle, Gulf Coast onshore and offshore areas of the U.S., and in Western Canada. We also have leasehold acreage holdings in the Cook Inlet of Alaska and other areas where we are pursuing exploration opportunities. Over the past several
years, the Company has acquired significant acreage positions in many attractive basins and plays across North America. This extensive portfolio expansion phase shifted during 2013 when we completed strategic divestitures to rebalance our portfolio
to an asset mix that we believe will continue to generate strong returns, drive more predictable growth and deliver increased value to our shareholders. As part of this effort, Apache’s drilling activity has focused on our North America onshore
assets, which had liquids growth of 34 percent during 2013, primarily in the Permian Basin and Anadarko basin.

North America contributed
approximately 58 percent of our worldwide production and 50 percent of our oil and gas production revenues for the year. At year-end 2013, North America held 68 percent of our estimated worldwide proved reserves including noncontrolling interests in
Egypt.

United States

OverviewWe have access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across our 11.5 million gross acres in the U.S., approximately 75
percent of which is undeveloped. In 2013, 61 percent of our U.S. production and 67 percent of our U.S. year-end reserves were oil and natural gas liquids. Approximately 44 percent of Apache’s worldwide equivalent 2013 production and 51 percent
of our estimated proved reserves were in the U.S. To better control our development efforts across broad acreage positions within the U.S., during 2013 our assets were divided into five regions: Permian, Central, Gulf Coast Onshore, Gulf of Mexico
Deepwater, and the Gulf of Mexico Shelf. In 2014, the Gulf of Mexico Shelf region and Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region have been combined into the Gulf of Mexico region.







Permian RegionOur Permian region controls over 3.3 million gross acres with
exposure to numerous plays across the Permian Basin. Apache is one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, with more than 13,500 producing wells in 155 fields, including 47 waterfloods and seven
CO2floods. Total region production for 2013 was up over 17 percent sequentially as a result of an active drilling program where we ran an average of 42 rigs during the year. Production in the
region has increased for 12 consecutive quarters. During the year, we drilled or participated in drilling 785 wells, of which 186 were horizontal. The Permian region’s year-end 2013 estimated proved reserves were 910 MMboe, representing 14
percent growth over year-end 2012.

A key focus area of our activity during the year continued to be the multi-zone development of the
Deadwood area. Deadwood is the most active of our plays in the Midland basin where we ran an average of nearly 10 rigs and drilled 189 wells. Our activity in the Deadwood area is primarily drilling vertical wells targeting the Wolfwood and the
Fusselman zones.

Over the past several years, the region has been testing numerous formations and building a large inventory of
horizontal opportunities in several plays across our acreage position. Our success has led the region to increase the number of horizontal drilling rigs being utilized throughout 2013, and now approximately half of our rigs are drilling horizontal
wells. In 2013, we ramped up multi-rig development programs in several horizontal plays in the Midland basin, targeting the Wolfcamp and Cline Shales. We have also increased development activity in our Yeso area of New Mexico and across the
Permian’s Central Basin Platform. These extensive programs will carry into 2014 and drive the region’s growth.

We continue to
balance large development programs with exploration activity in several new areas. Given its acreage holdings, recent seismic data acquisitions and continued exploration efforts, the region has built a deep portfolio of drilling inventory and
opportunities to sustain our activity for many years. For 2014, the Permian region plans to invest approximately $2.55 billion. The region’s capital program covers planned expenditures for drilling, completions, recompletion projects, equipment
upgrades, expansion of existing facilities and equipment, plugging and abandonment, seismic studies, and leasing additional acreage.

Central RegionThe Central region controls 1.8 million gross acres that are mostly held-by-production and includes more than
3,800 producing wells primarily in western Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle. The region was Apache’s first core area and has historically grown through low-risk, highly predictable exploitation. Over the last several years, the region has
aggressively targeted oil and liquids-rich gas plays through horizontal drilling across its acreage holdings. Oil and liquids production expanded during 2013, with oil production growth of 61 percent and NGL production more than doubling compared to
the prior year. Total region production in 2013 was 91 Mboe/d, of which 50 percent was oil and natural gas liquids. As of year-end, the Central region’s estimated proved reserves totaled 304 MMboe, an increase of nearly 14 percent from year-end
2012.

The primary factor driving the region’s growth in 2013 was an active drilling program where we ran an average of 24 rigs
during the year, over a 30 percent increase from the prior year. We drilled or participated in drilling 322 wells during 2013, with 98 percent being completed as producers.

The vast majority of our drilling activity has been in the Anadarko basin, which consists of a series of thick, stacked formations of
liquids-rich, low-permeability sandstones. The Company’s significant acreage position in the basin provides a robust drilling inventory for the next several years across numerous horizontal liquids plays, notably the Granite Wash, Tonkawa,
Marmaton, Cottage Grove, and Cleveland. In addition, in 2013 the region continued to invest in infrastructure facilities and contractually secure takeaway capacity.

In addition, in 2011 Apache acquired 92,000 contiguous net acres in the Whittenburg basin, located approximately 70 miles west of our Anadarko
basin properties. The region has operated two drilling rigs targeting vertical objectives in 2012 and 2013, completing 26 vertical wells into the Canyon Wash sand and achieving a peak production rate of 10 Mb/d and 16 MMcf/d. Apache has now turned
its attention to the prolific Canyon lime and is currently drilling its first horizontal test.







The Central region plans to run an average of 34 rigs during 2014 and invest approximately $1.75
billion for drilling, recompletions, equipment upgrades, and production enhancement projects.

Gulf Coast RegionsOur Gulf
Coast assets are primarily located in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas onshore and offshore Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. During 2013 the area was divided into three regions, which include the Gulf Coast Onshore, Gulf of
Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf of Mexico Shelf. In 2014, the Gulf of Mexico Shelf region and Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region have been combined into the Gulf of Mexico region.

Apache’s Gulf Coast Onshore region is known for its proven onshore and near-shore basins of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi where it has
a significant acreage position of approximately 1.3 million gross acres, including approximately 275,000 mineral fee acres. During the year, the region primarily drilled shallow and moderate-depth development wells and completed the
construction of gathering and processing facilities in our Atchafalaya Bay development project. The region also continued evaluating deeper exploitation opportunities and several unconventional resource plays, which included drilling three Eagle
Ford shale wells on our Southeast Texas acreage with plans to substantially increase activity in 2014. For the year, the region drilled or participated in drilling 43 wells and projects drilling approximately 90 wells in 2014.

In offshore waters greater than 500 feet deep, the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region is a relatively underexplored and oil-prone area that
provides exposure to significant reserve and production potential. The Company owns over 900,000 gross acres across nearly 170 blocks as of the end of 2013. The Deepwater region contributed approximately two percent of Apache’s worldwide
production with multiple projects and developments underway. The non-operated Lucius project, where Apache holds an 11.7 percent working interest, is currently under development with first production projected by year-end 2014. In addition, the
large scale non-operated Heidelberg project was sanctioned in late 2012. Apache has a 12.5 percent working interest in this development with first production projected for 2016.

Apache’s former Gulf of Mexico Shelf region, constituting Gulf assets in waters less than 500 feet deep, experienced a significant shift
during 2013 as the region’s producing base and associated infrastructure was sold to Fieldwood in September. As part of the transaction, Apache retained 50 percent of its ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below
production in developed blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. These retained interests cover approximately 2.5 million gross acres across 515 offshore blocks. Several wells are expected to be drilled during 2014, and we expect future
activities to provide a platform for continued exploration growth in this basin. Total region production in 2013 was 71 Mboe/d, reflecting nine months of Shelf production prior to the divestiture.

In 2014, Apache plans to invest approximately $550 million and $450 million in its Gulf Coast (formerly Gulf Coast Onshore) and Gulf of Mexico
regions, respectively. The capital will be spent on drilling, recompletion, and development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, seismic acquisitions, additional leasing activity, and plugging and abandonment of wells and
platforms.

U.S. MarketingIn general, most of our U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices. Also, from time
to time, the Company will enter into fixed physical sales contracts for durations of up to one-year. These physical sales volumes are typically sold at fixed prices over the term of the contract. Our natural gas is sold primarily to local
distribution companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. We strive to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk.

Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on a
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price, adjusted for quality, transportation and a market-reflective differential. The objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes
available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to
time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts for durations up to five years. These term contracts typically have a firm transport commitment and often provide for the higher of prevailing market prices from multiple market hubs.







Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand
conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

Canada

OverviewApache entered the Canadian market in 1995 and currently holds nearly 5.4 million gross acres across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. The region’s large acreage position provides portfolio diversification
as well as significant drilling opportunities. Our Canadian region provided approximately 14 percent of Apache’s 2013 worldwide production.

In 2013, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 143 wells in Canada, with a continued focus on increasing oil and liquids-rich gas
production. Reservoir modeling and horizontal drilling technology advanced several oil and liquids-rich gas plays in the Montney, Swan Hills, Viking, Bluesky, and Glauconite formations. Success with multi-stage fracture completions continues to
increase the scope of oil and liquids-rich gas drilling opportunities.

We also furthered our region’s shift toward an oil and
liquids-rich gas asset portfolio through several strategic divestitures of primarily dry gas assets during 2013. In September we completed the sale of certain Alberta producing assets for approximately $214 million. The assets comprised 621,000
gross acres (530,000 net acres) and more than 2,700 wells in the Nevis, North Grant Lands, and South Grant Lands areas. In October 2013, we completed two additional sales of producing properties in Saskatchewan and Alberta for $112 million. The
divested assets comprised approximately 4,000 operated and 1,300 non-operated wells, including our Hatton, St. Lina, Marten Hills, Snipe Lake, and Valhalla developments, as well as a portion of our Hawkeye producing properties. Combined, our 2013
divestitures totaled 13 percent of the region’s production.

The Kitimat LNG project will allow us to monetize large unconventional
natural gas resources in the Liard and Horn River basins in northern British Columbia. In February 2013, Apache completed a transaction with Chevron Canada Limited (Chevron Canada) under which each company became a 50 percent owner of the Kitimat
LNG plant, the Pacific Trail Pipelines Limited Partnership (PTP), and 644,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Horn River and Liard basins. Chevron Canada will operate the LNG plant and pipeline while Apache Canada will continue to operate the
upstream assets. The Kitimat plant has received all significant environmental approvals and a 20-year export license from the Canadian federal government. Although the project has not reached a final investment decision, we believe Chevron’s
experience in developing LNG projects and marketing expertise will assist in moving the development forward. In 2014, we plan to invest approximately $1.0 billion of capital in the Kitimat project, which includes the LNG plant as well as our
upstream assets in the Horn River and Liard basins. With a 50 percent project participation, Apache is actively evaluating ways to right-size its level of participation in the Kitimat LNG project.

Additionally, the region plans to invest approximately $600 million in drilling and development projects, equipment upgrades, and production
enhancement projects for our other upstream assets.

MarketingOur Canadian natural gas marketing activities focus on sales to
utilities, end-users, integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators, and marketers. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk in our portfolio. To diversify our market exposure, we
transport natural gas under firm transportation contracts to delivery points into the United States. We sell the majority of our Canadian gas on a monthly basis at either first-of-the-month or daily AECO index prices. Also, from time to time, the
Company will enter into fixed physical sales contracts for durations of up to one-year. These physical sales volumes are typically sold at fixed prices over the term of the contract.

Canadian crude oil production is sold to integrated major companies, refiners, and marketing companies based on a WTI price, adjusted for
quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential. The crude is transported by pipeline or truck within Western Canada to market hubs in Alberta and Manitoba where it is sold, allowing for a more diversified group of purchasers and a
higher netback price. A portion of our trucked barrels







are delivered and sold at rail terminals. We evaluate our transport options monthly to maximize our netback prices.

The region’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for
transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

International

Apache’s international assets are located in Egypt, Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North Sea, and Argentina. In 2013, international
assets contributed 42 percent of our production and 50 percent of our oil and gas revenues. At year-end 2013, 32 percent of our estimated proved reserves were located outside North America.

Egypt

OverviewOur activity in Egypt began in 1994 with our first Qarun discovery well, and today we are one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end, we held 9.8 million gross acres, with gross oil production of 198 Mb/d
and gross natural gas production of 912 MMcf/d in 2013, or 90 Mb/d and 356 MMcf/d net to Apache’s consolidated holdings. Although 3.0 million gross undeveloped acres expired in January 2014, we continue to pursue longer term extensions on
areas we believe provide attractive growth opportunities. Of our remaining acreage, 72 percent is undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future.

Our operations in Egypt are conducted pursuant to production-sharing agreements in 24 separate concessions, under which the contractor
partners pay all operating and capital expenditure costs for exploration and development. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 2 to 25 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial
discoveries or on a negotiated basis. A percentage of the production on development leases, usually up to 40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to recover operating and capital expenditure costs, with the balance generally allocated
between the contractor partners and the Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis. In 2013 Apache was granted 20 new development leases, representing one of our most successful years since our entry into Egypt.

Our growth in Egypt has been driven by an ongoing drilling program, and we have historically been one of the most active drillers in the
Western Desert. During 2013, we drilled 181 development and injection wells and 54 exploration wells. Approximately 60 percent of our exploration wells were successful, further expanding our presence in the westernmost concessions and unlocking
additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable our technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new
targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations.

Apache has also made a strategic
decision to advance the application of horizontal drilling technology to unlock new plays in Egypt. During the year, we drilled our first well of a multi-well horizontal drilling program in the Abu Gharadig field. During December, this well produced
an average of 1,681 b/d and 3 MMcf/d from a 1,970 foot lateral. This well was one of eight horizontal wells initiated during 2013 to test the technology’s ability to increase recoveries in a variety of conventional and unconventional
reservoirs. Additional horizontal drilling is planned in the Abu Gharadig and surrounding fields in 2014.

In November 2013, Apache
announced the completion of the sale of a one-third minority interest in its Egypt oil and gas business to Sinopec. After customary closing adjustments, Apache received cash consideration of $2.95 billion. At year-end 2013, our Egypt region’s
estimated proved reserves were 271 MMboe, of which 90







MMboe is attributable to Sinopec’s noncontrolling interest. Our estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share
of reserves.

Heading into 2014, the region will continue an active drilling program and plans to invest approximately $1.4 billion,
including approximately $460 million attributable to Sinopec’s noncontrolling interest, for drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, and seismic acquisition.

MarketingOur gas production is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude
oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. The region averaged $2.99 per Mcf in 2013.

Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession, and other nearby Western Desert blocks is sold to third parties in the export market or
to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil sales are exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production that is presently sold to EGPC is sold on a spot basis priced at Brent with a monthly EGPC
official differential applied.

Egypt political unrestIn February 2011, former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down, and
the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took power, announcing that it would remain in power until presidential and parliamentary elections could be held. In June 2012, President Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and
Justice Party was elected as Egypt’s new president.

In July 2013, the Egyptian military removed President Morsi from power and
installed Egypt’s Chief Justice, Adly Mansour, as acting president of a temporary government, which announced that it would seek to schedule parliamentary and presidential elections in early to mid-2014. In January 2014, Egyptians voted on and
overwhelmingly approved a new constitution, and Mr. Mansour announced that the presidential election will be held prior to the parliamentary elections. While the date of the presidential election has not been announced, it is expected to be
held by mid-April 2014.

Apache’s operations, located in remote locations in the Western Desert, have not experienced production
interruptions, and we have continued to receive development lease approvals for our drilling program. However, a further deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as
changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) and other highly rated international insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these insurance policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $856 million of coverage
to Apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $149 million sub-limit for currency inconvertibility.

In addition, Apache has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $300 million of coverage for losses arising from (1) non-payment by
EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. In October
2012, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, announced that it was providing $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC for the remainder of the policy term. This provision of long-term reinsurance to OPIC
will allow Apache to maintain the $300 million of insurance coverage through 2024.

Australia

OverviewApache’s holdings in Australia are focused offshore Western Australia in the Carnarvon, Exmouth, and Browse basins,
with production operations in the Carnarvon and Exmouth basins. We have







operated in the Carnarvon basin since acquiring the gas processing facilities on Varanus Island and adjacent producing properties in 1993. In total, we control approximately 7.9 million
gross acres offshore Western Australia through 30 exploration permits, 18 production licenses, and 9 retention leases. Approximately 89 percent of our acreage is undeveloped, and the region continues to actively pursue additional acreage
opportunities.

During 2013, the region had net production of 19 Mb/d and 223 MMcf/d, contributing 7 percent of Apache’s worldwide
consolidated production revenue, 7 percent of worldwide consolidated production and 12 percent of year-end consolidated proved reserves. Production compared to the prior year was 12 percent lower primarily as a result of natural decline in the
Pyrenees and Van Gogh oil fields.

Partially offsetting production declines from Pyrenees and Van Gogh was production through the BHP
Billiton-operated Macedon gas plant, which commenced operations in the third quarter of 2013. The $1.5 billion natural gas facility, Western Australia’s fourth domestic gas hub, has a production capacity of approximately 200 MMcf/d. Gas is
delivered to the facility via a 60-mile pipeline from four completed subsea gas wells in the Macedon field. Apache has successfully marketed production in the Macedon field under long-term contracts at prices higher than historical realizations. We
have a 28.57 percent non-operating working interest in the field and gas plant. Apache has a participating interest in three of the four domestic gas hubs in Australia.

The region participated in drilling 12 offshore wells during 2013, of which 4 were exploration or appraisal wells, compared to 15 wells
drilled in 2012. Over the past decade, the region’s exploration activity has established a significant pipeline of projects that are expected to contribute to production growth as they are brought online in the coming years.

Development of the Coniston oil field project, which lies just north of the Van Gogh field, continued toward projected first production in
2014. The field will be produced via subsea completions tied back to the Ningaloo Vision Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessel (FPSO) at Van Gogh. Required modifications to the FPSO and the final phase of subsea installation work is
planned for the first half of 2014. Apache has a 52.5 percent working interest in the field.

The region also continued development of the
Balnaves field, an oil discovery located near the Brunello gas field. Development well drilling commenced in the third quarter of 2013, and the project is expected to begin production by the third quarter of 2014 utilizing a leased FPSO vessel.
Apache has a 65 percent working interest in the project.

In 2013, further advances were made on the region’s largest development
effort, which is the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG project (Wheatstone). The first phase of the Wheatstone project will comprise two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of approximately 8.9 million metric tons per annum (mtpa), a
domestic gas plant, and associated infrastructure. Apache has a 13 percent interest in the project and expects to invest approximately $4 billion over five years for the field and LNG facility development. Apache will supply gas to Wheatstone from
its operated Julimar and Brunello complex. The 65 percent interest in the Julimar development project is expected to generate average net sales to Apache of approximately 140 MMcf/d of gas (equivalent to 1.07 million mtpa of LNG) at prices
pegged to world oil markets, 22 MMcf/d of sales gas into the domestic market, and 3,250 barrels of condensate per day. First production is projected for the end of 2016.

These development projects require significant capital investments above those for traditional drilling programs. During 2014, the region
plans to invest approximately $800 million for drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition. Approximately $1.4 billion of additional 2014 capital will be
invested in the Wheatstone development project.

MarketingWestern Australia has historically had a local market for natural gas
with a limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in sales under mostly long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain







periodic price revision clauses based on either the Australian consumer price index or a commodity linkage. As of December 31, 2013, Apache had 21 active gas contracts in Australia with
expiration dates ranging from August 2014 to December 2026. Recent increases in demand and higher development costs have increased the prices required from the local market in order to support the development of new supplies. As a result, market
prices negotiated on recent contracts are substantially higher than historical levels.

We directly market all of our Australian crude oil
production into Australian domestic and international markets at prices generally indexed to Dated Brent benchmark crude oil prices plus premiums, which typically result in sales well above crude sold at WTI-based prices.

During 2013 Apache finalized binding Sales and Purchase Agreements with two Asian customers for the delivery of approximately 25 percent of
Apache’s net LNG offtake from Wheatstone.

North Sea

OverviewApache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties).
Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of acquired 3-D and 4-D seismic data. Building upon its success in Forties, Apache
in 2012 acquired Mobil North Sea Limited (Mobil North Sea), providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland
fields and non-operated interests in the Maclure, Scott, and Telford fields. In total, Apache has interests in approximately 1.2 million gross acres in the U.K. North Sea.

In 2013, the North Sea region produced 65 Mb/d and 51 MMcf/d, contributing 17 percent of Apache’s worldwide consolidated production
revenue, 10 percent of worldwide consolidated production, and 6 percent of year-end consolidated proved reserves. During the year we drilled 19 wells in the North Sea, of which 17 were productive. Apache’s drilling success was highlighted with
discoveries in the Tonto oil field. The Tonto-1 well, completed in April, had initial production of 10.3 Mb/d, and the Tonto-2 well, completed in September, had initial production of 8.3 Mb/d. Apache has a 100 percent working interest in the wells.
The Tonto discovery follows Maule and Bacchus as the third new field brought online by Apache in the Forties area over the last three years. All three fields qualify for the U.K.’s small field allowance, which provides economic incentives for
operators to bring discoveries from small fields into production. During the fourth quarter the region continued to commission the Forties Alpha Satellite Platform, adjacent to the main Forties Alpha platform. This platform has been constructed to
exploit new opportunities at Forties and provides an additional 18 drilling slots as well as power generation, fluid separation, and gas lift compression.

In 2014, the region plans to invest approximately $900 million on drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition, focusing on both the Beryl field and Forties area.

MarketingWe have
traditionally sold our North Sea crude oil under both term contracts and spot cargoes. The Forties term sales are composed of a market-based index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements. The prices
received for Beryl spot cargoes are market driven and can trade at a premium to the market-based index.

Natural gas from the Beryl field
is processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed
further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.







Argentina

OverviewWe have had a continuous presence in Argentina since 2001 and have grown our holdings in the region through an active drilling
program and targeted acquisitions. The region has active operations in the provinces of Neuquén, Rio Negro, and Tierra del Fuego. As of year-end 2013, Apache held interests in 31 concessions, exploration permits, and other interests totaling
3.3 million gross acres in three of the main Argentine hydrocarbon basins: Neuquén, Austral, and Cuyo. These concessions have varying expiration dates ranging from one year to over 15 years remaining, subject to potential extensions. In
2013, Argentina produced 6 percent of our worldwide consolidated production and held 4 percent of our year-end consolidated proved reserves.

On February 12, 2014, Apache announced an agreement to sell all of its operations in Argentina to YPF for cash consideration of $800
million plus the assumption of $52 million of bank debt as of June 30, 2013. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2014.

Marketing

Natural
GasApache sells its natural gas in Argentina through three different pricing structures:



•Gas Plus Program: This program was instituted by the Argentine government in 2008 to encourage investments for new gas supplies through the development of conventional and unconventional (tight sands) reserves. Under
this program, Apache is allowed to sell gas from qualifying projects at prices that are above the regulated rates. During 2013, the average Gas Plus volume sold by Apache was 79.9 MMcf/d at an average price of $4.90 per Mcf.



•Government-regulated pricing: The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the Argentine government and vary based on seasonal factors and category. During 2013, we realized an average price of
$0.78 per Mcf on government-regulated sales.



•Unregulated market: In 2013, realizations on sales in the unregulated market averaged $3.69 per Mcf.

In 2013, we realized an average price of $2.96 per Mcf in the region.

Crude OilThe crude oil in Argentina is subject to an export tax which effectively limits the prices buyers are willing to pay for
domestic sales. In 2013 there was an increase on the price of the crude paid by refiners, a combination of an increase of the sales price of fuels to end-users and the decrease of domestic production. Apache´s average sales price in Argentina
during 2013 was $79.05 per barrel.

Other Exploration

New Ventures

Apache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core
areas and targeting higher-risk, high-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. During 2014, we plan to invest approximately $75 million to further several projects and continue pursuing
additional exploration opportunities.

Major Customers

In 2013, 2012, and 2011 purchases by Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries accounted for 24 percent, 20 percent, and 11 percent,
respectively, of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues. In 2011, purchases by the Vitol Group accounted for 13 percent of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues.







Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in 2013 we participated in drilling 1,591 gross wells, with 1,520 (96 percent) completed as producers. Historically, our drilling
activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, our operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In
addition to our completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 160 in the U.S. (115.4 net); 17 in Egypt (17.0 net); and 2 in Argentina (0.3 net).

The following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years:

Gross and Net
Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out our gross and net acreage position as of December 31, 2013, in
each country where we have operations:

As of December 31, 2013, Apache had 3.2 million net undeveloped acres scheduled to
expire by year-end 2014 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 2.7 million and 1.9 million net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We strive to
extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third
parties including governments.

Exploration concessions in our Egypt region comprise a significant portion of our net undeveloped acreage
expiring over the next three years. We have 1.5 million net acres in Egypt scheduled to expire in 2014, and 1.0 million and 0.9 million net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Nearly all of the acreage
expiring in 2014 was relinquished in January. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist and over the past year has
been successful in being awarded six-month extensions on targeted concessions. Longer term extensions are also being finalized with EGPC.

As of December 31, 2013, 23 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage and 54 percent of Canadian undeveloped acreage was held by
production.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be
recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host
country’s share of reserves.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing
wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or
where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled
within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.







The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of December 31, 2013, based
on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2013, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which
natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a 6:1 energy equivalent ratio. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

(1)Includes total proved reserves of 90 MMboe attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt

As of December 31, 2013, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of 1,131 MMbbls of crude oil, 292 MMbbls of NGLs, and 7.3 Tcf of
natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the energy equivalent of 2.65 billion barrels of oil or 15.9 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 43 percent. As of December 31, 2013, the Company’s proved developed
reserves totaled 1,833 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled 813 MMboe, or approximately 31 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011,
changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 14—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set
forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day
of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of 813 MMboe as of December 31, 2013, decreased by 57 MMboe from 870 MMboe of PUD reserves
estimated at the end of 2012. During the year, Apache converted 154 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In North America, we converted 124 MMboe, with the remaining 30 MMboe in our international
areas. We sold 109 MMboe and acquired 1 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year. We added 205 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries.







During the year, a total of approximately $3.7 billion was spent on projects associated with
reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of 2012. A portion of our costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. We spent $2.1 billion on PUD reserve
development activity in North America and $1.6 billion in the international areas. Other than our Julimar/Brunello development project, which is tied to the construction schedule of the Wheatstone LNG project, with projected first production in
2016, we had no material amounts of PUD reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more after they were initially disclosed as PUD reserves and no material amounts of PUD reserves which are scheduled to be developed beyond five years
from December 31, 2013.

Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are
reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the
property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s
operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to
which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly
basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation
of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of industry experience with positions of
increasing responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is
responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and
gas reserves. Apache selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. We also consider other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During 2013, the
properties selected for each country ranged from 83 to 100 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 86 percent of the reserves value of our international proved reserves and of the
new wells drilled in each country. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The review covered 86 percent of total proved reserves,
including 89 percent of proved developed reserves and 79 percent of PUD reserves.

During 2013, 2012, and 2011, Ryder Scott’s review
covered 92, 88, and 81 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 86, 83, and 70 percent, respectively, of the Company’s total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scott’s review of 2013 covered 84
percent of U.S., 82 percent of Canada, 63 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 88 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s review of 2012 covered 81 percent of U.S., 78 percent of
Canada, 64 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 84 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s review of 2011 covered 68 percent of U.S., 69 percent of Canada, 58 percent of Argentina, 99
percent of Australia, 62 percent of Egypt, and 61 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves. We have filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.







According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical
processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties
as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Title to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate professionals or
counsel, is made at the time we acquire properties. We believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject only to
immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other
outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or
governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other
encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations.

Additional Information about Apache

In this section, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Apache” include Apache Corporation and its
consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically stated.

Remediation Plans and Procedures

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of
Mexico operations to ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties as required by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) 30 CFR 254.30. Annually, drills are
conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans. These drills include the participation of spill response contractors, representatives of Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), and representatives of governmental agencies. In the event of a
spill, CGA is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Apache and ADW have received approval for the Plans from BSEE. Apache and ADW personnel each review their respective Plan biennially and update where necessary.







Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline
companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a spill,
CGA’s equipment, which is positioned at various staging points around the Gulf, is ready to be mobilized. In addition, CGA has contracted with Airborne Support Inc. to provide aircraft and dispersant capabilities for CGA member companies. In
2013, Apache incurred charges for CGA of approximately $700,000 based on a per-member fee and annual production.

An Apache subsidiary is also a member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) to help the Company fulfill the
government’s permit requirements for containment and oil spill response plans in deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. MWCC is a not-for-profit, stand-alone organization whose goal is to improve capabilities for containing an underwater well
control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Members and their affiliates have access to MWCC’s extensive containment network and systems. As of December 31, 2013, Apache’s investment in MWCC totals approximately $136 million.

Apache also participates in a number of industry-wide task forces that are studying ways to better access and control blowouts in subsea
environments and increase containment and recovery methods. Two such task forces are the Subsea Well Control and Containment Task Force and the Offshore Operating Procedures Task Force.

Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases,
equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and in the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and
gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic
long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.







However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage
positions and well-established production bases across six countries, and our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of
our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the six countries in which we have producing operations to which we can
reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, local, and
foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution
clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry, as
a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business
costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established
operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are
inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been
adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
