ITEMS 1 and 2.BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

Business Strategy

Our VISION is to be a premier exploration and production company.

Our MISSION is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.

Our STRATEGY is to deliver top-tier returns by maximizing recovery and minimizing costs through continuous improvement. Apache’s long-term perspective is centered on the following core strategic components:

•optimization of returns

•disciplined financial structure

•rigorous portfolio management

Over the past several years, Apache entered into a series of transactions that upgraded its portfolio of assets, enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize returns and long-term shareholder value, and successfully completed a strategic shift from its historical acquisition and exploitation focus to one of internally generated exploration with full-cycle, returns-focused growth.

Rigorous management of the Company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term. Specifically, we reduced capital investment in 2015 and 2016 to align with cash flow in a lower commodity price environment and allowed production to decline rather than pursue growth in an unfavorable service cost environment. Additionally, the Company monetized certain capital-intensive investments that were not accretive to earnings in the near term and other non-strategic assets. These divestitures included all of Apache’s operations in Australia and Canada, including LNG facility investments, its interest in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation system (SAGE) and pipeline in the North Sea, and various non-core leasehold positions in North America. The Company made strategic decisions to allocate the proceeds of these asset divestitures to more impactful development opportunities, including development of our Alpine High discovery in the Delaware Basin. These actions have enabled us to focus








our investments on improving long-term returns, maintain our dividend, and reduce debt without diluting shareholders through issuing equity.

We now have a diversified portfolio that features strong free cash flow generating assets in Egypt and the North Sea, which benefit from premium Brent crude oil pricing, and top-tier assets in the Permian Basin, the combination of which are the Company’s foundation for returns-focused growth.

For a more in-depth discussion of the Company’s2017results, divestitures, strategy, and its capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

Geographic Area Overviews

Apache has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and the North Sea. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key2017data for each of Apache’s operating areas. Additional data and discussion is provided in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

(1)During the third quarter of 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian operations.

(2)Apache’s operations in Egypt, excluding a one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed27 percentof2017production and accounted for15 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves.

(3)Sales volumes from the North Sea for2017were21.2MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

North America

In2017, Apache’s North American operations contributed approximately 52 percent of production and 69 percent of estimated year-end proved reserves. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 6.7 million gross acres in North America, 71 percent of which are undeveloped.

In North America, Apache has two onshore regions:

•The Permian region located in west Texas and New Mexico includes the Permian sub-basins, the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays within this region include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry.

•The Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region includes the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Marmaton, Cleveland, and other formations of the West Anadarko Basin, the Canyon Lime formation in the Texas panhandle, the Woodford-SCOOP and Stack plays located in central Oklahoma, and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas.

Apache also has one offshore region in North America, the Gulf of Mexico region, which consists of both shallow and deep water exploration and production activities. Apache exited its Canadian operations in August 2017.








Permian RegionThe Permian region is one of Apache’s core growth areas. Highlights of the Company’s operations in the region include:

•Over 2.8 million gross acres with exposure to numerous plays focused primarily in the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and the Delaware Basin.

•Estimated proved reserves of 681 MMboe at year-end 2017, representing 58 percent of the Company’s worldwide proved reserves.

•Annual production of157.8Mboe/d declined only2 percentfrom 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 production increased 10 percent from the prior sequential quarter, a reflection of the success of the Midland Basin drilling program and the continued production ramp up at Alpine High, which first came online in May 2017.

•In 2017, the Permian region averaged 16 rigs and drilled or participated in 215 wells, 158 of which were horizontal, with a 97 percent success rate.

In addition to activity in Alpine High, the Permian region drilled or participated in 170 wells in 2017, with a 99 percent success rate.

Apache plans to continue this elevated level of activity in the Permian region during 2018, while continuing to balance capital investments between its larger development project at Alpine High and focused exploration and development programs on other core assets in its Permian region. During 2018, the Company expects to average approximately 14 drilling rigs, which includes six to seven rigs at Alpine High focused on a combination of retention, development, and delineation drilling. Approximately $1.6 billion, or roughly two-thirds, of the Company’s 2018 capital upstream budget will be allocated to the Permian region. The Company anticipates investment of $500 million in the midstream development of Alpine High in 2018.

Midcontinent/Gulf Coast RegionApache’s Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region includes 1.8 million gross acres and over 3,100 producing wells primarily in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas. In 2017, the region accounted for 9 percent of the Company’s production and approximately 10 percent of the Company’s year-end estimated proved reserves.

In 2017, Apache reduced capital activity in the region and drilled only three operated wells during the year, which were all productive. The Company began allocating additional capital to the region in the fourth quarter, focusing on retaining acreage. In 2018, Apache plans to run a targeted program, drilling additional wells in the Woodford-SCOOP play. In addition, the region will continue its focus on high grading acreage and building its inventory of future drilling locations.

Gulf of Mexico RegionThe Gulf of Mexico region comprises assets in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana. In addition to its interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases, when the Company sold in 2013 substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50 percent ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in development blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. Apache’s offshore technical teams continue to focus on evaluating subsalt and other deeper exploration opportunities in water depths less than 1,000 feet, which have been relatively untested by the industry, where high-potential deep hydrocarbon plays may exist. During 2017, Apache’s Gulf of Mexico region contributed6.1Mboe/d to the Company’s total production.








Canada RegionOn June 30, 2017, Apache completed the sale of its Canadian assets at Midale and House Mountain for cash proceeds of approximately $228 million. In August 2017, Apache completed the sale of its remaining Canadian operations for cash proceeds of approximately $478 million. The sale of Apache’s Canadian operations further streamlines its portfolio, enabling the Company to allocate a higher percentage of capital to the Permian Basin. In 2017, the region accounted for 7 percent of the Company’s production.

North America MarketingIn general, most of the Company’s North American gas is sold at either monthly or daily index based prices.  The tenor of the Company’s sales contracts span from daily to multi-year transactions. Natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution, utility, and midstream companies as well as end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk.  In 2017, Apache began selling gas that was consumed in Mexico and to the only operational LNG export facility in the US.

In December 2017, Apache announced it had secured 500 MMcf/d of natural gas transport capacity via the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX Project). The GCX Project will connect the Waha Hub near Coyanosa, Texas in the Permian Basin to Agua Dulce, Texas near the Texas Gulf Coast and will provide Apache access to domestic industrial and utility users as well as incremental demand for LNG exports and Mexico markets. As a significant shipper on the GCX line, Apache has also secured an option for up to a 15 percent equity stake in the pipeline. This takeaway capacity will allow greater flexibility and market optionality for Apache’s Permian production, including increasing volumes from Alpine High. The GCX pipeline is a joint project of Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC, a subsidiary of Kinder Morgan, Inc., DCP Midstream, LP, and an affiliate of Targa Resources Corp. The project is expected to be in service in October 2019, pending the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals.

Apache primarily markets its North American crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential.

In the U.S., Apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts for durations up to five years. These term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide for the higher of prevailing market prices from multiple market hubs.

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

International

In2017, international assets contributed48 percentof Apache’s production and57 percentof oil and gas revenues. Approximately31 percentof estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside North America.

Apache has two international regions:

•The Egypt region includes onshore conventional assets in Egypt’s Western Desert.

•The North Sea region includes offshore assets based in the United Kingdom.

The Company also has an offshore exploration program in Suriname.

EgyptApache’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the contractor partner (Contractor) bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache’s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache’s production and reserves.








Apache has 22 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end 2017, the Company held 5.6 million gross acres in 25 separate concessions. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 4 to 20 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 69 percent of the Company’s gross acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future. During 2017, Apache received final approval of the NW Razzak and South Alam El Shawish concession blocks. Combined, the two concessions added approximately 1.6 million net undeveloped acres in Egypt.

The Company’s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves. In addition, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas operations in Egypt. The Egypt region, including the one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed35 percentof2017production,20 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves, and33 percentof estimated discounted future net cash flows. Excluding the noncontrolling interest, Egypt contributed27 percentof2017production,15 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves, and25 percentof estimated discounted future net cash flows.

In 2017, the region drilled 67 development and 27 exploration wells. Approximately 52 percent of the exploration wells were successful, further expanding Apache’s presence in the westernmost concessions and unlocking additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache’s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations. In September 2017, Apache began shooting high-resolution 3-D seismic surveys in the West Kalabsha concession, the first of its kind in the Western Desert. The Company will ultimately expand the shoot to cover the majority of its acreage in Egypt. The program will provide newer vintage, higher resolution imaging of the substrata across Apache’s Western Desert position, allowing the Company to build and high-grade its drilling inventory.

Egypt MarketingApache’s gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. The region averaged$2.80per Mcf in2017.

Oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices equivalent to the export market.

North SeaApache has interests in approximately 362,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. The region contributed13 percentof Apache’s 2017 production and approximately11 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of acquired 3-D and 4-D seismic data. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and a non-operated interest in the Maclure field. Apache also has a non-operated interest in the Nelson field. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. The North Sea region plays a strategic role in Apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with high-impact exploration potential.

During 2017, the region drilled 10 development wells with a 90 percent success rate: four at Forties, four at Beryl, and two at Callater. In addition, it drilled or participated in four exploration wells with a 25 percent success rate. Exploration success over the past three years has averaged 50 percent.

Apache progressed on the 2015 Callater exploration discovery in the Beryl area, with first production commencing in the second half of 2017. Apache currently has two highly productive wells at Callater, with a current oil cut of approximately 70 percent. Apache holds a 55 percent working interest in Callater and operates the field. Appraisal and development plans continue to be finalized on the Seagull and Corona discoveries, while the more recent Storr discovery continues to be evaluated. Apache holds a 35, 100, and 55 percent interest in the Seagull, Corona and Storr discoveries, respectively.

The Company plans to average three rigs in the North Sea for 2018, with two platform rigs (one at Forties and one at Beryl) and a semi-submersible rig.








North Sea MarketingApache has traditionally sold its North Sea crude oil under term contracts, with a market-based index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements.

Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation. As a result of the recent SAGE divestiture, Apache expects to incur additional tariffs in its North Sea region ranging from$7 millionto$10 millionannually.

AustraliaDuring the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets. Results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the divested Australia assets are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Exploration

New VenturesApache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. Apache drilled an exploration well in the first half of 2017 in offshore Suriname, which was unsuccessful. Plans for 2018 include continued analysis and review of the Company’s deepwater prospects offshore Suriname.

Delivery Commitments

Apache has certain long-term contracts with fixed minimum sales volume commitments for natural gas in the Permian Basin. These contracts require Apache to deliver approximately 144 bcf for the period from 2018 through 2020.

We expect to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production from our proved reserves. Any remaining commitments may be fulfilled with production from continued development and/or spot market purchases as necessary. We have not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by our sales commitments.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in2017, Apache participated in drilling 353 gross wells, with 323 (92 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache’s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, Apache’s operations outside of North America focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to Apache’s completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 126 gross (95.8 net) in the U.S., 18 gross (15.7 net) in Egypt, and 1 gross (0.5 net) in the North Sea.

The following table shows the results of the oil and gas wells drilled and completed for each of the last three fiscal years:

Gross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out Apache’s gross and net acreage position as ofDecember 31, 2017, in each country where the Company has operations:

As of December 31, 2017, 39 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage was held by production.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, Apache had 608,000 net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire by year-end2018if production is not established or Apache takes no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 806,000 and 2.1 million net undeveloped acres set to expire in2019and2020, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses








and concession areas through operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments.



Exploration concessions in Apache’s Egypt region comprise a significant portion of Apache’s net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. Apache has 354,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in Egypt during2018. Approximately 615,000 and 118,000 net undeveloped acres are set to expire in2019and2020, respectively. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist. During 2017, Apache received final approval of the NW Razzak and South Alam El Shawish concession blocks. Combined, the two concessions added approximately 1.6 million net undeveloped acres in Egypt.

Additionally, Apache has exploration interests in Suriname consisting of 1.8 million net undeveloped acres in two offshore blocks. Apache has acquired 3-D seismic surveys over all the acreage. No reserves have been booked on this undeveloped acreage.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.










The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as ofDecember 31, 2017, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in2017, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

As ofDecember 31, 2017, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of583MMbbls of crude oil,204MMbbls of NGLs, and2.3Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of1.2 billionbarrels of oil or 7.0 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 50 percent. As ofDecember 31, 2017, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled1,024MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled151MMboe, or approximately 13 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.

During2017, Apache added230MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity and2MMboe through purchases of minerals in-place. Apache sold a combined212MMboe primarily through divestitures transactions in Canada. During2017, Apache also had combinedupwardrevisions of previously estimated reserves of10MMboe. Changes in product prices accounted for32MMboe, offset by engineering and performance downward revisions totaling22MMboe.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as ofDecember 31, 2017,2016, and2015, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 15—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of151MMboe as ofDecember 31, 2017, increased by 14 MMboe from 137 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at the end of2016. During the year, Apache converted 60 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In North America, Apache converted 39 MMboe, with the remaining 21 MMboe in Apache’s international areas. Apache sold 42 MMboe and acquired 1 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year. Apache added 126 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Apache recognized a 17 MMboe downward engineering revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year, a 3 MMboe upward revision associated with product prices, and a 3 MMboe upward revision associated with interest revisions.

During the year, a total of approximately $369 million was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of2016. A portion of Apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. Apache spent approximately $201 million on PUD reserve development activity in North America and $168 million in the international areas. As ofDecember 31, 2017, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure.








Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and over 37 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During2017, the properties selected for each country ranged from 87 to 100 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 98 percent of the reserves value of our international proved reserves and 88 percent of the new wells drilled in each country. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The review covered 84 percent of total proved reserves by volume.

During2017,2016, and2015, Ryder Scott’s review covered 92, 92, and 90 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 84, 83, and 83 percent, respectively, of the Company’s total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scott’s review of2017covered 84 percent of U.S., 85 percent of Egypt, and 81 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of 2016 covered 81 percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 85 percent of Egypt, and 92 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of 2015 covered 81 percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 86 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

The Company has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Additional Information about Apache

Response Plans and Available Resources

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations and offshore operations in the North Sea and Suriname. These plans ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans.

Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRL’s services. Apache also has a contract for global response resources and services with National Response Corporation (NRC). NRC is the world’s largest commercial Oil Spill Response Organization and is the global leader in providing end-to-end environmental, industrial, and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries.

In the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a spill, CGA’s equipment, which is positioned at various staging points around the Gulf, is ready to be mobilized. In addition, ADW is a member of Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC), and their equipment and resources are also available to ADW for its deepwater Gulf of Mexico and new venture operations.

An Apache subsidiary is also a member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) to help the Company fulfill the government’s permit requirements for containment and oil spill response plans in deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. MWCC is a not-for-profit, stand-alone organization whose goal is to improve capabilities for containing an underwater well control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Members and their affiliates have access to MWCC’s extensive containment network and systems. As ofDecember 31, 2017, Apache’s investment in MWCC totaled $150 million and is reflected in “Deferred charges and other” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.








Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across three geographic areas, our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
