We hold interests in many of our United States (U.S.), Canadian
    and other international properties through subsidiaries,
    including Apache Canada Ltd., DEK Energy Company (DEKALB),
    Apache Energy Limited (AEL), Apache North America, Inc. and
    Apache Overseas, Inc. Properties to which we refer in this
    document may be held by those subsidiaries. We treat all
    operations as one line of business. References to
    “Apache” or the “Company” include Apache
    Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise
    specifically stated.



Growth
    Strategy



Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable upstream oil and
    gas company for the long-term benefit of our shareholders.
    Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, with
    the following core principles:



•own a balanced portfolio of core assets;•maintain financial flexibility and a strong balance
    sheet; and•optimize rates of return, earnings and cash flow.



Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have
    underpinned our ability to deliver long-term production and
    reserve growth and achieve competitive investment rates of
    return for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased
    reserves 22 out of the last 24 years and production 29 out
    of the past 31 years, a testament to our consistency over
    the long-term.



Portfolio
    of Assets



We own a portfolio of assets in core areas that provide
    opportunities for growth through drilling, supplemented by
    occasional strategic acquisitions. Over the last two decades, we
    have assembled a large acreage position and





production base outside the United States that provide
    additional geologic and geographic opportunities, diversifying
    risk, and provide exposure to larger reserve targets, which fuel
    production and reserve growth. We now have exploration and
    production operations in six countries, spanning five
    continents: the Gulf Coast and Central regions in the United
    States (U.S.), Canada, Egypt, the North Sea, Australia and
    Argentina. We also have exploration interests in Chile located
    adjacent to our Argentine operations on the Chilean side of the
    island of Tierra del Fuego.



Each of our producing regions has achieved an economy of scale
    that leads to cost effective production and sustainable,
    lower-risk, repeatable drilling opportunities. The net cash
    provided by operating activities (cash flow) generated by our
    current production base and our 33 million gross acres
    across the globe provide the ability to pursue new exploration
    targets while developing our previous exploration discoveries.
    Those developments will fund the next round of exploration
    activities and development programs.



We manage our investments giving consideration to geography,
    reserve life and hydrocarbon mix.



•No single region contributed more than 27 percent of our
    equivalent production or reserves in 2009.•The mixture of reserve life (estimated reserves divided by
    annual production) in our regions, which translates into balance
    in the timing of returns on our investments, ranges from as
    short as six years to as long as 21 years.•Our balanced product mix provides a measure of protection
    against price deterioration in a given product while retaining
    upside potential through a significant increase in either
    commodity price. In 2009 crude oil and liquids provided
    50 percent of our production and 72 percent of our
    revenue. At year-end, our estimated proved reserves were
    45 percent crude oil and liquids and 55 percent
    natural gas.



Financial
    Flexibility and a Strong Balance Sheet



Apache’s financial flexibility is the result of years of
    hard work and discipline. This flexibility permits us to pursue
    higher-risk, higher-reward exploration targets, to develop
    large-scale facilities required to produce previous exploration
    discoveries and, when appropriate, to supplement our drilling
    and exploration programs with value-creating acquisitions.



Given the turmoil in the commodity markets and nearly
    unprecedented global financial crisis at the outset of the year,
    Apache’s primary objective for 2009 was to live within our
    cash flow and preserve our financial flexibility. To ensure we
    lived within cash flow, we reduced our 2009 activity and
    invested $4.1 billion, 39 percent below 2008 levels.



Apache grew production nine percent and generated
    $4.2 billion in cash flow in 2009 in spite of curtailed
    capital spending. We exited 2009 with adebt-to-capitalizationratio of 24 percent, just over $2 billion of cash and
    $2.3 billion in available committed borrowing capacity. We
    also believe our single-A debt ratings provide a competitive
    advantage in accessing capital markets.



Optimize
    Returns on Invested Capital



We focus on optimizing returns on invested capital through
    strict cost control and the creative application of technology.



Our management systems provide a uniform process of measuring
    success across Apache. Our management systems incentivize high
    rate-of-return activities but allow for appropriate risk-taking
    to drive future growth. Results of operations and rates of
    return on invested capital are measured monthly, reviewed with
    management quarterly and utilized to determine annual
    performance awards. We monitor capital allocations, at least
    quarterly, through a disciplined and focused process that
    includes analyzing current economic conditions, expected rates
    of return on proposed development and exploration drilling
    targets, opportunities for tactical acquisitions or,
    occasionally, new core areas that could enhance our portfolio.



We also use technology to optimize our rates of return by
    reducing risk, decreasing drilling time and costs, and
    maximizing recoveries from reservoirs. Additionally, Apache
    scientists and engineers have been granted numerous





patents for a range of inventions, from systems used for
    interpreting seismic data or processing well logs to
    improvements in drilling and completion techniques.



One such example is a manifold invented for development of our
    Horn River Shale gas play in northeast British Columbia, where
    Apache is employing pad-drilling technology. Apache engineers
    developed and applied for a patent for a manifold that will
    connect all 16 horizontal wells on a single pad, driving down
    costs by reducing non-productive time on our24-hour-a-dayhydraulic fracturing operations. This technology will increase
    Apache’s rate of return on potentially thousands of future
    wells across our leasehold.



At our Forties field, Apache is using techniques that bring
    together many sources of data to give an accurate view of the
    current state of the field and identify likely places to find
    unswept oil deposits. Four-dimensional modeling, which uses
    reservoir-engineering data and a series of three-dimensional
    seismic surveys, is utilized by Apache to create a time-lapse
    picture that shows where oil remains after 35 years of
    production. The latest model of the reservoir highlighted the
    potential for stranded oil accumulations in close proximity to
    the Charlie platform and helped Apache’s technical teams
    identify the Charlie 6-3 target drilled in 2009. The well came
    on production at 10,500 b/d — the field’s highest
    initial production rate from a new well since 1994.



For a more in-depth discussion of our 2009 results and the
    Company’s capital resources and liquidity, please see
    Part II, Item 7 — Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations.



Geographic
    Area Overviews



We currently have exploration and production interests in six
    countries, divided into seven operating regions: the United
    States (Gulf Coast and Central regions), Canada, Egypt,
    Australia, offshore the United Kingdom in the North Sea and
    Argentina. We also have exploration interests on the Chilean
    side of the island of Tierra del Fuego, which we acquired in the
    second quarter of 2008.



The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of
    certain key 2009 data for each of our operating areas.
    Additional data and discussion is provided in Part II,

North
    America



Apache’s North American asset base comprises the
    U.S. Central region, U.S. Gulf Coast region and our
    Canada region. Oil and liquids production, mainly from the
    U.S. Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, made up





nearly 40 percent of North America’s
    2009 barrel-equivalent production and 46 percent of
    North America’s year-end estimated proved reserves. Our
    North American production is also balanced between the shorter
    reserve life but higher rates of return in the Gulf of Mexico
    and longer reserve life for Apache’s onshore assets in
    Canada and the Permian and Anadarko Basins of the United States.



As result of past growth and future opportunities available in
    the Central region, we have created a new regional unit
    beginning in 2010. Our Permian region will be based in Midland,
    Texas and will be responsible for our Permian Basin business.
    The Central region will focus on our extensive holdings in
    Oklahoma, East Texas and the Texas Panhandle, especially the
    Granite Wash play.



The identification and commercialization of significant
    resources in shale formations and other unconventional gas plays
    has changed the natural gas markets for the foreseeable future,
    with current estimates that North America has a100-yearresource of natural gas. Although Apache’s current
    production in North America is primarily conventional, near-term
    growth will likely be driven by activity in two large growth
    plays: shale gas in British Columbia’s Horn River Basin and
    the Granite Wash tight sands in the Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma
    and the Texas Panhandle. Apache has identified many years of
    drilling activity in both plays.



We anticipate that the increased supply of natural gas will
    ultimately encourage producers to seek new and unconventional
    markets for their supply. Apache is one of the first independent
    producers to seek global markets for its North American natural
    gas production through our acquisition of a 51-percent ownership
    and throughput capacity interest in the proposed Kitimat LNG
    Terminal in British Columbia.



In order to live within expected cash flow, Apache curtailed
    exploration and development capital at the outset of 2009. In
    North America we drilled 362 gross wells, down from
    1,015 wells in 2008. Exploration, drilling, and acquisition
    spending totaled $1.6 billion in 2009, 49 percent
    lower than in 2008. Despite lower activity and spending, we
    added 122.3 MMboe of estimated proved reserves through
    drilling and acquisitions in North America, 18.8 MMboe more
    than the 103.5 MMboe produced. Equivalent production from
    our North American regions declined one percentyear-over-year.



We are ramping up activity in early 2010 as we move into
    development mode at Horn River, increase drilling in the Granite
    Wash formation and double our oil drilling activity in the
    Permian Basin. In 2010, we currently plan to drill or
    participate in 561 gross wells in North America.



United
    States



OverviewIn the U.S., the Gulf Coast
    region’s assets, balanced between oil and natural gas,
    historically generate high rates of return on invested capital.
    Occasional acquisitions have played an important role, as steep
    decline rates mean offshore reserves are generally shorter-lived
    and difficult to replace on a cost-effective basis through
    drilling alone. The Central region brings the balance of
    long-lived reserves and consistent drilling results to the
    portfolio.



Gulf Coast RegionThis region comprises our
    interests in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas on and
    offshore Louisiana and Texas. Apache has been the largestheld-by-productionacreage owner since 2004, and the second largest producer on the
    Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of Mexico (waters less than
    1,200 feet deep). The region also holds 1.2 million
    gross acres along the Gulf Coast of Louisiana and Texas. In 2009
    the region contributed approximately 20 percent of our
    worldwide production, about 21 percent of our revenues and,
    at year-end, held nearly 13 percent of our estimated proved
    reserves.



The region had a productive year despite the capital curtailment
    stemming from lower commodity prices at the end of 2008. The
    region drilled or participated in 26 wells, down from
    116 wells in 2008, and performed 217 workovers and
    recompletions.



In May 2009 production commenced from two deepwater wells in the
    Geauxpher field, located on Garden Banks Block 462. During
    the second half of 2009, the field produced an average of91 MMcf/dgross. Apache generated the prospect and has a 40-percent
    working interest. We also announced another key deepwater
    discovery





in April 2009 at Ewing Banks 998 that test-flowed 4,254 b/d and5.4 MMcf/d.The well will be connected to existing facilities, with first
    production projected for mid-year 2010. Apache owns a 50-percent
    interest in the property.



The risk of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region has been an
    ongoing issue. Frequency, intensity and location of major
    hurricanes is impossible to predict. The majority of our Gulf of
    Mexico assets have enjoyed full-life cycles without suffering
    significant storm-related damage. While facilities are designed
    to withstand severe weather, they may incur significant damage
    when confronted by the most extreme hurricane conditions. Also,
    with mature facilities, proactive management includes aggressive
    well and equipment abandonment that should minimize the
    environmental impact and reduce the eventual cost of remediation.



This damage may result in expenses for repairs to restore
    production as well as expenses to remove and abandon wreckage.
    During 2009, approximately $64 million in excess of
    insurance proceeds was spent to repair damage stemming from 2008
    hurricanes. An additional $260 million in excess of
    insurance proceeds was expended for the continued abandonment
    and removal of wreckage from platforms toppled in hurricanes.
    Cash expended for abandonment activities reduces our asset
    retirement obligation. The majority of the hurricane abandonment
    work is now complete.



During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects, seismic acquisition and
    abandonment activities.



Central RegionThe Central region includes
    assets in the Anadarko Basin, the East Texas Basin and the
    Permian Basin. Over the past decade, the region has grown from
    approximately 3,000 wells to over 10,000 and now represents
    27 percent of Apache’s proved reserves, the largest
    concentration in the Company. The region provides steady,
    predictable results, enhanced by assets across a large acreage
    base. During 2009 Apache operated or participated in drilling
    135 wells; 99 percent were completed as producers. The
    region also performed 810 workovers and recompletions.



In 2009 we drilled our first operated horizontal well in the
    Granite Wash play in Washita County, Oklahoma. The
    Hostetter #1-23H commenced production in September 2009 at17 MMcf/dand 800 b/d and is currently producing9.5 MMcf/dand 600 b/d. Apache owns a 72-percent working interest in the
    well. The Granite Wash has long been a core-stacked pay target
    for the Central Region, where we have drilled many vertical
    wells over the past decade. As a result, we control
    approximately 200,000 gross acres in the play, mostlyheld-by-production.Despite the numerous vertical wells drilled, the Granite Wash is
    re-emerging as a horizontal play that is capitalizing on high
    oil prices given the rich liquids yield of the wells. Hundreds
    of additional horizontal well locations have been identified
    across our acreage, extending opportunities for many years. In
    early 2010 we had three rigs in operation with plans to increase
    to at least five as we target drilling a minimum of 29
    horizontal wells in the play during the year.



During 2010 the Central region plans to invest approximately
    $325 million to $375 million for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition in the
    Anadarko Basin and East Texas. Our newly formed Permian Region
    plans to invest approximately $375 million to
    $400 million for similar activities, primarily directed at
    oil targets.



MarketingIn general, most of our
    U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices.
    Our natural gas is sold primarily to Local Distribution
    Companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, and integrated major oil
    companies.



Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated
    major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies and
    refiners. The objective is to maximize the value of crude oil
    sold by identifying the best markets and most economical
    transportation routes available to move the product. Sales
    contracts are generally30-dayevergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by
    either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced
    daily at prevailing market prices.



Canada



OverviewAt year-end 2009 our Canadian region
    held approximately 22 percent of our estimated proved
    reserves, the second largest concentration in the Company. In
    our Canadian region, we have 4.4 million net acres





across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta and
    Saskatchewan. Our acreage base provides a significant inventory
    of both low-risk development drilling opportunities in and
    around a number of Apache fields and higher-risk, higher-reward
    exploration opportunities. In 2009 we drilled or participated in
    201 wells in Canada, 41 of which were in the Horn River
    Basin. Three of the region’s wells drilled during the year
    were exploration wells, all of which were productive.



Apache and EnCana Corporation (EnCana), 50-percent partners,
    control more than 400,000 acres in the Horn River Basin
    shale-gas play in northeast British Columbia. We estimate that
    we could ultimately drill thousands of wells. In 2009
    Apache and EnCana drilled 41 wells in the Basin: 23 by
    Apache and 18 by EnCana. To minimize the environmental footprint
    and costs, the wells are drilled in batches from multi-well
    pads. Completion activity commences once drilling operations
    from a single pad have been completed, allowing room for the
    equipment needed for fracturing operations to service the entire
    pad. Four of the EnCana-operated wells were placed on production
    in 2009 and at year-end were producing at a combined gross rate
    in excess of19 MMcf/d.Apache commenced stimulating the 16 wells on its first
    operated development pad in the fourth quarter of 2009, with
    production scheduled for mid-2010.



The magnitude of the Horn River resource, its remote location,
    and the desire to maximize returns prompted Apache to seek
    alternative markets for its natural gas. On January 13,
    2010, we announced that our Apache Canada Ltd. subsidiary agreed
    to acquire 51-percent ownership and throughput capacity interest
    in Kitimat LNG Inc.’s proposed LNG export terminal in
    northern British Columbia. We expect to begin front-end
    engineering and design (FEED) of the project in early 2010. If
    we proceed with development, Apache’s net capacity in the
    facility will provide an outlet for350 MMcf/dfrom Horn River and other areas in Canada, providing access to
    markets with worldwide LNG prices. Preliminary gross
    construction cost estimates, which will be refined upon
    completion of the FEED study, total C$3 billion. A final
    investment decision (FID) is expected in 2011. If we proceed,
    initial gas exports are forecast for as early as 2014. Kitimat
    is designed to be linked to the pipeline system servicing
    Western Canada’s natural gas producing regions via the
    proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines, a C$1.1 billion project.
    In association with our acquisition of interest in the Kitimat
    project, we also acquired a 25.5-percent interest in the
    proposed pipeline and 350 MMcf/d of capacity rights.



In December 2009, we entered into a farm-in agreement with
    Corridor Resources Inc. (Corridor) to appraise and potentially
    develop oil and natural gas resources in the province of New
    Brunswick. The initial18-monthprogram is intended to evaluate the commercial potential of
    natural gas development in the Frederick Brook formation and
    light oil development at a recent Caledonia oil discovery at a
    cost to Apache of not less than $25 million. Upon
    completion of this appraisal program, Apache will have earned a
    50-percent working interest in the spacing units drilled. Apache
    will then have the option to participate in phase two of the
    program at a cost of not less than $100 million. Upon
    completion of this phase by March 31, 2013, Apache would
    earn a 50-percent interest in approximately 116,000 acres.



Our plans for 2010 are to drill or participate in a total of
    172 wells in Canada, including 156 development wells
    and 16 exploratory wells. The planned development wells include
    34 new wells in the Horn River Basin, with Apache drilling 18
    and EnCana drilling 16. We believe our production will continue
    toramp-upin this area throughout 2010 with completion of 55 wells
    from Apache and its Horn River partner’s drilling programs.
    During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition.
    Approximately $100 million of the total is for gathering,
    transportation and processing (GTP) assets.



On our other core properties, we will focus on oil projects
    located primarily in Alberta and Saskatchewan to take advantage
    of the current vast discrepancies between oil and gas prices. We
    will utilize our drilling technology and reservoir modeling
    expertise to identify and exploit unswept oil in our waterflood
    projects in the House Mountain, Leduc, and Snipe Lake fields.
    Additional drilling for oil will continue on our enhanced oil
    recovery (EOR) projects in Midale, Zama and Provost with
    long-term plans to develop and expand
    CO2projects. We will continue intermediate-depth gas development
    drilling in Kaybob and West 5 areas and in Nevis for shallow
    coal bed methane (CBM) gas. In addition, pursuant to our
    December 2009 farm-in agreement with Corridor, Apache will
    commence an appraisal program in New Brunswick in 2010.





MarketingOur Canadian natural gas marketing
    activities focus on sales to LDCs, utilities, end-users,
    integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators and
    marketers. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is
    intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk in our
    portfolio. Improved North American natural gas pipeline
    connectivity led to a closer correlation between Canadian and
    U.S. natural gas prices. To diversify our market exposure,
    we transport natural gas via our firm transportation contracts
    to California, the Chicago area and eastern Canada. We sell the
    majority of our Canadian gas on a monthly basis at eitherfirst-of-the-monthor daily prices. In 2009 approximately two percent of our gas
    sales were subject to long-term fixed-price contracts, with the
    latest expiration in 2011.



Our Canadian crude is sold primarily to integrated major oil
    companies and marketers. We sell our oil based on West Texas
    Intermediate and our NGLs based on postings, both of which are
    market-reflective prices, adjusted for quality, transportation
    and a negotiated differential. We maximize the value of our
    condensate and heavier crudes by determining whether to blend
    the condensate into our own crude production or sell it in the
    market as a segregated product. We transport crude oil on 12
    pipelines to the major trading hubs within Alberta and
    Saskatchewan, which enables us to achieve a higher netback for
    the production and to diversify our purchasers.



Egypt



OverviewEgypt holds our largest acreage
    position, with more than 11 million gross acres in 21
    separate concessions (18 producing) that provide us considerable
    exploration and development opportunities. In addition to being
    the largest acreage holder in Egypt’s Western Desert, we
    believe that Apache is also the largest producer of liquid
    hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western Desert and the third
    largest in all of Egypt. In 2009 our Egypt region contributed
    30 percent of Apache’s production revenue,
    26 percent of total production and 13 percent of total
    estimated proved reserves. The Company reports all estimated
    proved reserves held under production sharing agreements
    utilizing the economic interest method, which excludes the host
    country’s share of reserves. In 2009 Apache had an active
    drilling program in Egypt, drilling 164 wells, including
    nine new field discoveries, and conducted 792 workovers and
    recompletions. Historically, our growth in Egypt has been driven
    primarily by exploration and development of internally-generated
    prospects; in 2009 we were the most active driller in Egypt.



In the Khalda concession in 2009, we continued to monetize our
    Qasr gas discovery through completion of two additional Salam
    gas processing facilities, trains three and four, and an
    associated pipeline compression project on the Western Desert
    Northern Gas Pipeline. These facility expansions increased flow
    rates from our Qasr field discovery to600 MMcf/dand increased total net production in Egypt by100 MMcf/dand 5,000 b/d.



In Egypt, our operations are conducted pursuant to
    production-sharing contracts under which the contractor partner
    pays all operating and capital expenditure costs for exploration
    and development. A percentage of the production, usually up to
    40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
    recover operating and capital expenditure costs. In general, the
    balance of the production is allocated between the contractor
    partners and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a
    contractually defined basis. Development leases within
    concessions generally have a25-yearlife, with extensions possible for additional commercial
    discoveries or on a negotiated basis.



During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.0 billion to $1.1 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition.
    Approximately $150 million of the total is for GTP assets.



MarketingOur gas production is sold to EGPC
    primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale
    based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMbtu
    and a maximum of $2.65 per MMbtu, which corresponds to a Dated
    Brent price of $21.00 per barrel. Generally, this
    industry-pricing formula applies to all new gas discovered and
    produced. In exchange for extension of the Khalda Concession
    lease in July 2004, Apache agreed to accept the industry-pricing
    formula on a majority of gas sold but retained the previous
    gas-price formula (without a price cap) until 2013 for up to100 MMcf/dgross. This region averaged $3.70 per Mcf in 2009.



Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession and other
    nearby Western Desert blocks is sold to EGPC when called upon to
    supply domestic demandand/orto
    third parties primarily in the Mediterranean market. Oil sales
    are made either directly into the Egyptian oil pipeline grid,
    sold to non-governmental third parties





including the Middle East Oil Refinery located in northern
    Egypt, or exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the
    northern coast of Egypt. Oil production that is presently sold
    to EGPC is sold on a spot basis priced at Brent with a monthly
    EGPC official differential applied. In 2009 we sold 47 cargoes
    (approximately 14.7 million barrels) of Western Desert
    crude oil into the export market from the El Hamra terminal
    located on the northern coast of Egypt. These export cargoes
    were sold to third parties at market prices above our domestic
    prices received from EGPC. Additionally, Apache sold Qarun
    quality oil (approximately 8.5 MMbbls) at the Sidi Kerir
    terminal, also located on the northern coast of Egypt. This
    Qarun oil was sold at prevailing market prices into the domestic
    market to non-governmental purchasers (1.7 MMbbls) or
    exported primarily to refiners in the Mediterranean region (14
    cargoes for approximately 6.8 MMbbls). While we anticipate
    that an increasing amount of our oil will be sold to meet
    domestic demand during 2010, we still expect some level of sales
    to the export market.



Australia



OverviewIn Australia our exploration activity
    is focused in the offshore Carnarvon, Gippsland and Browse
    Basins, where Apache holds 4.3 million net acres in 31
    exploration permits, 14 production licenses and three retention
    leases. We also have one production license and two retention
    leases pending confirmation. Production operations are
    concentrated in the Carnarvon and Exmouth Basins. In 2009 the
    region increased equivalent production 40 percent and
    accounted for approximately seven percent of our total
    production. Australia held 13 percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves. During the year the region
    participated in drilling 33 wells, which generated 28
    productive wells.



During 2009 the Australia region restored operations and
    increased capacity at our Varanus Island gas processing
    facility, and continued to lay the foundation for future growth
    by developing previously discovered fields that will come online
    over the short, intermediate and long terms.



Our growth strategy includes short-term, medium-term and
    long-term projects from the Carnarvon Basin off the North West
    shelf of Australia. Both Van Gogh and Pyrenees (two large oil
    development projects in the Exmouthsub-basin)commenced production in the first quarter of 2010. In the
    intermediate-term, growth in Australia will result from the
    development of both Apache’s 2008 Halyard discovery and our
    Reindeer discovery. Both Halyard and Reindeer are
    gas-development projects that are scheduled to initiate
    production in 2011. Long-term growth will come from the
    Company’s Julimar, Macedon and Coniston discoveries.



Growth Drivers 2010Van Gogh is
    Apache-operated, while Pyrenees is operated by BHP Billiton. Van
    Gogh development drilling and installation of sub sea production
    equipment was completed in mid-2009, and limited production
    commenced in mid-February 2010. Van Gogh oil is produced and
    stored in the Ningaloo Vision floating, production, storage and
    offloading (FPSO) vessel, which is still performing normal
    commissioning activities.



Pyrenees development continued with the drilling and completion
    of initial wells and installation of subsea facilities in 2009.
    First oil production commenced ahead of schedule, on
    February 24, 2010. As planned, the wells will be drilled
    and brought on in phases, with half of the expected production
    volume ramping up over the next six months.



Peak production from the Van Gogh and Pyrenees discoveries is
    projected to reach a combined 40,000 b/d net to Apache.



During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion for drilling,
    recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades,
    production enhancement projects and seismic acquisition.
    Approximately $350 million of the total is for development
    and processing facilities.



Growth Drivers 2011In April 2008 we drilled
    the Halyard-1 discovery well, which tested68 MMcf/d.Current plans call for the field to be tied into the nearby East
    Spar gas facilities, with first production anticipated in 2011.



Construction and fabrication work has resumed and official
    groundbreaking at the Devil Creek site of the onshore gas plant
    was on September 15, 2009, following completion of a gas
    sales contract with CITIC Pacific’s Sino Iron project in
    Western Australia. This plant and gas sales contract will enable
    us to monetize a portion of our





Reindeer gas discovery. Under terms of the agreement, Apache and
    its joint venture partner have agreed to supply 154 Bcf of
    gas over seven years (approximately60 MMcf/d)beginning in the second half of 2011 at prices substantially
    above Apache’s current average realizations. Apache owns a
    55-percent interest in the field. The Company is continuing to
    market its remaining net share in the Reindeer field.



Growth Drivers — Long-TermApache
    has agreed to participate in an LNG development project
    (discussed below) that will enable Apache to develop and
    monetize its share of the Julimar and Brunello natural gas
    discoveries, opening up new markets for these reserves.
    Apache’s projected net sales are190 MMcf/dand 5,100 b/d with a projected15-yearproduction plateau when the multi-year project is fully
    operational. The project, which is currently in FEED, will
    convert the gas into LNG for sale on the world market. World LNG
    prices are typically tied to oil prices and are currently higher
    than the historical gas prices in Western Australia.



In October 2009 we announced Apache’s 16.25 percent
    participation with Chevron in the Wheatstone LNG project. The
    Wheatstone project is targeting a FID in 2011, with first LNG
    projected in 2015. Apache operates the Julimar and Brunello
    fields, while Chevron will operate both the Wheatstone field and
    the LNG facilities. Our net capital investment in the project is
    currently estimated to be $1.2 billion for upstream
    development of the Julimar and Brunello fields and
    $3.0 billion in the Wheatstone facilities.



We have two contingent development opportunities tied to our
    recent Pyrenees and Van Gogh projects that will be evaluated
    during 2010. Macedon field is a gas discovery near the Pyrenees
    field that is currently under review by the operator, BHP
    Billiton, for commercial development. Gas produced from Pyrenees
    will be reinjected into Macedon field to reduce flaring and to
    conserve those volumes for future sale. Coniston field is an oil
    accumulation near our Van Gogh field. Apache has drilled 10
    appraisal wells during 2009 and is evaluating a development plan
    to tie back the field to the FPSO Ningaloo Vision currently
    serving the Van Gogh field.



MarketingAs of December 31, 2009, Apache
    had a total of 18 active gas contracts in Australia with
    expiration dates ranging from March 2010 to July 2030.
    Historically, natural gas sold in Western Australia was under
    long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain price
    escalation clauses based on the Australian consumer price index.
    The contract in place for the Reindeer field contains prices
    substantially higher than we currently receive in Australia. The
    LNG from our Julimar discovery is anticipated to be sold at
    prices tied to oil and sold into international markets.



Apache continues to directly market all of its crude oil
    production into Australian domestic and international markets at
    prices generally indexed to Dated Brent or Tapis benchmarks,
    which typically track at or above NYMEX oil prices.



North
    Sea



OverviewApache entered the North Sea in 2003
    upon acquiring an approximate 97-percent working interest in the
    Forties field (Forties). Production for 2009 increased two
    percent compared to 2008 as gains from our topsides renovation
    program and our drilling and workover programs more than offset
    downtime to replace an original vintage spool section at the end
    of the Bravo-Charlie infield pipeline, which lowered production
    for the year by 2,690 boe/d.



In addition to an active year of drilling, we completed and made
    significant progress on several important facility projects that
    will benefit Forties in the years ahead. The Delta-Charlie
    infield pipeline was replaced, bringing improved mechanical
    integrity. We installed and commissioned a new power turbine on
    Delta to support increasing field-water injection during 2010.
    On the Charlie platform, we purchased equipment, cleared access
    and began installing components late in 2009 for a new
    high-pressure gas lift system that will be operational in early
    2011. Work that began on the Echo platform several years ago to
    replace the antiquated and unreliable controls system with a
    modern version was fundamentally completed. The various facility
    upgrade and improvement projects completed in recent years
    resulted in a significant reduction in the number of occurrences
    of unplanned downtime. In 2009 we had fewer events causing
    unplanned downtime than we have experienced in any year since
    acquiring the Forties field; 64 percent less than our previous
    best year.





In 2009 the North Sea region produced 22.4 MMboe
    (99 percent oil), approximately 11 percent of our
    total worldwide production, generating almost $1.4 billion
    of revenue and held approximately seven percent of our year-end
    estimated proved reserves. Our capital investments in the North
    Sea region during 2009 totaled $354 million.



During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $625 million to $675 million with significant capital
    devoted to drilling and improving facilities within Forties. We
    will also shoot a3-Dseismic
    survey over Forties to refresh our four-dimensional imaging of
    bypassed oil accumulations. In 2010 we expect to drill at least
    one exploration well and one appraisal well in waters outside
    Forties.



MarketingIn 2009 we sold our Forties crude
    under both term contracts and spot cargoes. The term sales are
    composed of base-market indices, adjusted for the quality
    difference between the Forties crude and Brent, with a premium
    to reflect the higher market value for term arrangements. The
    value received for spot cargoes, generally about
    600,000 barrels each, were at or above prevailing market
    prices. Apache sold 12 spot cargoes in 2009.



Argentina



OverviewWe have had a continuous presence in
    Argentina since 2001, which was expanded substantially by two
    acquisitions in 2006. We currently have operations in the
    Provinces of Neuquén, Rio Negro and Tierra del Fuego. We
    have interests in 24 concessions covering over 3.1 million
    gross acres (2.8 million net), with varying expiration
    dates, but generally greater than 10 years remaining subject to
    additional extensions.



Natural gas price realizations in Argentina continued their
    upward trend in 2009. Our 2009 realized prices were $1.96 per
    Mcf, a 22 percent increase over our 2008 averaged realized
    price of $1.61 per Mcf and a 68 percent increase over the
    $1.17 per Mcf realized in 2007.



During 2009 Apache received technical and commercial approval
    from the government of Argentina for four Gas Plus projects and
    technical approval for two more Gas Plus projects designed to
    encourage new supplies through development of tight sands and
    unconventional gas reserves. Under the Gas Plus program, Apache
    has the opportunity to supply10 MMcf/dfrom fields in the Neuquén Province at a price of $4.10 per
    MMBtu beginning January 2010 for an initial one-year term. The
    Company also has signed a letter of intent for a contract to
    supply up to50 MMcf/dfrom fields in the Neuquén and Rio Negro Provinces for
    $5.00 per MMBtu beginning January 2011. The gas supplying the
    Gas Plus program contracts is required to come from wells
    drilled in the projects’ approved fields and formations. We
    believe this type of program, coupled with changing market
    conditions, points to improving price realizations going forward.



In December 2008 the Mendoza Province granted Apache an
    exploration permit for CCyB Block 17B in the Cuyo Basin,
    which increased our Argentine acreage by 34 percent. Apache
    is currently awaiting Mendoza Province’s approval for the
    extension of CCyB Block 17A, which is anticipated in the
    first half of 2010. Together the two Mendoza Province blocks
    comprise about 1.2 million acres. Approximately
    505 square kilometers of3-Dseismic
    is scheduled to be acquired in 2010 using new cable-less
    technology, the first time this technology has been used in
    Argentina. A drilling campaign in the Cuyo Basin is also
    scheduled to commence in mid-2010. With the addition of the
    Mendoza acreage, Apache will hold oil and gas assets in three of
    the main Argentine hydrocarbon basins: Neuquén, Austral and
    Cuyo.



In March 2009 the Province of Neuquén and Apache reached
    agreement to extend eight federal oil and gas concessions for 10
    additional years. The concessions, which were scheduled to
    expire between 2015 and 2017, encompass approximately
    590,000 net acres, including exploratory areas totaling
    514,000 net acres. Neuquén operations generate about
    half of Apache’s total output in Argentina.



Activity during 2009 on our Tierra del Fuego assets included
    nine discoveries, several facility projects and a fracture
    stimulation campaign involving 10 wells. Future investment
    by Apache in the Tierra del Fuego Province will be significantly
    influenced by the probability of obtaining the Province’s
    agreement to an extension of the present concession deadlines,
    which are scheduled to expire in 2016 and 2017.



In 2009 our Argentina region produced 16.6 MMboe, drilled
    29.6 net wells (32 gross) and performed 57 additional
    capital projects. These programs added an estimated
    14.4 MMboe in reserves and bring our reserves in Argentina
    to an estimated 119.0 MMboe at December 31, 2009, or
    five percent of our estimated worldwide total.





During 2010 the region plans to invest approximately
    $250 million for drilling, recompletion projects,
    development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement
    projects and seismic acquisition.



MarketingWe receive government-regulated
    pricing on a substantial portion of our production. The volumes
    we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the
    government and vary with seasonal factors and industry category.
    During 2009 we realized an average price of $1.07 per Mcf on
    government-regulated sales. The majority of the remaining
    volumes were sold at market-driven prices, which averaged $2.65
    per Mcf in 2009. Our overall average realized price for 2009 was
    $1.96 per Mcf, 22 percent higher than 2008 average realized
    prices ($1.61 per Mcf) and 68 percent higher than 2007
    average realized prices ($1.17 per Mcf).



Taxes on exported oil effectively limit the prices buyers are
    willing to pay for domestic sales. Domestic oil prices are
    currently based on $42 per barrel, plus quality adjustments and
    local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or
    decrease as market prices deviate from the base price. In Tierra
    del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist, however, Apache
    retains the value-added tax collected from buyers, effectively
    increasing realized prices by 21 percent. As a result, 2009
    oil prices realized from our Neuquén Basin production
    averaged $44.09 per barrel, compared to $54.43 per barrel from
    our Tierra del Fuego oil production.



Apache realized an additional $6 million of oil revenues in
    2009 from benefits generated by the government’s Oil Plus
    Program. This program rewarded participants that increased oil
    production and reserves during 2008 and 2009. A further
    $2 million of benefit was realized in January 2010.



Chile



In November 2007 Apache was awarded exploration rights on two
    blocks comprising approximately one million net acres on the
    Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego. This acreage is adjacent to
    our 552,000 net acres on the Argentine side of the island
    of Tierra del Fuego and represents a natural extension of our
    expanding exploration and production operations. The Lenga and
    Rusfin Blocks were ratified by the Chilean government on
    July 24, 2008. In January 2009 a3-Dseismic
    survey totaling 1,000 square kilometers was completed, and
    in November 2009 the first of a three-well exploration program
    commenced drilling. Two of the wells reached total depth by
    year-end 2009, with drilling completed on the third well in
    early 2010. Currently a completion rig is conducting testing and
    completion efforts on the three wells. During 2010 we plan to
    invest approximately $25 million to $35 million for
    drilling and seismic acquisition.



Major
    Customers



In 2009 purchases by Shell accounted for 18 percent of the
    Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues.



Subsequent
    Events



Kitimat
    LNG Terminal



On January 13, 2010, Apache announced that its Apache
    Canada Ltd. subsidiary has agreed to acquire 51 percent of
    Kitimat LNG Inc.’s proposed LNG export terminal in British
    Columbia. Apache also reserved 51 percent of gas throughput
    capacity in the terminal.



The proposed Kitimat project, located at Bish Cove near the Port
    of Kitimat about 405 miles north of Vancouver, has planned
    capacity of about700 MMcf/d,or five million metric tons of LNG per year. Preliminary gross
    construction cost estimates of C$3 billion will be refined
    at the conclusion of FEED. The project is projected to employ an
    estimated 1,500 people during construction and 100 on a
    permanent basis.



Kitimat is designed to be linked to the pipeline system
    servicing Western Canada’s natural gas producing regions
    via the proposed Pacific Trail Pipelines, a C$1.1 billion
    project. In association with our acquisition of interest in the
    Kitimat project, we also acquired a 25.5-percent interest in the
    proposed pipeline and 350 MMcf/d of capacity rights.



    Performance Program



To provide long-term incentives for Apache employees to deliver
    competitive returns to our stockholders, in January 2010 the
    Company’s Board of Directors approved the 2010 Performance
    Program, pursuant to the 2007





Omnibus Equity Compensation Plan. Eligible employees received an
    initial conditional restricted stock unit award of
    541,440 units, with the ultimate number of restricted stock
    units to be awarded, if any, based upon measurement of total
    shareholder return of Apache common stock as compared to a
    designated peer group during a three-year performance period.
    Should any restricted stock units be awarded at the end of the
    three-year performance period, 50 percent of restricted
    stock units awarded will immediately vest, and an additional
    25 percent will vest on succeeding anniversaries of the end
    of the performance period. The Company’s Board of Directors
    also approved a one-time restricted stock unit award of
    502,470 shares to eligible Apache employees, with one-third
    of the units granted immediately vesting and an additional
    one-third vesting on each of the first and second anniversaries
    of the grant date.



Drilling
    Statistics



Worldwide in 2009 we participated in drilling 610 gross
    wells, with 558 (91 percent) completed as producers. We
    also performed nearly 2,100 workovers and recompletions during
    the year. Historically, our drilling activities in the
    U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and
    extension of existing, producing fields rather than exploration.
    As a general matter, our operations outside of the
    U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and exploitation wells.
    In addition to our completed wells, at year-end several wells
    had not yet reached completion: 12 in the U.S. (8.1 net); 5
    in Canada (3.6 net); 14 in Egypt (13.0 net); 9 in Australia (3.1
    net); 2 in the North Sea (1.9 net); and 2 in Argentina (2 net).

As of December 31, 2009, we had 2,948,251, 2,941,882 and
    928,515 net acres scheduled to expire by December 31,
    2010, 2011 and 2012, respectively, if production is not
    established or we take no other action to extend the terms. We
    plan to continue the terms of many of these licenses and
    concession areas through operational or administrative actions
    and do not expect a significant portion of our net acreage
    position to expire before such actions occur.



As of December 31, 2009, 78 percent of U.S. net
    undeveloped acreage and 44 percent of Canadian undeveloped
    acreage was held by production.



Estimated
    Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows



In January 2009 the SEC issued ReleaseNo. 33-8995,“Modernization of Oil and Gas Reporting” (Release33-8995),amending oil and gas reporting requirements underRule 4-10ofRegulation S-Xand Industry Guide 2 inRegulation S-Kand bringing full-cost accounting rules into alignment with the
    revised disclosure requirements. The new rules include changes
    to the pricing used to estimate reserves, the option to disclose
    probable and possible reserves, revised definitions for proved
    reserves, additional disclosures with respect to undeveloped
    reserves, and other new or revised definitions and disclosures.
    In January 2010 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
    issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)No. 2010-03,“Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and Disclosures”
    (ASU2010-03),which amends Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 932,
    “Extractive Industries — Oil and Gas” to
    align the guidance with the changes made by the SEC. The Company
    adopted Release33-8995and
    the amendments to ASC Topic 932 resulting from ASU2010-03(collectively, the Modernization Rules) effective
    December 31, 2009.





Proved undeveloped (PUD) reserves include those reserves that
    are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled
    acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major
    expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves
    may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage
    directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably
    certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology
    provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility.
    Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped
    reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating
    that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless
    specific circumstances justify a longer time period.





The following table shows proved oil, NGL and gas reserves as of
    December 31, 2009, based on average commodity prices in
    effect on the first day of each month in 2009, held flat for the
    life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales
    are covered by physical contract terms.

As of December 31, 2009, Apache had total estimated proved
    reserves of 1,067 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate and NGLs
    and 7.8 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated
    proved reserves are the energy equivalent of 2.4 billion
    barrels of oil or 14.2 Tcf of natural gas. As of
    December 31, 2009, the Company’s proved developed
    reserves totaled 1,636 MMboe, and estimated PUD reserves
    totaled 731 MMboe, or approximately 31 percent of
    worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to
    disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.



The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved
    developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves as of
    December 31, 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006, changes in
    estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and
    estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are
    contained in Note 13 — Supplemental Oil and Gas
    Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
    set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of thisForm 10-K.Estimated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2009,
    were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per
    annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average
    of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in
    2009, held flat for the life of the production, except where
    prices are defined by contractual arrangements. Future net cash
    flows as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, were estimated
    using commodity prices in effect at the end of those years, in
    accordance with the SEC guidelines in effect prior to the
    issuance of the Modernization Rules.



Proved
    Undeveloped Reserves



The Company’s total estimated proved undeveloped reserves
    of 731 MMboe as of December 31, 2009, increased by
    54 MMboe over the 677 MMboe of PUD reserves estimated
    at the end of 2008. During the year, Apache converted
    39 MMboe of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed
    reserves through development drilling activity. In North America
    we converted 22 MMboe with the remaining 17 MMboe in
    our international areas.



During the year a total of $760 million was spent on
    projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD
    reserves at the end of 2008. Not all of those expenditures
    resulted in a conversion from proved undeveloped to proved
    developed reserves during the year. We spent $264 million
    on PUD reserve development activity in North America and
    $496 million in the international areas, including
    $230 million in Australia where the reserves for those
    projects will be converted to developed in future years.





Preparation
    of Oil and Gas Reserve Information



Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are reasonably
    certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to
    revision. As additional geoscience, engineering and economic
    data are obtained, proved reserve estimates are much more likely
    to increase or remain constant than to decrease. These estimates
    are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or
    downward, as warranted.



Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property
    level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
    of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the
    operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and
    geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas
    and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
    necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net
    revenues and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is
    compiled in a computer database application, to which only
    authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent
    with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed
    internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s
    Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis.
    Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our centralized
    and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating
    expenses, netback prices, production trends and development
    timing are reasonable.



Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir
    Engineering, W. Kregg Olson, is the person primarily responsible
    for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates
    and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a
    third-party engineering firm. Mr. Olson is a graduate of
    Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Science degree in
    Petroleum Engineering. He has over 29 years of industry
    experience, with the last 25 years focused on reservoir
    engineering. He is a member of the Society of Petroleum
    Engineers and is a Registered Professional Engineer in the state
    of Oklahoma. Mr. Olson has held positions of increasing
    responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir
    engineering department since joining the company in 1992.



The estimate of reserves disclosed in this annual report onForm 10-Kis prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the
    Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those
    estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company,
    L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes
    and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon
    liquid and gas reserves. Apache selects the properties for
    review by Ryder Scott. These properties represented all material
    fields, and over 85 percent of international properties and
    new wells drilled during the year. During 2009, 2008, and 2007,
    Ryder Scott’s review covered 79, 82 and 77 percent of
    the Company’s worldwide estimated reserves value,
    respectively. We have filed Ryder Scott’s independent
    report as an exhibit to thisForm 10-K.

    by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty,
    or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to
    such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may
    additionally be subject to obligations or duties under
    applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
    arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests
    may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net
    profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and
    current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases,
    and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of
    which detract substantially from the value of the interests or
    materially interfere with their use in our operations.
