General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. We currently have
exploration and production interests in six countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, Australia, the U.K. North Sea (North Sea), and Argentina. Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable
discoveries and development opportunities. We treat all operations as one line of business.

Properties to which we refer in this document may be held by subsidiaries of Apache Corporation. References to
“Apache” or the “Company” include Apache Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise specifically stated.

Growth Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a
profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, which are centered on the following core
strategic components:



•balanced portfolio of core assets



•conservative capital structure



•rate of return focus






Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have underpinned our
ability to deliver long-term production and reserve growth and achieve competitive returns on invested capital for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased reserves 23 out of the last 27 years and production 32 out of the past 34 years, a
testament to our consistency over the long-term.

Apache pursues opportunities for growth through exploration
and development drilling, supplemented by occasional strategic acquisitions. After a three-year period of significant portfolio expansion through acquisitions, we have shifted our focus back to developing our enlarged property base. In 2012, we
generated approximately $8.5 billion of cash flows from operating activities, which enabled us to have an active drilling and development program across all of our regions. As a result, we reported record production of 779 Mboe/d, up over four
percent from the prior year. At the same time, we have also invested a larger portion of our capital budget on long-lead time projects than we have in the past. In 2012, we spent approximately one-quarter of our capital budget on purchasing
additional leasehold acreage, obtaining seismic data, building infrastructure, and proceeding on long-lead development projects including LNG facilities. Coupled with an active drilling program and our new venture exploration efforts, these
longer-term investments secure a platform for future profitable growth.

While we are focused on growth
through the drill bit, we also seek acquisition opportunities that meet our criteria for risk, reward, rate of return, and growth potential. From April 2010 through the end of 2012, Apache announced several significant acquisitions, each of which
fit well with our long-term growth strategy. These properties are strategically positioned with our existing infrastructure and play to the strengths that come with our operating experience. Our significant acquisitions and other transactions since
2010 are described below.

North America

Apache’s North American asset base primarily comprises operations in the central U.S., the Permian Basin, the Gulf
Coast onshore and offshore areas of the U.S., and operations in Western Canada. In 2012, our North America assets contributed 56 percent of our production and 45 percent of our oil and gas production revenues. At year-end 2012, 69 percent of
our estimated proved reserves were located in North America.

United States

OverviewWe have 12.3 million gross acres across the U.S., approximately 60 percent of
which is undeveloped. After expanding our portfolio over the last three years, we now hold leading positions in many attractive basins and plays within the United States. To focus our development efforts in the U.S., we have divided our assets into
five distinct regions: Central, Permian, Gulf of Mexico Shelf, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf Coast Onshore. We also have leasehold acreage holdings in Alaska and other states where we are






pursuing exploration opportunities. Our holdings in the U.S. provide a balance of hydrocarbon mix and reserve life and an opportunity for continued exploration. In 2012, 54 percent of our U.S.
production and 63 percent of our U.S. year-end estimated proved reserves were oil and liquids. In addition, the reserve life of our U.S. regions ranged from 6 to 20 years with the Gulf of Mexico offshore region’s shorter-lived reserves
balancing longer-lived reserves in the Central and Permian regions. In 2012, 40 percent of Apache’s equivalent production and 50 percent of Apache’s total year-end estimated proved reserves were in the U.S.

Central RegionThe Central region includes more than 3,500 producing wells primarily in
western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle and controls nearly 1.9 million gross acres. The region is Apache’s first core area dating back over half a century and has historically grown through low-risk, highly predictable natural gas
exploitation. Over the last three years, however, a transformation from vertical to horizontal drilling and continued price disparity between crude oil and natural gas have evolved the region from one targeting natural gas to one now targeting oil
and liquids-rich gas plays. This focus resulted in liquids production growth of over 115 percent during 2011. Oil and liquids production further expanded during 2012, with oil production more than doubling and NGL production almost tripling compared
to the prior year. Total region production was up 37 percent in 2012. The Central region contributed 8 percent of Apache’s 2012 equivalent production and 9 percent of total year-end proved reserves.

The primary driver of the region’s growth was an active exploration and development program where we drilled or
participated in drilling 192 wells during 2012, 99 percent of which were completed as producers. A significant focus of our drilling program has been in the Anadarko basin’s Granite Wash play. The Granite Wash consists of a series of thick,
multi-layered formations of low-permeability and liquids-rich sandstones. The Company’s significant acreage position in the play has generated an active drilling plan for the next several years across numerous formations, notably the Tonkawa,
Marmaton, Cottage Grove, and Cleveland.

We have also been drilling Canyon Wash wells on approximately 92,000
net acres in the Whittenburg basin. During the year, we drilled and completed seven successful wells in the Canyon Wash, which averaged 30-day gross rates of approximately 675 b/d and 500 Mcf/d. These tests are an encouraging validation of this
play, given the results are from vertically drilled wells.

Our drilling momentum in the Central region was
further bolstered in April when the Company completed the acquisition of Cordillera, a privately held company with approximately 312,000 net acres in the heart of the Anadarko basin, nearly 18 Mboe/d of production, and estimated proved reserves of
70 MMboe. The acquisition doubled Apache’s acreage in the Granite Wash area and added a robust drilling inventory that was immediately integrated into our existing program.

The region operated an average of 18 drilling rigs during 2012 and, with a growing portfolio of drilling opportunities,
plans to run an average of 29 rigs during 2013. We expect to invest approximately $1.4 billion in 2013 for drilling, recompletions, equipment upgrades, and production enhancement projects. The region will also invest in facility and transportation
projects to increase takeaway capacity.

Permian RegionOur Permian region
controls over 3.5 million gross acres with exposure across every major play in the Permian Basin. The region’s property and acreage base has increased substantially over the last three years through an active acquisition effort. Apache is
now one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, operating more than 12,000 wells in 152 fields, including 47 waterfloods and 7 active CO2 floods, including the Roberts Unit, which initiated CO2 injection in January 2013. In 2012, liquids
production in the region was up 25 percent, contributing to a total sequential production increase of over 18 percent as a result of an active drilling program that is continuing to ramp up. We averaged running 32 rigs during the year, drilling
or participating in 781 wells, and plan to run 34 rigs in 2013. The Permian region’s year-end 2012 estimated proved reserves were 800 MMboe and represented 28 percent of Apache’s total proved reserves.

A key focus area of our activity during the year continued to be the multi-zone development of the Deadwood area.
Deadwood is the most active of our plays in the Midland basin, where we ran an average of






16 rigs and drilled 317 wells. Specifically, the region is primarily drilling vertical wells targeting the Wolfwood and the Fusselman zones. With additional 3-D seismic data recently
acquired, our ability to target other prolific accumulations and new drilling locations has been enhanced.

The region is also building a large inventory of horizontal drilling opportunities based on success achieved over 2012,
having drilled or participated in drilling 104 horizontal wells during the period. Two horizontal plays in the Midland Basin, the Wolfcamp and Cline shales, have been drilled and commercialized with multi-rig development programs moving forward.
Also in the Midland Basin, we recently drilled and completed oil-producing wells in the Barnett and Deadwood shales focusing on the future potential across our large acreage position. New horizontal plays in the Mississippian Lime and Clearfork
shales are planned for 2013. We recently commenced horizontal well programs in the Yeso area of New Mexico as well as in the Bone Spring and Wolfcamp plays in Texas. We also continue to achieve positive results in the Central basin with horizontal
redevelopment of historically conventional fields and reservoirs. We expect to conduct greater horizontal drilling into 2013, when we project that nearly half of our rigs will be drilling horizontal wells by year-end.

Our active drilling program has resulted in production growth for the past eight sequential quarters, rising 37 percent
over the past two years. Given a current inventory of over 34,000 locations, the region has a deep portfolio of drilling opportunities for multiple years. For 2013, the Permian region plans to invest approximately $2.4 billion in drilling,
recompletion projects, equipment upgrades, expansion of existing facilities and equipment, and leasing activities.

Gulf Coast RegionsOur Gulf Coast assets are primarily located in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas onshore and offshore Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.
The area is divided into three regions, which include the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf Coast Onshore.

In water depths less than 500 feet, which constitutes most of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf region, Apache is currently the largest producer and has been the largest offshore held-by-production acreage owner
since 2004, holding approximately three million gross acres. The region contributed 12 percent of our worldwide production and revenue during 2012. With prolific wells, strong cash flows, and a strategic position near the
petrochemical-industrial complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the region has consistently generated high rates of return. During 2012 the region drilled or participated in 36 wells with an 80-percent success rate, consistent with activity levels of the
prior two years. In June 2012, the region also participated in the federal lease sale where we were awarded 60 blocks, opening up additional exploration and development opportunities.

In water depths greater than 500 feet, the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region is a relatively underexplored and oil prone
area that provides exposure to significant reserve and production potential. Apache’s strategic presence in the area was gained through the 2010 Mariner merger and was extended through our participation in the June 2012 federal lease sale where
we were awarded 28 new leases. The Company now owns approximately 900,000 gross acres across 166 blocks as of the end of 2012. The Deepwater region contributed only 2 percent of Apache’s worldwide production in 2012; however, there are several
large projects and developments underway that could spur significant growth. The non-operated Lucius project, where Apache holds an 11.7-percent working interest, is currently under development with first production projected for 2014. In addition,
the large-scale non-operated Heidelberg project continues to move forward. Apache has a 12.5-percent working interest in this development with first production projected for 2016. The region also continues to increase its exploration activity. After
drilling two wells in 2011, we drilled five wells in 2012 with a 60-percent success rate. Seven wells are planned for drilling in the areas in which we hold an interest during 2013.

Apache’s Gulf Coast Onshore region includes mature onshore and near-shore basins of Texas, Louisiana, and
Mississippi, where it has a significant acreage position of approximately 1.4 million gross acres, including 330,000 mineral fee acres. With advancements in modern seismic imaging, horizontal drilling and completion technologies, additional
opportunities continue to evolve. During the year, the region focused on drilling shallow and moderate-depth targets, increasing acreage holdings, and expanding regional 3-D seismic databases. In






addition, the region continued evaluating several unconventional resource plays and deeper exploitation opportunities. The region drilled or participated in drilling 35 wells during 2012 and
plans to drill or participate in approximately 39 wells in 2013.

In 2013, Apache plans to invest
approximately $700 million, $400 million, and $250 million in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf Coast Onshore regions, respectively. The capital will be spent on drilling, recompletion and development projects, equipment
upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic and lease activities. The Company spent $435 million on abandonment activities in 2012 over the entire Gulf Coast area and expects similar activity levels in 2013.

U.S. MarketingIn general, most of our U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market
prices. Our natural gas is sold primarily to local distribution companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, and integrated major oil companies. We maintain a diverse customer portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk.

Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation
companies, and refiners. Our objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that
renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices.

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the
purchaser.

Canada

OverviewSince entering the Canadian market in 1995,Apache has continued to increase its presence in the region and now holds approximately seven
million gross acres across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. The region’s large acreage position provides portfolio diversification as well as significant drilling opportunity. Canada represented approximately 19
percent of Apache’s worldwide proved reserves at year-end 2012 and approximately 16 percent of 2012 worldwide production.

In 2012, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 169 wells in Canada, with a continued focus on increasing oil and liquids-rich gas production. Reservoir modeling and state-of-the-art horizontal
drilling technology advanced several oil plays in the Viking, Glauconite, Dunvegan, and Sparky formations, and success with multi-stage fracture completions continues to increase the scope of oil and liquids-rich gas drilling opportunities.

Future natural gas drilling activity will be driven by market prices and the Kitimat LNG project. In December
2012, Apache announced an agreement with Chevron Canada to build and operate the Kitimat LNG project and develop shale gas resources at the Liard and Horn River basins in British Columbia. Chevron Canada and Apache Canada will each hold a 50-percent
interest in the Kitimat LNG plant, the Pacific Trail Pipeline, and approximately 644,000 gross undeveloped acres in the Horn River and Liard basins. Chevron Canada will operate the LNG plant and pipeline, and Apache Canada will operate Horn River
and Liard. The Kitimat plant has received all significant environmental approvals and a 20-year export license from the Canadian federal government. Although the project has not reached a final investment decision, we believe Chevron’s
experience in developing LNG projects and marketing expertise will assist in moving the development forward. The transaction was completed on February 8, 2013.

In 2013, the region plans to invest approximately $680 million in drilling and development projects, equipment upgrades,
production enhancement projects, seismic acquisition, and Kitimat project development. Drilling in 2013 will continue to focus on conventional oil and liquids-rich gas plays.






MarketingOur Canadian natural gas marketing
activities focus on sales to utilities, end-users, integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators, and marketers. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk in our portfolio. To diversify
our market exposure, we transport natural gas via firm transportation contracts to export border points for delivery into Washington, California, and the Chicago area. We sell the majority of our Canadian gas on a monthly basis at either
first-of-the-month or daily AECO index prices.

Canadian crude oil production is sold to integrated major
companies, refiners, and marketing companies based on a WTI price, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective negotiated differential. We maximize the value of our condensate and heavier crudes by determining whether to blend the
condensate into our own crude production or sell it in the market as a segregated product. The crude is transported on pipeline or truck within Western Canada to the market hubs in Alberta and Manitoba where it is sold, allowing for a more
diversified group of purchasers and a higher netback price.

The region’s NGL production is sold under
contracts with prices based on market indices, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

International

Apache’s international assets
are located in Egypt, Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North Sea, and Argentina. In 2012, international assets contributed 44 percent of our production and 55 percent of our oil and gas revenues. At year-end 2012, 31 percent of our estimated
proved reserves were located outside North America.

Egypt

OverviewOur activity in Egypt began in 1994 with our first Qarun discovery
well. Today we control 9.7 million gross acres, making Apache the largest acreage holder in Egypt’s Western Desert. Only 18 percent of our gross acreage in Egypt has been developed, with gross production of 213 Mb/d and 900
MMcf/d in 2012, or 100 Mb/d and 354 MMcf/d net to Apache. The remaining 82 percent of our acreage is undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future. In 2012, the region contributed
27 percent of Apache’s worldwide production revenue, 20 percent of our worldwide production, and 10 percent of our year-end 2012 estimated proved reserves. Our estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest
method and exclude the host country share reserves.

Our operations in Egypt are conducted pursuant to
production-sharing agreements in 23 separate concessions, under which the contractor partner pays all operating and capital expenditure costs for exploration and development. Development leases within concessions generally have a 25-year life, with
extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis, and currently have expiration dates ranging from five to 25 years. A percentage of the production on development leases, usually up to 40 percent, is available to
the contractor partners to recover operating and capital expenditure costs, with the balance generally allocated between the contractor partners and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis.

Historically, growth in Egypt has been driven by an ongoing drilling program, and we are one of the most active drillers
in the region. Throughout 2012, we averaged running 25 rigs and drilled 188 development and injection wells and 51 exploration wells. Approximately 55 percent of our exploration wells were successful, further expanding our presence in the
westernmost concessions and unlocking additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the region’s success has been our ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable the region’s technical teams to
consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic reservoirs.






Heading into 2013, the region will continue an active drilling program and
plans to invest approximately $1.1 billion for drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, and seismic acquisition. There are also several key infrastructure projects underway that will focus on maintaining gas deliverability and bringing
additional liquids to market.

MarketingOur gas production is sold to EGPC
primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content. Apache previously agreed to accept the
industry-pricing formula on a majority of gas sold but retained the previous gas-price formula (without an oil price cap) until the end of 2012 for up to 100 MMcf/d gross. The region averaged $3.90 per Mcf in 2012.

Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession, and other nearby Western Desert blocks is sold to third parties in
the Mediterranean market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil sales are exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production that is presently sold to EGPC is sold on a spot basis
priced at Brent with a monthly EGPC official differential applied.

Egypt political
unrestIn February 2011, former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped down, and the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took power, announcing that it would remain in power until the presidential and
parliamentary elections could be held. In June 2012, Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party was elected as Egypt’s new president. In December 2012 the people of Egypt ratified a new constitution. Under the new
constitution, the government must hold elections for the lower house of parliament within 60 days. Apache’s operations, located in remote locations in the Western Desert, have not experienced production interruptions, and we have continued to
receive development lease approvals for our drilling program. However, a deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export
restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment
Corporation (OPIC) and other highly rated international insurers covering a portion of its investments in Egypt. In the aggregate, these insurance policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to
Apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $263 million sub-limit for currency inconvertibility.

In addition, the Company has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $300 million of coverage for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral awards covering amounts owed Apache on
past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum in the event that actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production. In October 2012, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
(MIGA), a member of the World Bank Group, announced that it was providing $150 million in reinsurance to OPIC for the remainder of the policy term. This provision of long-term reinsurance to OPIC will allow Apache to maintain the $300 million of
insurance coverage through 2024.

Australia

OverviewApache’s holdings in Australia are focused offshore Western
Australia in the Carnarvon, Exmouth, and Browse basins. We have operated in the Carnarvon basin since acquiring the gas processing facilities on Varanus Island and adjacent producing properties in 1993. Production operations are located in the
Carnarvon and Exmouth basins. In total, we control approximately 7.9 million gross acres offshore Western Australia through 30 exploration permits, 17 production licenses, and 13 retention leases. Approximately 90 percent of our acreage is
undeveloped, and the region continues to actively pursue additional acreage opportunities.






During 2012, the region had net production of 29 Mb/d of oil and 214 MMcf/d
of natural gas, contributing 9 percent of Apache’s worldwide production revenue, 8 percent of worldwide production and 12 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves. Production compared to the prior year was 7 percent lower primarily as
a result of natural decline in the Pyrenees and Van Gogh oil fields. Offsetting production declines was a full year of production from the Reindeer field. This gas is processed through the Devil Creek Gas Plant, which came online in December 2011.
This plant is Western Australia’s third domestic natural gas processing hub and the first new hub to be constructed in more than 15 years. Gas from the development has been sold to a number of customers in Western Australia’s growing
mining and minerals processing sectors at prices significantly higher than prior year realizations.

The
region is a key component of Apache’s exploration program. During 2012, we participated in drilling 15 offshore wells, of which 10 were exploration or appraisal wells. This compares to nine wells drilled in 2011. Over the past decade, the
region’s exploration activity has established a significant pipeline of projects that are expected to contribute to production growth as they are brought onstream in the coming years.

First production is projected in 2013 from four completed gas wells in the Macedon gas field. Gas will be delivered via a
60-mile pipeline to a 200 MMcf/d gas plant being built at Ashburton North in Western Australia. Apache has successfully marketed nearly all of its proved reserves in the Macedon field under long-term contracts at prices significantly higher than
current realizations. We have a 29-percent non-operating working interest in the field and gas plant.

Development of the Coniston oil field project, which lies just north of the Van Gogh field, continued toward projected
first production in 2014. The field will be produced via subsea completions tied back to the Floating Production Storage and Offloading Vessel (FPSO) at Van Gogh. To more effectively control the Van Gogh and Coniston field operations, development,
and maintenance efforts, this FPSO (the Ningaloo Vision) was purchased from the lessor in January 2012. To accommodate production from Coniston, the FPSO is scheduled to go offline to the shipyard in early 2014 to complete required modifications.

The region will also continue development of the offshore Balnaves field, an oil accumulation located near
the Brunello gas field offshore Western Australia. The project is expected to deliver initial gross production of 30 Mb/d in 2014 utilizing a leased FPSO vessel. Apache has a 65-percent working interest in the project.

Further advances were made on the region’s largest development effort, which is the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG
project (Wheatstone) in Western Australia. The first phase of the Wheatstone project will comprise two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of approximately 8.9 million metric tons per annum (mtpa), a domestic gas plant, and
associated infrastructure. Apache has a 13-percent interest in the project and expects to invest approximately $4 billion over five years for the field and LNG facility development. Apache will supply gas to Wheatstone from its operated Julimar and
Brunello complex. The 65-percent interest Julimar development project is expected to generate average net sales to Apache of approximately 140 MMcf/d of gas (equivalent to 1.07 million mtpa of LNG) at prices pegged to world oil markets, 22
MMcf/d of sales gas into the domestic market, and 3,250 barrels of condensate per day. First production is projected for the end of 2016.

These development projects require significant capital investments above those for traditional drilling programs. During 2013, the region plans to invest approximately $1.9 billion for drilling,
recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition. Approximately $1.5 billion of our 2013 capital will be invested in long-lead development projects.

MarketingWestern Australia has historically had a local market for natural gas with a
limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in sales under mostly long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain periodic price revision clauses based on either the Australian consumer price index or a commodity linkage. As of
December 31, 2012, Apache had 21 active gas contracts in Australia with expiration dates ranging from






July 2014 to December 2026. Recent increases in demand and higher development costs have increased the prices required from the local market in order to support the development of new
supplies. As a result, market prices negotiated on recent contracts are substantially higher than historical levels.

We directly market all of our Australian crude oil production into Australian domestic and international markets at prices generally indexed to Dated Brent benchmark crude oil prices plus premiums, which
typically result in sales well above crude sold at West Texas Intermediate (WTI)-based prices.

During 2011,
advances were made on Wheatstone, with binding Sales and Purchase Agreements signed by two Asian customers for the delivery of approximately 60 percent of Apache’s net LNG offtake. In 2012, further advances were made on the Wheatstone project
with the signing of two non-binding Heads of Agreements, which will take the total committed delivery volumes to over 80 percent once the final binding Sales and Purchase Agreements are signed. These binding Sales and Purchase Agreements are
expected to be finalized and signed in 2013.

North Sea

OverviewApache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97-percent
working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region, having produced and sold oil volumes in excess of the proved reserves initially recorded. This success spurred last year’s
Mobil North Sea Limited (Mobil North Sea) acquisition, which provided the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland
fields and non-operated interests in the Maclure, Scott, and Telford fields. During 2012, we also announced that the U.K. Department of Energy & Climate Change awarded the region 11 new operated licenses and 1 non-operated license, which
together added approximately 613,000 gross acres to the region’s portfolio. Included in these licenses is all of the available acreage adjacent to the Beryl field plus two key licenses near the Forties field.

In 2012, the North Sea region produced 64 Mb/d of oil and 57 MMcf/d of natural gas, contributing 16 percent of
Apache’s worldwide production revenue, 10 percent of worldwide production and 6 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves. The region’s production was 36 percent higher compared to the prior year on production from the recently
acquired Beryl assets and an active drilling program in both the Forties and Beryl fields. Drilling in the Forties field continued to benefit from extensive 4-D seismic interpretations obtained over the last two years and has targeted many areas of
bypassed oil in the mature reservoir. A 3-D seismic survey of the Beryl field commenced in early August and, when completed, will further refine our drilling plans for these acquired assets. In 2012, 21 wells were drilled in the North Sea, of which
16 were productive. Two of the highest producing wells were the Beryl B72 well, which commenced production in May at a rate of 11.6 Mb/d and 13.1 MMcf/d, and the Beryl B73 well, which was completed in September with an initial rate of 8.2 Mb/d
and 5.9 MMcf/d. Apache has a 55-percent net interest in the Beryl field as of year-end.

The region also
made notable progress in several key development projects during the year. In April, production from the first Bacchus field well commenced at a peak rate of 6 Mb/d; in July, a second horizontal well was brought online at a peak rate of 9 Mb/d.
Combined production from the two wells has been steady at 10 Mb/d since July. Apache’s net interest is 50 percent. In September, the jacket for the Forties Alpha Satellite Platform was installed, with a topside and bridge scheduled to be
delivered during the second quarter of 2013. This platform has been constructed to continue to exploit new opportunities at Forties and sits adjacent to the main Alpha platform. It will provide an additional 18 drilling slots beginning in the third
quarter of 2013 along with power generation, fluid separation, gas lift compression, and oil export pumping.

In 2013, the region plans to invest approximately $900 million on a diverse set of capital projects. The region will
continue to refine drilling programs associated with properties acquired in the Mobil North Sea acquisition and integrate the additional opportunities gained over the last year.






MarketingWe have traditionally sold our North
Sea crude oil under both term contracts and spot cargoes. The term sales are composed of a market-based index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements. The prices received for spot cargoes are market driven
and can trade at a premium or discount to the market-based index.

Natural gas from the Beryl field is
processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further
downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.

Argentina

OverviewWe have had a continuous presence in Argentina since 2001 and have grown our holdings in the region through an active drilling program and targeted acquisitions. The
region currently has active operations in the provinces of Neuquén, Rio Negro, and Tierra del Fuego. We have interests in 32 concessions, exploration permits, and other interests totaling 4.4 million gross acres in four of the main
Argentine hydrocarbon basins: Neuquén, Austral, Cuyo, and Noroeste. Our concessions have varying expiration dates ranging from two years to over 15 years remaining, subject to potential extensions. Apache is currently in the process of
extending our concessions in the Tierra del Fuego and Rio Negro Provinces, which are scheduled to expire between 2015 and 2017. Future investment by Apache in the Tierra del Fuego and Rio Negro Provinces will be significantly influenced by the
ability to extend the present concessions.

In 2012, Argentina produced 6 percent of our worldwide production
and held 4 percent of our estimated proved reserves at year-end. We continue to focus our exploration and development activities in the Neuquén basin. During the year, the region drilled or participated in drilling 28 gross wells pursuant to
a development drilling program that achieved a 100-percent success rate by focusing on unconventional Gas Plus gas and shallow oil plays. Our 2012 exploration program included drilling two gross horizontal wells targeting the Vaca Muerta shale
formation, where we hold 1.3 million net acres, of which 586,000 net acres are in the oil play. In 2013, the region plans to finish testing and evaluating those wells in preparation for future drilling programs.

During 2013, the region plans to invest approximately $200 million for drilling, recompletion projects, development
projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition.

Marketing

Natural GasApache sells its natural gas in Argentina through three pricing structures:



•Gas Plus program: This program was instituted by the Argentine government in 2008 to encourage new gas supplies through the development of
conventional and unconventional (tight sands) reserves. Under this program, Apache is allowed to sell gas from qualifying projects at prices that are above the regulated rates. During 2012, the average Gas Plus volume sold by Apache was 73.2 MMcf/d
at an average price of $4.89 per Mcf. For 2013, Apache has signed contracts for total gross volumes to be sold under Gas Plus contracts of 80 MMcf/d at $5.01.



•Government-regulated pricing: The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the Argentine government and vary based on seasonal
factors and industry category. During 2012, we realized an average price of $0.84 per Mcf on government-regulated sales.



•Unregulated market: The majority of our remaining volumes are sold into the unregulated market. In 2012, realizations on sales in the unregulated
market averaged $3.52 per Mcf.



•The weighted average of government-regulated and unregulated sales for 2012 was $2.03 per Mcf.






Crude OilOur crude oil is subject to an
export tax, which effectively limits the prices buyers are willing to pay for domestic sales. Domestic oil prices are currently based on $42 per barrel, plus quality adjustments and local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or
decrease as market prices deviate from the base price.

Other Exploration

New Ventures

Apache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, high-reward exploration
opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. The New Ventures group was established in 2010 with a worldwide program focused on deepwater exploration, where many of the world’s large oil discoveries have
occurred over the last decade, unconventional resources in North America and elsewhere, and underexplored basins that can be developed through application of new technologies.

Apache’s 2012 activities included drilling in offshore Kenya; participating in the Suriname bid round and winning
offshore block 53; establishing a presence in several known U.S. resource plays; and acquiring seismic and spudding our first well on our acreage in the Cook Inlet of Alaska. Apache’s first exploration well in Kenya, the Mbawa 1, was drilled in
the third quarter of 2012, encountering approximately 170 feet of natural gas pay in three zones. We have a 50-percent interest in the block and continue to analyze the well data to determine future exploration activities. In Alaska, the New
Ventures team has acquired approximately 700,000 net acres over the last two years in the Cook Inlet basin and has commenced a robust seismic study over the area to facilitate future drilling activity. Apache has also leased nearly 500,000 net acres
in the Mississippian Lime play in Kansas and Nebraska and 300,000 net acres in Montana’s Williston basin. We have commenced drilling activity in both of these plays.

During 2013, we plan to invest approximately $100 million to further these projects and continue pursuing additional
exploration opportunities.

Major Customers

In 2012, 2011, and 2010 purchases by Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries accounted for 20 percent, 11 percent, and
15 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues. In 2011, purchases by the Vitol Group accounted for 13 percent of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in 2012 we participated in drilling 1,486 gross wells, with 1,408 (95 percent) completed as producers. Historically, our drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on
exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, our operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to our completed wells, at year-end several
wells had not yet reached completion: 70 in the U.S. (55.73 net); 11 in Canada (9.00 net); 26 in Egypt (26.00 net); 2 in Australia (1.65 net); and 4 in Argentina (3.75 net).

As of December 31, 2012, we had 5,229,947, 1,940,328, and 2,596,636 net acres
scheduled to expire by December 31, 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively, if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms. We strive to continue the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through
operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third-parties including governments.

As of December 31, 2012, 37 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage and 47 percent of Canadian undeveloped acreage
was held by production.






Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological
and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be
expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which
excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new
wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are
reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted
indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.

The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of December 31, 2012, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2012, held flat for the life of the
production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a 6:1 energy equivalent ratio. This ratio is
not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

As of December 31, 2012, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of
1,441 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate, and NGLs and 8.5 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the energy equivalent of 2.9 billion barrels of oil or 17.1 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 41 percent. As of
December 31, 2012, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled 1,982 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled 870 MMboe, or approximately 30 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or
possible reserves in this filing.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves
and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 14—Supplemental Oil and Gas
Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum,
end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of 870 MMboe as of December 31, 2012, decreased by 128 MMboe
from 998 MMboe of PUD reserves estimated at the end of 2011. Driven by the significant decline in North America natural gas prices, a portion of our PUD reserves fell below the threshold for economic development and were removed from our proved
reserves balance. The majority of these pricing revisions were associated with dry gas development projects in Canada. During the year, Apache converted 133 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In
North America, we converted 98 MMboe, with the remaining 35 MMboe in our international areas. We acquired 47 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year. We added 158 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries and had negative revisions
of 200 MMboe associated with changes in product prices and revised development plans.

During the year, a
total of approximately $3.4 billion was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of 2011. A portion of our costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved
developed reserves in future years. We spent $1.5 billion on PUD reserve development activity in North America and $1.9 billion in the international areas. Other than our Julimar/Brunello development project, which is tied to the construction
schedule of the Wheatstone LNG project, with projected first production in 2016, we had no material amounts of PUD reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more after they were initially disclosed as PUD reserves and no material
amounts of PUD reserves which are scheduled to be developed beyond five years from December 31, 2012.

Preparation
of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are reasonably
certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized
group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain
the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights
consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our
corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.






Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is
the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and
over 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by
the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the
reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. Apache selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. We also consider other factors such as geographic location, new wells
drilled during the year and reserves volume. During 2012, the properties selected for each country ranged from 77 to 99 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 86 percent of the
reserves value of our international proved reserves and of the new wells drilled in each country. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review.
The review covered 83 percent of total proved reserves, including 86 percent of proved developed reserves and 74 percent of PUD reserves.

During 2012, 2011, and 2010, Ryder Scott’s review covered 88, 81, and 72 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 83, 70, and 63 percent,
respectively, of the Company’s total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scott’s review of 2012 covered 81 percent of U.S., 78 percent of Canada, 64 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 84 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the
U.K.’s total proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s review of 2011 covered 68 percent of U.S., 69 percent of Canada, 58 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 62 percent of Egypt, and 61 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.
Ryder Scott’s review of 2010 covered 59 percent of U.S., 42 percent of Canada, 64 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 83 percent of Egypt, and 83 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves. We have filed Ryder Scott’s
independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their
review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved
reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Remediation Plans and Procedures

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations to ensure rapid and effective responses to
spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties as required by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE) 30 CFR 254.30. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans.
These drills include the participation of spill response contractors, representatives of the Clean Gulf Associates, and representatives of governmental agencies. In the event of a spill, the CGA is the primary oil spill response association
available to Apache and ADW. Apache and ADW have received approval for the Plans from BSEE. Apache and ADW personnel each review their respective Plan biennially and update where necessary.

In the event that CGA resources are already being utilized, other associations are available to Apache. Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), which entitles any Apache entity worldwide
to access OSRL’s service. OSRL has access to resources from the Global Response Network, a collaboration of






ADW has also retained the Helix Well Containment Group (HWCG) in conjunction with its CGA membership. HWCG is a
consortium of 24 deepwater operators in the Gulf of Mexico that have worked on expanding capabilities to rapidly respond to subsea well incidents like the Deepwater Horizon incident. In June 2011, HWCG announced that it is now capable of responding
to a subsea well containment incident in water depths of up to 10,000 feet. Each HWCG member company has entered into a mutual aid agreement, allowing any member to draw upon the technical expertise and resources of the group in the event of an
incident. ADW’s 2012 membership dues were approximately $1 million.






Apache also participates in a number of industry-wide task forces that are
studying ways to better access and control blowouts in subsea environments and increase containment and recovery methods. Two such task forces are the Subsea Well Control and Containment Task Force and the Offshore Operating Procedures Task Force.

Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of
oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and in the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other
independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in
countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across six countries, and our balanced production mix between
oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar political, geographic, and production diversity. Our global
position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the six countries in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business
environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and
operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and
regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of
operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry, as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our
industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these
requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all
countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs
incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and
compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
