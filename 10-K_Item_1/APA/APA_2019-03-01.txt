ITEMS 1 and 2.BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

GENERAL

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. Apache currently has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea). Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

BUSINESS STRATEGY

Our VISION is to be the premier exploration and production company, contributing to global progress by helping meet the world's energy needs.

Our MISSION is to grow in an innovative, safe, environmentally responsible, and profitable manner for the long-term benefit of our stakeholders.

Our STRATEGY is to take a differentiated approach to the exploration and production of cost-advantaged hydrocarbons through innovation, technology, optimization, continuous improvement, and relentless focus on costs to deliver top-tier, long-term returns.

Rigorous management of the Company’s asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long term.  Over the past several years, Apache has entered into a series of transactions that have upgraded its portfolio of assets, enhanced its capital allocation process to further optimize investment returns, and increased focus on internally generated exploration with full-cycle, returns-focused growth. These efforts included the monetization of certain non-strategic assets; including exiting operations in Canada and Australia, divesting of its interest in the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation (SAGE) system and pipeline in the North Sea, and selling other non-core leasehold and asset positions. The Company made strategic decisions to allocate the proceeds of these divestitures to more impactful development opportunities, including development of our Alpine High discovery in the Delaware Basin. We now have a diversified portfolio that features strong free cash flow generating assets in Egypt and the North Sea, which benefit from premium Brent crude oil pricing, and top-tier assets in the Permian Basin, the combination of which are the Company’s foundation for returns-focused growth.

Additionally, in November 2018 the Company completed a transaction with Kayne Anderson Acquisition Corp. (KAAC) and its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus) to create a publicly traded, pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation anchored by Apache’s gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. Subsequent to the transaction, KAAC was renamed to Altus Midstream Company (ALTM). This strategic transaction facilitates funding the capital intensive midstream infrastructure and enhances the allocation of Apache’s capital to further development of the vast Alpine High upstream resource base, while maintaining control and a significant stake in the contributed assets.








For a more in-depth discussion of the Company’s2018results, divestitures, strategy, and its capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW

Subsequent to the Altus transaction, Apache management has established a new reporting segment for its Altus midstream business separate from upstream oil and gas development activities in the U.S. The following business overviews further describe the operations and activities for the Company’s exploration and production properties and Altus midstream properties.

Exploration and Production Properties and Activities

Apache has exploration and production operations in three geographic areas: the U.S., Egypt, and the North Sea. Apache also has exploration interests in Suriname that may, over time, result in a reportable discovery and development opportunity.

The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key2018data for each of Apache’s operating areas. Additional data and discussion is provided in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

(2)Sales volumes from the North Sea for2018were20.3MMboe. Sales volumes may vary from production volumes as a result of the timing of liftings in the Beryl field.

United States

In2018, Apache’s U.S. operations contributed approximately 56 percent of production and 72 percent of estimated year-end proved reserves. Apache has access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across its 6.5 million gross acres in the U.S., 71 percent of which are undeveloped.

In the U.S., Apache has two onshore regions:

•The Permian region located in west Texas and New Mexico includes the Permian sub-basins: the Midland Basin, Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and Delaware Basin. Examples of shale plays within this region include the Woodford, Barnett, Pennsylvanian, Cline, Wolfcamp, Bone Spring, and Spraberry.

•The Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region includes the Granite Wash, Tonkawa, Marmaton, Cleveland, and other formations of the western Anadarko Basin, the Canyon Lime formation in the Texas panhandle, the Woodford-SCOOP and Stack plays located in central Oklahoma, and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas.

Apache also has one offshore region in North America, the Gulf of Mexico region, which consists of both shallow and deep water exploration and production activities.

Permian RegionThe Permian region is one of Apache’s core growth areas. Highlights of the Company’s operations in the region include:

•Over 2.9 million gross acres with exposure to numerous plays focused primarily in the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform/Northwest Shelf, and the Delaware Basin.

•Estimated proved reserves of 770 MMboe at year-end 2018, representing 62 percent of the Company’s worldwide proved reserves.








•Annual production of210.9Mboe/d increased34 percentfrom 2017. Fourth-quarter 2018 production increased 6 percent from the prior sequential quarter and 33 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017, a reflection of the success of the Midland Basin drilling program and the continued production ramp up at Alpine High, which first came online in May 2017.

•In 2018, the Permian region averaged 17 rigs and drilled or participated in 284 wells, 238 of which were horizontal, with a 98 percent success rate.

In late 2016, Apache announced the discovery of a significant new resource play, “Alpine High.” Apache’s Alpine High acreage lies in the southern portion of the Delaware Basin, primarily in Reeves County, Texas. Apache has identified over 3,500 economic drilling locations in a wet gas play and over 1,000 locations in a dry gas play at Alpine High. Over the past year, the Company focused on transitioning to full-field development of the Alpine High play, optimizing spacing, patterns, and completions and building efficiencies to reduce drilling and lifting costs. During 2018, Apache drilled 100 wells at Alpine High with a 96 percent success rate, including many concept test wells drilled to verify its understanding of the play. Using data collected from strategic testing and delineation drilling, the Company is now optimizing wells drilled in Alpine High and focusing on economic rich gas development in 2019. Combined with multi-well pad drilling and revenue uplift expected from oil and NGLs present in the wet gas play, Alpine High is anticipated to generate strong cash margins and a competitive recycle ratio when compared to other Permian operations.

In addition to activity in Alpine High, the Permian region drilled or participated in 184 wells in 2018, with a 98 percent success rate.

Apache plans to continue focusing a majority of its capital activity in the Permian region during 2019, balancing capital investments between its larger development project at Alpine High and focused exploration and development programs on other core assets in its Permian region. During 2019, the Company expects to average approximately 12 drilling rigs in the Permian region, which includes five rigs at Alpine High largely focused on development drilling.

Midcontinent/Gulf Coast RegionApache’s Midcontinent/Gulf Coast region includes 1.7 million gross acres and over 3,000 producing wells primarily in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle and the Eagle Ford shale in east Texas. In 2018, the region accounted for 10 percent of the Company’s production and approximately 9 percent of the Company’s year-end estimated proved reserves.

In 2018, Apache drilled 15 operated wells running a targeted program in the Woodford-SCOOP play and the Canyon Lime formation, which were all productive. In 2019, the region will continue its focus on high-grading acreage, building its inventory of future drilling locations, and pursuing potential divestiture opportunities for non-core positions.

Gulf of Mexico RegionThe Gulf of Mexico region comprises assets in the offshore waters of the Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana. In addition to its interest in several deepwater exploration and development offshore leases, when the Company sold in 2013 substantially all of its offshore assets in water depths less than 1,000 feet, it retained a 50 percent ownership interest in all exploration blocks and in horizons below production in development blocks, and access to existing infrastructure. Apache’s offshore technical teams continue to focus on evaluating subsalt and other deeper exploration opportunities in water depths less than 1,000 feet, which have been relatively untested by the industry, where high-potential deep hydrocarbon plays may exist. During 2018, Apache’s Gulf of Mexico region participated in 4 non-operated exploratory wells with an average 26 percent working interest, of which three were successful. The region contributed5.1Mboe/d to the Company’s total production for the year.

U.S. MarketingIn general, most of the Company’s U.S. natural gas production is sold at either monthly or daily index-based prices. The tenor of the Company’s sales contracts span from daily to multi-year transactions. Natural gas is sold to a variety of customers that include local distribution, utility, and midstream companies as well as end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. Apache strives to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Beginning in 2017, Apache began selling gas that was consumed in Mexico and to LNG export facilities in the U.S.

Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil production to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price or other regional pricing indices (e.g. LLS, WTS, or Midland), adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential.

Apache’s objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts. These term contracts typically have a firm transportation commitment and often provide for the higher of prevailing market prices from multiple market hubs.








Apache’s U.S. NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

Apache has contracted takeaway capacity (through a combination of volume commitments and acreage/plant dedications) in the Permian Basin on the following third-party pipelines that are currently under construction and expected to be in operation in 2019 and 2020 as further described under “Altus: Midstream Properties and Activities” below:

(i)550,000 dekatherms per day of residue gas for a 10-year term on the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline;

(ii)500,000 dekatherms per day of residue gas for a 10-year term on the Permian Highway Pipeline;

(iii)an acreage dedication of crude oil produced from Alpine High up to 75 MBbl/d of crude oil for a 10-year term on the EPIC Crude pipeline;

(iv)an acreage dedication to transport NGLs produced from Alpine High  to Waha for a 10-year term on the Salt Creek NGL Pipeline; and

(v)an acreage dedication for a 10-year term on Enterprise Products’ Shin Oak NGL Pipeline to transport up to 205 MBbl/d of Alpine High produced NGLs from the Salt Creek NGL Pipeline terminus in Waha to Mont Belvieu.

This takeaway capacity will allow greater flexibility and market optionality for Apache’s Permian Basin production, including increasing volumes from Alpine High.

International

In2018, international assets contributed44 percentof Apache’s production and55 percentof oil and gas revenues. Approximately28 percentof estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside the U.S.

Apache has two international regions:

•The Egypt region includes onshore conventional assets in Egypt’s Western Desert.

•The North Sea region includes offshore assets based in the United Kingdom.

The Company also has an offshore exploration program in Suriname.

EgyptApache has 23 years of exploration, development and operations experience in Egypt and is one of the largest acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end 2018, the Company held 6.2 million gross acres in 25 separate concessions. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 3 to 20 years, with extensions possible for additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Approximately 73 percent of the Company’s gross acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future.

Apache’s Egypt operations are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the terms of the Company’s PSCs, the contractor partner (Contractor) bears the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the Contractor receives entitlement to variable physical volumes of hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the Contractor’s income taxes, which remain the liability of the Contractor under domestic law, are paid by Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on behalf of the Contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the Contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because Contractor cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on its behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the Contractor income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on Apache’s Egypt operations despite impacting Apache’s production and reserves.










The Company’s estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves. In addition, Sinopec International Petroleum Exploration and Production Corporation (Sinopec) holds a one-third minority participation interest in Apache’s oil and gas operations in Egypt. The Egypt region, including the one-third noncontrolling interest, contributed32 percentof2018production and17 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves. Excluding the noncontrolling interest, Egypt contributed24 percentof2018production and12 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves.

In 2018, the region drilled 70 development and 45 exploration wells. Approximately 67 percent of the exploration wells were successful, further expanding Apache’s presence in the westernmost concessions and unlocking additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable Apache’s technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations. During 2017 and early 2018, Apache began shooting high-resolution 3-D seismic surveys in the West Kalabsha concession, the first of its kind in the Western Desert. The Company has completed seismic surveys covering over 1.25 million acres to date and will ultimately expand the shoot to cover the majority of its acreage in Egypt. The program will provide newer vintage, higher resolution imaging of the substrata across Apache’s Western Desert position, allowing the Company to build and high-grade its drilling inventory.

Heading into 2019, the region plans to advance its large-scale seismic shoot and continue to build its prospect inventory.  With recent acreage positions added over the past 18 months, the Egypt region will also drill wells in each of the new concession areas, thereby laying a foundation for potential growth.

Egypt MarketingApache’s natural gas production in Egypt is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids content.

Crude oil production is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil production sold to third parties is exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production sold to EGPC is sold at prices equivalent to the export market.

North SeaApache has interests in approximately 430,000 gross acres in the U.K. North Sea. The region contributed12 percentof Apache’s 2018 production and approximately11 percentof year-end estimated proved reserves.

Apache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of 4-D seismic. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl, Ness, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and a non-operated interest in the Maclure field. Apache also has a non-operated interest in the Nelson field acquired in 2011. The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant exploration opportunity. The North Sea region plays a strategic role in Apache’s portfolio by providing competitive investment opportunities and potential reserve upside with high-impact exploration potential.

During 2018, the region drilled 8 development wells with a 100 percent success rate: four at Forties, three at Beryl and one at Callater. In addition, the region drilled two exploration wells, one of which was unsuccessful.

Apache initiated production from its Garten development in the Beryl area in late November 2018, less than eight months after being drilled in March 2018. The discovery well at Garten encountered 778 feet of net oil pay in stacked, high-quality, Jurassic-aged sandstone reservoirs. Two lower zones were also successfully tested, and all three zones will ultimately be commingled to maximize recovery. Apache has a 100 percent working interest in the Garten development.

The Company plans to maintain its activity set in the North Sea for 2019, with two platform rigs (one at Forties and one at Beryl) and a semi-submersible rig.

North Sea MarketingApache has traditionally sold its North Sea crude oil under term contracts, with a market-based index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements.

Natural gas from the Beryl field is processed through the SAGE gas plant, which Apache divested to Ancala Midstream Acquisitions Limited in late 2017. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is processed further downstream. The split streams








of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.

Other Exploration

New VenturesApache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. Apache drilled an exploration well in the first half of 2017 in offshore Suriname, which was unsuccessful, and drilled no additional wells in Suriname during 2018. Plans for 2019 include drilling one well on Block 58 in offshore Suriname.

Delivery Commitments

Over the past two years, the Company has entered into several long-term delivery commitments primarily related to the continued development of Alpine High. These fixed-minimum sales volume commitments coincide with recent firm transportation agreements and takeaway capacity arrangements with third parties in the Permian Basin. The sales commitments require Apache to deliver an average of 260 Bcf of natural gas per year for the period from 2019 through 2029 at variable, market-based pricing.

Apache expects to fulfill the majority of these delivery commitments with production from its proved reserves. Any remaining commitments may be fulfilled with production from continued development and/or spot market purchases as necessary. The Company has not experienced any significant constraints in satisfying the committed quantities required by its sales commitments.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in2018, Apache participated in drilling 460 gross wells, with 435 (95 percent) completed as producers. Historically, Apache’s drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, Apache’s operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to Apache’s completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 125 gross (111.2 net) in the U.S., 16 gross (15.2 net) in Egypt, and 3 gross (2.1 net) in the North Sea.

Gross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out Apache’s gross and net acreage position as ofDecember 31, 2018, in each country where the Company has operations:

As ofDecember 31, 2018, 41 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage was held by production.

As ofDecember 31, 2018, Apache had 796,000 net undeveloped acres scheduled to expire by year-end2019if production is not established or Apache takes no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 2.1 million and 1.5 million net undeveloped acres set to expire in2020and2021, respectively. The Company strives to extend the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third parties, including governments.



Exploration concessions in Apache’s Egypt region comprise a significant portion of Apache’s net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. Apache has 632,000 net undeveloped acres expiring in Egypt during2019. Approximately 98,000 and 1.3 million net undeveloped acres are set to expire in2020and2021, respectively. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped acreage. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions and access to new concessions in areas in which it believes exploration opportunities exist.

Additionally, Apache has exploration interests in Suriname consisting of 1.8 million net undeveloped acres in two offshore blocks set to expire in 2020. Apache has acquired 3-D seismic surveys over all the acreage. No reserves have been booked on this undeveloped acreage.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.








Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.



The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as ofDecember 31, 2018, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in2018, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

(1)Includes total proved developed and total proved undeveloped reserves of63MMboe and5MMboe, respectively, attributable to a one-third noncontrolling interest in Egypt.

As ofDecember 31, 2018, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of581MMbbls of crude oil,234MMbbls of NGLs, and2.5Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of1.2 billionbarrels of oil or 7.4 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 47 percent. As ofDecember 31, 2018, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled1,081MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled153MMboe, or approximately 12 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this filing.

During2018, Apache added303MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity, partially offset by combineddownwardrevisions of previously estimated reserves of73MMboe. Engineering and performance downward revisions accounted for44MMboe, changes in product prices accounted for24MMboe, and interest revisions accounted for5MMboe.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as ofDecember 31, 2018,2017, and2016, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 15—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.








Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of153MMboe as ofDecember 31, 2018, increased by 2 MMboe from 151 MMboe of PUD reserves reported at the end of2017. During the year, Apache converted 76 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In the U.S., Apache converted 57 MMboe, with the remaining 19 MMboe in Apache’s international areas. Apache did not sell or acquire any PUD reserves during the year. Apache added 128 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. Apache recognized a 10 MMboe downward engineering revision in proved undeveloped reserves during the year. Other downward revisions included 24 MMboe associated with product prices, 11 MMboe associated with revised development plans, and 5 MMboe associated with interest revisions.

During the year, a total of approximately $446 million was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of2017. A portion of Apache’s costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. Apache spent approximately $322 million on PUD reserve development activity in the U.S. and $124 million in the international areas. As ofDecember 31, 2018, Apache had no material amounts of proved undeveloped reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure.

Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals is the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in Petroleum Engineering and over 30 years of experience in the energy industry and energy sector of the banking industry. The Executive Vice President of Planning, Reserves and Fundamentals reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. The Company selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. The Company also considers other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves volume. During2018, the properties selected for each country ranged from 84 to 91 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 88 percent of the reserves value of Apache’s international proved reserves and 95 percent of the reserves value of Apache’s new wells drilled worldwide. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The review covered 83 percent of total proved reserves by volume.

Ryder Scott’s review for the years2018,2017, and2016covered 86, 92, and 92 percent, respectively, of the value and 83, 84, and 83 percent, respectively, of the volume of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s2018review covered 82, 85, and 81 percent of the estimated proved reserve volume in the U.S., Egypt, and U.K., respectively.

Ryder Scott’s review of 2017 covered 84 percent of U.S., 85 percent of Egypt, and 81 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of 2016 covered 81 percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 85 percent of Egypt, and 92 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

The Company has filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.








According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Altus: Midstream Properties and Activities

In November 2018, Apache completed a previously announced transaction with KAAC and its then wholly-owned subsidiary Altus Midstream LP (collectively, Altus) to create a pure-play, Permian Basin to Gulf Coast midstream C-corporation anchored by Apache’s gathering, processing, and transmission assets at Alpine High. Pursuant to the agreement, Apache contributed certain Alpine High midstream assets and options to acquire equity interests in five separate third-party pipeline projects to Altus Midstream LP and/or its subsidiaries. In exchange for the assets, Apache received economic voting and non-economic voting shares in KAAC and limited partner interests in Altus Midstream LP, representing an approximate 79 percent ownership interest in the combined entities. Upon closing, KAAC changed its name to Altus Midstream Company (ALTM).

Apache fully consolidates the assets and liabilities of Altus in its consolidated financial statements, with a corresponding noncontrolling interest reflected separately.

Altus owns, develops, and operates gas gathering, processing, and transmission assets in the Permian Basin of West Texas. Altus primarily generates revenue by providing fee based natural gas gathering, compression, processing, and transportation services for Apache’s production from its Alpine High resource play. As ofDecember 31, 2018, Altus’s assets included approximately $1.2 billion of natural gas gathering, transmission, and processing infrastructure. This includes approximately 111 miles natural gas gathering pipelines, approximately 52 miles of residue-gas pipelines, and approximately 26 miles of NGL pipelines. Additionally, Altus owns five rich gas processing facilities consisting of approximately 77,000 horsepower with 380 MMcf/d of rich-gas processing capacity and two lean gas facilities consisting of 75,000 horsepower with 400 MMcf/d of lean-gas treating capacity. Other assets include an NGL truck loading terminal with six lease automatic custody transfer (LACT) units and eight NGL bullet tanks with 90,000 gallon capacity per tank.

Altus continues to invest in the development of its asset base. By the end of 2019, Altus has forecasted the completion of three cryogenic processing plants with combined nameplate capacity of approximately 600 MMcf/d. Additionally, Altus expects to add approximately 50 miles of gathering pipelines with expanded horsepower and compression capacity to service additional market outlets.

Joint Venture Pipeline Projects

Gulf Coast ExpressIn December 2018, Altus Midstream LP exercised and closed its option with Kinder Morgan Pipeline LLC, thereby acquiring a 15 percent equity interest in the Gulf Coast Express Pipeline Project (GCX). GCX is a long-haul natural gas pipeline that, upon completion, is expected to have capacity of approximately 2.0 Bcf/d and will transport natural gas from the Waha area in northern Pecos County, Texas to the Agua Dulce Hub near the Texas Gulf Coast. GCX will be operated by Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline LLC and is expected to be operational and in-service in the fourth quarter of 2019.

EPIC CrudeIn February 2019, Altus Midstream LP’s subsidiary exercised its option with EPIC Pipeline LP to acquire a 15 percent equity interest in the EPIC crude oil pipeline. The transaction is anticipated to close in the first quarter of 2019. The pipeline is a long-haul crude oil pipeline that, upon completion, is expected to have an initial throughput capacity of approximately 590 MBbl/d from the Permian Basin to Corpus Christi, Texas. The EPIC crude pipeline will be operated by EPIC Consolidated Operations, LLC and is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2020.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT APACHE

Response Plans and Available Resources

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations and offshore operations in the North Sea and Suriname. These plans ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties. Annually, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans.

Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL), a large international oil spill response cooperative, which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRL’s services. Apache also has a contract for global response resources and services with National Response Corporation (NRC). NRC is the world’s largest commercial Oil Spill Response Organization and is the global leader in providing end-to-end environmental, industrial, and emergency response solutions with operating bases in 13 countries.

In the event of a spill in the Gulf of Mexico, Clean Gulf Associates (CGA) is the primary oil spill response association available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a spill, CGA’s equipment, which is positioned at various staging points around the Gulf, is ready to be mobilized.

Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across three geographic areas, our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the geographic areas in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the energy industry as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
