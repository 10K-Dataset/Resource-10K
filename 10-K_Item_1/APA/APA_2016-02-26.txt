ITEMS 1 AND 2.BUSINESS AND PROPERTIES

General

Apache
Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. We currently have exploration and production interests in four countries:
the U.S., Canada, Egypt, and the U.K. (North Sea). Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. We treat all operations as one line of business.

Business Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a profitable exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible
manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, which are centered on the following core strategic components:



•rigorous portfolio management



•financial flexibility



•optimization of returns, earnings, and cash flow

Rigorous management of our asset portfolio plays a key role in optimizing shareholder value over the long-term. In 2015,
Apache completed a multi-year effort to refocus its portfolio and strengthen its financial position. As a part of this effort, the Company monetized certain capital intensive projects that were not accretive to







earnings in the near-term and other non-strategic assets. These divestitures included Apache’s interest in LNG projects in Australia and Canada, its exploration and production operations in
Australia and Argentina, and mature assets offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. The proceeds were used to reduce debt levels and redeployed to upgrade our portfolio.

Preserving financial flexibility is also key to our overall business philosophy. In response to the decline in commodity
prices, Apache immediately took proactive measures to reduce activity levels and focused on bringing costs into alignment with commodity prices. We reduced our capital investments by over 60 percent from 2014 levels and realized meaningful
reductions in drilling, operating, and overhead costs. These steps, coupled with our strategic divestitures, enabled us to reduce debt $2.5 billion and increase cash $700 million from year-end 2014. We accomplished this in spite of a 47 percent
decrease in crude oil realizations and a 44 percent decline in North American natural gas realizations.

For a more in-depth
discussion of our divestitures, strategy, 2015 results, and the Company’s capital resources and liquidity, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this

Geographic Area Overviews

We have exploration and production interests in four countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, and the U.K. North Sea. Apache also
pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in reportable discoveries and development opportunities. During 2015, the Company completed the sale of all of its operations in Australia. Results of operations and cash
flows for Australia operations are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s financial statements and are not included in the tables below.







The following table sets out a brief comparative summary of certain key 2015 data
for each of our operating areas. Additional data and discussion is provided in Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Form 10-K.

North America

Apache’s North American assets are primarily located in the Permian Basin, the Anadarko basin in western Oklahoma and the
Texas Panhandle, Gulf Coast and the offshore Gulf of Mexico areas of the U.S., and in Western Canada.

North America Onshore

OverviewWe have access to significant liquid hydrocarbons across our 10.7 million
gross acres onshore in the U.S. and Canada. Approximately 55 percent of this acreage is undeveloped. Additionally, 58 percent of Apache’s worldwide equivalent 2015 production and 72 percent of our estimated year-end proved reserves were in our
U.S. and Canada onshore regions. Over the past several years, Apache’s drilling activity has centered on our North America onshore assets, which delivered liquids growth of 4 percent during 2015 excluding the impacts of divestitures. To manage
our development efforts across our acreage positions within North America, our onshore assets are divided into a few key regions: Permian, MidContinent/Gulf Coast, and Canada.

Permian RegionOur Permian region controls over 3.3 million gross acres with exposure
to numerous plays across the Permian Basin. Apache is one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, with more than 14,300 producing wells in 163 fields, including 58 waterfloods and seven
CO2floods. The Permian region’s year-end 2015 estimated proved reserves were 684 MMboe, representing 44 percent of the Company’s worldwide reserves. Total region production for 2015
was up 6 percent sequentially, despite operating an average rig count of 12 compared to 40 rigs in the prior year. The reduced rig count reflected the Company’s decisive action to reduce capital spending in response to rapidly declining
commodity prices. During the year, we drilled or participated in drilling 378 wells, 217 of which were horizontal, with a 97 percent success rate.

In recent years, the region has been testing numerous formations and building a large inventory of horizontal opportunities in
several plays across our acreage position. In 2015, we ran a streamlined capital program that focused on efficiency improvements, downspacing and other strategic tests to further delineate several plays. Production growth was driven by Wolfcamp
wells in the Barnhart, Wildfire and Azalea areas of the Southern Midland Basin, the Bone Spring development program in the Delaware basin, and Yeso drilling on the Northwest shelf. In addition, the region continued to manage its completion inventory
as costs continued to fall throughout the year.







Given its acreage holdings and recent seismic data acquisitions, the
region’s deep portfolio of drilling inventory and opportunities allows us to focus efforts on the most economic wells and capital projects as the industry continues to adjust to current commodity price levels. Heading into 2016, we will
continue to operate in a reduced capital spending program and will balance larger development programs with exploration activity in several new areas.

MidContinent/Gulf Coast RegionAs part of our 2015 strategic efforts to reduce our
operating cost structure, we streamlined our organization by closing our regional office in Tulsa and combining our MidContinent and Gulf Coast onshore regions. Apache’s MidContinent/Gulf Coast region holds 2.8 million gross acres and
includes 3,402 producing wells primarily in western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and south Texas. Total region production in 2015 was 73 Mboe/d, comprising 13 percent of Apache’s worldwide production. The region’s year-end 2015 estimated
proved reserves were 154 MMboe.

In 2015, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 127 wells with a 99 percent success
rate. The region focused on drilling activities in the Canyon Lime, Eagle Ford, Marmaton, and Woodford formations with consistently strong results. Apache is active in the Woodford-SCOOP play in Central Oklahoma targeting the Woodford formation,
where we drilled or participated in drilling 33 wells. The region continues to work on optimizing fracture geometry and well spacing to reduce costs in this play. Apache’s prolific Canyon Lime and Woodford plays will again be a focus area for
region drilling activity in 2016.

Canada RegionApache entered the Canadian market in 1995
and currently holds nearly 3.6 million gross acres across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. The region’s large acreage position presents significant drilling opportunities and portfolio diversification with
exposure to oil, gas, and liquids rich fairways. Our Canadian region provided approximately 13 percent of Apache’s 2015 worldwide production and held 280 MMboe of estimated proved reserves at year-end.

In 2015, Apache drilled or participated in drilling 38 wells in the region with a 100 percent success rate. Drilling
operations continued in our established Swan Hills, Bluesky, and Glauconite plays, and we de-risked our Montney and Duvernay emerging growth plays. The results from the first seven-well pad in the Duvernay were encouraging. Moving to a pad
development decreased costs by 40 percent from 2014. The pad commenced production during the fourth quarter, with average 30 day initial production rates of 1,632 boe/d per well. Our Montney drilling has been focused in the Karr-Simonette and Wapiti
areas. The two initial wells in Karr-Simonette exceeded expectations with peak oil rates of 450 and 630 boe/d. We have also successfully tested the lower Montney in the Wapiti area. The region’s development activity in 2016 will primarily be
centered on the Duvernay and Montney programs.

As part of our assessment and rationalization of the Company’s North
American portfolio, in the second quarter of 2015 we divested our working interest in the Kitimat LNG development and approximately 333,000 of our net acres in the Horn River and Liard natural gas basins of British Columbia.

North America Offshore

Gulf of Mexico RegionThe Gulf of Mexico region comprises assets in the offshore waters of the
Gulf of Mexico and onshore Louisiana. Apache’s offshore technical teams continue to focus on subsalt and other deeper exploration opportunities in water depths less than 1,000 feet, which have been relatively untested by the industry. In
addition to the exploration and development of properties in shallower water, Apache continues to pursue joint venture and other monetization opportunities for its deepwater prospects, which offer exposure to significant reserve and production
potential in underexplored and oil-prone areas in water depths greater than 1,000 feet. During 2015, Apache’s Gulf of Mexico region contributed 9.2 Mboe/d to the Company’s total production.







North America Marketing

In general, most of our North American gas is sold at either monthly or daily market prices. Also, from time to time, the
Company will enter into fixed physical sales contracts for durations of up to one-year. These physical sales volumes are typically sold at fixed prices over the term of the contract. Our natural gas is sold primarily to local distribution companies
(LDCs), utilities, end-users, marketers, and integrated major oil companies. We strive to maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk. We transport some of our Canadian natural gas under firm
transportation contracts to delivery points into the U.S. in order to diversify our market exposure.

Apache primarily
markets its North American crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation companies, and refiners based on a West Texas Intermediate (WTI) price, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective differential.

In the U.S., our objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical
transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market
prices. Also, from time to time, the Company will enter into physical term sales contracts for durations up to five years. These term contracts typically have a firm transport commitment and often provide for the higher of prevailing market prices
from multiple market hubs.

In Canada, the crude is transported by pipeline or truck within Western Canada to market hubs
in Alberta and Manitoba where it is sold, allowing for a more diversified group of purchasers and a higher netback price. A portion of our trucked barrels are delivered and sold at rail terminals. We evaluate our transport options monthly to
maximize our netback prices.

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on local supply and
demand conditions, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

International

Apache’s international assets are located in Egypt and offshore U.K. in the North Sea. In 2015, international assets
contributed 40 percent of our production and 51 percent of our oil and gas revenues. Approximately 28 percent of our estimated proved reserves at year-end were located outside North America.

Egypt

OverviewOur operations in Egypt are conducted pursuant to production sharing contracts (PSCs). Under the
terms of the PSCs, the contractor partners bear the risk and cost of exploration, development, and production activities. In return, if exploration is successful, the contractor partners receive entitlement to variable physical volumes of
hydrocarbons, representing recovery of the costs incurred and a stipulated share of production after cost recovery. Additionally, the contractor income taxes, which remain the liability of the contractor under domestic law, are paid by Egyptian
General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on behalf of the contractor out of EGPC’s production entitlement. Income taxes paid to the Arab Republic of Egypt on behalf of the contractor are recognized as oil and gas sales revenue and income tax
expense and reflected as production and estimated reserves. Because our cost recovery entitlement and income taxes paid on our behalf are determined as a monetary amount, the quantities of production entitlement and estimated reserves attributable
to these monetary amounts will fluctuate with commodity prices. In addition, because the contractors’ income taxes are paid by EGPC, the amount of the income tax has no economic impact on the contractors despite impacting our production and
reserves.

Our activity in Egypt began in 1994 with our first Qarun discovery well, and today we are one of the largest
acreage holders in Egypt’s Western Desert. At year-end 2015, we held 6.7 million gross acres in 24 separate concessions. Approximately 73 percent of our acreage in Egypt is undeveloped, providing us with considerable







exploration and development opportunities for the future. Development leases within concessions currently have expiration dates ranging from 4 to 24 years, with extensions possible for additional
commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis. Our estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the host country’s share of reserves. Our operations in Egypt, including a one-third
noncontrolling interest, contributed 27 percent of our 2015 production and accounted for 19 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves and 36 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows. Excluding the noncontrolling interest,
Egypt contributed 20 percent of our 2015 production and accounted for 14 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves and 27 percent of our estimated discounted future net cash flows.

We have historically been one of the most active drillers in the Western Desert, however, 2015 activity was curtailed in all
regions in response to reduction in commodity prices. We drilled 97 development and 25 exploration wells in 2015. Approximately 60 percent of our exploration wells were successful, further expanding our presence in the westernmost concessions and
unlocking additional opportunities in existing plays. A key component of the region’s success has been the ability to acquire and evaluate 3-D seismic surveys that enable our technical teams to consistently high-grade existing prospects and
identify new targets across multiple pay horizons in the Cretaceous, Jurassic, and deeper Paleozoic formations.

Following
several years of political turmoil, Apache’s operations, located in remote locations in the Western Desert, continue to experience no production interruptions. We have also continued to receive development lease approvals for our drilling
program. However, a deterioration in the political, economic, and social conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource
nationalization, forced renegotiation or modification of our existing contracts with EGPC, or threats or acts of terrorism by groups such as ISIS, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
Apache purchases and maintains limited insurance covering its investments in Egypt. For information regarding such coverage, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Insurance Program of thisForm 10-K.

MarketingOur gas production is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, plus an upward adjustment for liquids
content. The region averaged $2.92 per Mcf in 2015.

Oil from the Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession, and other
nearby Western Desert blocks is sold to third parties in the export market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil sales are exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production that is sold
to EGPC is sold on a spot basis priced at Brent with a monthly EGPC official differential applied.

North Sea

OverviewApache entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97 percent working interest in
the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region and has established a large inventory of drilling prospects through successful exploration programs and the interpretation of acquired 3-D and 4-D
seismic data. Building upon its success in Forties, in 2011 Apache acquired Mobil North Sea Limited, providing the region with additional exploration and development opportunities across numerous fields, including operated interests in the Beryl,
Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields and non-operated interests in the Maclure field. In total, Apache has interests in approximately 1 million gross acres in the U.K. North Sea.

The North Sea region continues to play an important role in the overall Apache portfolio by providing competitive investment
opportunities across multiple horizons and potential reserve upside with high-impact exploration potential. In 2015, the North Sea region contributed 13 percent of worldwide consolidated production and 9 percent of year-end estimated proved
reserves. During the year, 23 development wells were drilled in the North Sea, of which 19 were productive. Apache has invested approximately $2.7 billion in infrastructure







improvements across all of its fields over the past decade resulting in significantly improved production efficiency and lower unit operating costs. With basin-wide leading production efficiency,
our infrastructure and offtake capabilities have positioned the region to be allocated a higher percentage of capital dollars for drilling and production.

The Beryl field, which is a geologically complex area with multiple fields and stacked pay potential, provides for significant
exploration opportunity. Following the completion of the first full-field 3-D acquisition since 1997, Apache recently announced two exceptional discoveries in the area, the K and Corona discoveries, and is moving ahead with development and
additional exploration efforts. The K discovery encompasses multiple commercial zones across three distinct fault blocks, including one fault block with over 1,500 feet of net pay and is projected to begin production mid-2017. The Corona discovery
logged 225 feet vertical depth net pay in reservoir-quality sandstone. Apache has 55 percent and 100 percent working interests in K and Corona, respectively. The 3-D acquisition has also indicated the potential for several future prospects similar
to K and Corona on Apache acreage in the Beryl area.

In addition to the K and Corona discoveries, Apache also announced
an appraisal well drilled approximately 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of the Forties complex. The Seagull discovery logged 672 feet of net oil pay over a 1,092-foot column in Triassic-age sands. Further appraisal work will continue following the
recent acquisition of a multi-azimuth 3-D survey. Apache is now operator of the license and has a 35 percent working interest in the project.

MarketingWe have traditionally sold our North Sea crude oil under term contracts, with a market-based
index price plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements.

Natural gas from the Beryl
field is processed through the SAGE gas plant operated by Apache. The gas is sold to a third party at the St. Fergus entry point of the national grid on a National Balancing Point index price basis. The condensate mix from the SAGE plant is
processed further downstream. The split streams of propane and butane are sold on a monthly entitlement basis, and condensate is sold on a spot basis at the Braefoot Bay terminal using index pricing less transportation.

Australia/Argentina

During the second quarter of 2015, Apache completed the sale of its Australian LNG business and oil and gas assets. In March
2014, Apache completed the sale of all of its operations in Argentina. Results of operations and consolidated cash flows for the divested Australia assets and Argentina operations are reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s
financial statements for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Other Exploration

New Ventures

Apache’s global New Ventures team provides exposure to new growth opportunities by looking outside of the Company’s
traditional core areas and targeting higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities located in frontier basins as well as new plays in more mature basins. Plans for 2016 include continued analysis and review of our deepwater prospects in
offshore Suriname.

Major Customers

In 2015, 2014, and 2013 purchases by Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries accounted for 11 percent, 19 percent, and 24
percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in 2015 we participated in drilling 693 gross wells, with 660 (95 percent) completed as producers. Historically, our
drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on exploitation and







extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, our operations outside of North America focus on a mix of exploration and development wells. In addition to
our completed wells, at year-end a number of wells had not yet reached completion: 41 gross (18.1 net) in the U.S., 45 gross (42.5 net) in Egypt, 7 gross (7 net) in Canada, and 3 gross (2.2 net) in the North Sea.

Gross and Net Undeveloped and Developed Acreage

The following table sets out our gross and net acreage position as of December 31, 2015, in each country where we have
operations:

As of December 31, 2015, Apache had 2.3 million net undeveloped acres scheduled to
expire by year-end 2016 if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms. Additionally, Apache has 1.5 million and 700,000 net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We strive to extend
the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through operational or administrative actions, but cannot assure that such extensions can be achieved on an economic basis or otherwise on terms agreeable to both the Company and third
parties, including governments.







Exploration concessions in our Egypt region comprise a significant portion of our
net undeveloped acreage expiring over the next three years. We have 1.8 million and 700,000 net undeveloped acres set to expire in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Apache will continue to pursue acreage extensions in areas in which it believes
exploration opportunities exist and over the past year has been successful in being awarded six-month extensions on targeted concessions. Longer term extensions are also being finalized with EGPC. There were no reserves recorded on this undeveloped
acreage.

As of December 31, 2015, 25 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage and 42 percent of Canadian net
undeveloped acreage was held by production.

Apache also holds 1.8 million net undeveloped acreage in two blocks in
Suriname expiring in 2017 and 2018.

Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs, which by analysis of
geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations.
Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements
utilizing the “economic interest” method, which excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

Proved undeveloped reserves include those reserves that are expected
to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting
development areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a
development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.







The following table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of
December 31, 2015, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2015, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are covered by physical contract terms. This table shows
reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a ratio of 6 Mcf to 1 bbl. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the two products.

As of December 31, 2015, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of 794 MMbbls of crude oil,
198 MMbbls of NGLs, and 3.4 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the volume equivalent of 1.6 billion barrels of oil or 9.4 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 51 percent. As of December 31, 2015, the
Company’s proved developed reserves totaled 1,332 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled 232 MMboe, or approximately 15 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or possible reserves in this
filing.

During 2015, Apache added 117 MMboe of proved reserves through exploration and development activity and 7 MMboe
through purchases of minerals in-place. We sold a combined 385 MMboe through several divestiture transactions. We recognized a 368 MMboe downward revision in proved reserves, of which 339 MMboe was related to lower product prices.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves, and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2015,
2014, and 2013, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 14—Supplemental Oil and Gas Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum, end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect
on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of 232 MMboe as of December 31, 2015, decreased by 513 MMboe from 745
MMboe of PUD reserves reported at the end of 2014. During the year, Apache converted 73 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In North America, we converted 40 MMboe, with the remaining 33 MMboe in
our international areas. We sold 240 MMboe and







acquired 7 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year. We added 56 MMboe of new PUD reserves through extensions and discoveries. We recognized a 263 MMboe downward revision in proved undeveloped
reserves during the year, of which 202 MMboe was associated with lower product prices.

During the year, a total of
approximately $1.4 billion was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of 2014. A portion of our costs incurred each year relate to development projects that will be converted to proved developed
reserves in future years. We spent approximately $900 million on PUD reserve development activity in North America and $500 million in the international areas. As of December 31, 2015, we had no material amounts of proved undeveloped
reserves scheduled to be developed beyond five years from initial disclosure.

Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache’s reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to
revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized group
of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain the
necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights consistent
with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our corporate and
operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.

Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is the person primarily responsible for overseeing
the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and over 35 years of industry experience with
positions of increasing responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer.

The estimate of reserves disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is prepared by the Company’s internal staff, and
the Company is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of those estimates. However, the Company engages Ryder Scott Company, L.P. Petroleum Consultants (Ryder Scott) to review our processes and the reasonableness of our estimates of proved
hydrocarbon liquid and gas reserves. Apache selects the properties for review by Ryder Scott based primarily on relative reserve value. We also consider other factors such as geographic location, new wells drilled during the year and reserves
volume. During 2015, the properties selected for each country ranged from 82 to 100 percent of the total future net cash flows discounted at 10 percent. These properties also accounted for over 86 percent of the reserves value of our
international proved reserves and 91 percent of the new wells drilled in each country. In addition, all fields containing five percent or more of the Company’s total proved reserves volume were included in Ryder Scott’s review. The
review covered 83 percent of total proved reserves by volume.

During 2015, 2014, and 2013, Ryder Scott’s review
covered 90, 91, and 92 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 83, 85, and 86 percent, respectively, of the Company’s total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scott’s review of 2015 covered 81
percent of U.S., 81 percent of Canada, 86 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

Ryder Scott’s review of 2014 covered 83 percent of U.S., 75 percent of Canada, 99.5 percent of Australia,
86 percent of Egypt, and 94 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.







Ryder Scott’s review of 2013 covered 84 percent of U.S., 82 percent of
Canada, 63 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 88 percent of Egypt, and 88 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves.

We have filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and interpretations
presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by Apache are, in
aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Employees

On
December 31, 2015, we had 3,860 employees.

Offices

Our principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas

The current lease on our principal executive offices runs through December 31, 2019. We have two, five-year options to extend the lease through 2024 and 2029, which may be exercised in five or ten-year increments. For information regarding the
Company’s obligations under its office leases, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Contractual Obligations and
Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.

Title to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of appropriate
professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire properties. We believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry, subject
only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding royalty, or other
outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of arbitral or
governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas leases, and other
encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations.

Additional Information about Apache

In this section, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Apache” include Apache
Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically stated.

Remediation Plans and Procedures

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), developed Oil Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their
respective Gulf of Mexico operations to ensure rapid and effective responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties as required by the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). Annually, drills are
conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans. These drills include the participation of spill response contractors, representatives of Clean Gulf Associates (CGA), and representatives of governmental agencies.







In the event of a spill, CGA is the primary oil spill response association
available to Apache and ADW. Both Apache and ADW are members of CGA, a not-for-profit association of producing and pipeline companies operating in the Gulf of Mexico. CGA was created to provide a means of effectively staging response equipment and
providing immediate spill response for its member companies’ operations in the Gulf of Mexico. In the event of a spill, CGA’s equipment, which is positioned at various staging points around the Gulf, is ready to be mobilized.

In the event that CGA resources are already being utilized, other resources are available to Apache. Apache is a member of Oil
Spill Response Limited (OSRL), which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to access OSRL’s service. In addition, ADW is a member of Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) and National Response Corporation (NRC), and their resources are
available to ADW for its deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. The equipment and resources available to MSRC and NRC change from time to time, and current information is generally available on each company’s website.

An Apache subsidiary is also a member of the Marine Well Containment Company (MWCC) to help the Company fulfill the
government’s permit requirements for containment and oil spill response plans in deepwater Gulf of Mexico operations. MWCC is a not-for-profit, stand-alone organization whose goal is to improve capabilities for containing an underwater well
control incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Members and their affiliates have access to MWCC’s extensive containment network and systems. As of December 31, 2015, Apache’s investment in MWCC totals $172 million and is reflected in
“Deferred charges and other” in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet.

Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of oil and
gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other
independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established
strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established
production bases across four countries, our balanced production mix between oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess
similar geographic and production diversity. Our global position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the four countries in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in
response to changes in commodity prices, local business environments, and markets. It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties and facilities, we are subject to numerous federal, provincial,
state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil and gas lease for the
cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a substantial impact upon the
energy industry as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.







We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with
these requirements, which we believe are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all
countries in which we do business. We have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs
incurred under these policies and procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and
compliance with regulations and laws that have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.
