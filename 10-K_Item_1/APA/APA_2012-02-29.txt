General

Apache Corporation, a Delaware corporation formed in 1954, is an independent energy company that explores for, develops, and produces natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids. We currently have
exploration and production interests in six countries: the U.S., Canada, Egypt, Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North Sea (North Sea), and Argentina. Apache also pursues exploration interests in other countries that may over time result in
reportable discoveries and development opportunities. We treat all operations as one line of business.

Properties to which we refer in this document may be held by subsidiaries of Apache
Corporation. References to “Apache” or the “Company” include Apache Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries unless otherwise specifically stated.

Growth Strategy

Apache’s mission is to grow a
profitable global exploration and production company in a safe and environmentally responsible manner for the long-term benefit of our shareholders. Apache’s long-term perspective has many dimensions, which are centered on the following core
strategic components:



•balanced portfolio of core assets



•conservative capital structure



•rate of return focus







Throughout the cycles of our industry, these strategies have underpinned our
ability to deliver long-term production and reserve growth and achieve competitive returns on invested capital for the benefit of our shareholders. We have increased reserves 23 out of the last 26 years and production 31 out of the past 33 years, a
testament to our consistency over the long-term.

Apache pursues opportunities for growth through exploration
and development drilling, supplemented by strategic acquisitions. In 2011, we generated approximately $10 billion of cash flows from operations, which enabled us to deliver on an aggressive capital budget investing approximately $8 billion across
all of our regions, while paying down nearly $1 billion in debt. Approximately one-quarter of our global capital was spent on leasehold acreage, seismic data, gathering and processing facilities, long-lead development projects, and front-end
engineering and design (FEED) studies tied to our LNG projects. Coupled with an active drilling program and an increasing new venture exploration effort, these longer-term investments secure a platform for continued long-term profitable growth.

We have also been significantly active in the acquisition market for the past two years, having identified
several opportunities that met our criteria for risk, reward, rate of return, and growth potential. As we head into 2012, Apache continues to be active with recent acquisition announcements in Australia and the Anadarko basin of the central U.S.
Each of our acquisitions fit well with our long-term strategy of maintaining a balanced portfolio of core assets by adding high-quality properties with a diversity of geologic and geographic risk, product mix, and reserve life to nearly all of our
regions. The properties are strategically positioned with our existing infrastructure and play to the strengths that come with our operating experience.

2012 Acquisitions

Australian Burrup Holdings
Limited acquisitionOn January 31, 2012, a subsidiary of Apache Energy Limited completed the acquisition of a 49-percent interest in Burrup Holdings Limited (BHL) for $439 million, including working capital
adjustments. BHL is the owner of an ammonia fertilizer plant on the Burrup Peninsula of Western Australia.

Central Anadarko basin acquisitionApache announced in January 2012 that we agreed to
acquire Cordillera Energy Partners III LLC (Cordillera), a privately held company, for $2.2 billion in cash and approximately 6.3 million shares of Apache common stock. The merger is expected to close in the second quarter of 2012.

2011 Acquisitions

North Sea acquisitionOn December 30, 2011, Apache completed the acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited (Mobil North Sea) from Exxon Mobil Corporation with cash
consideration of $1.25 billion.

2010 Acquisitions

Gulf of Mexico Shelf acquisitionOn June 9, 2010, Apache completed the acquisition of
oil and gas assets in the Gulf of Mexico shelf from Devon Energy Corporation for $1.05 billion.

Mariner
mergerOn November 10, 2010, Apache completed the acquisition of Mariner Energy, Inc. (Mariner) for stock and cash consideration totaling $2.7 billion. We also assumed approximately $1.7 billion of Mariner’s debt
with the merger.

Permian acquisitionOn August 10, 2010, we completed the
acquisition of BP plc’s (BP) oil and gas operations, acreage, and infrastructure in the Permian Basin for $2.5 billion, net of preferential rights to purchase.

Canadian acquisitionOn October 8, 2010, we completed the acquisition of substantially
all of BP’s upstream natural gas business in western Alberta and British Columbia for $3.25 billion.







Egyptian acquisitionOn November 4, 2010,
we completed the acquisition of BP’s assets in Egypt’s Western Desert for $650 million.

In the
midst of our heightened exploration, development drilling, and acquisition activity, we have remained committed to our core strategies of maintaining a balanced portfolio, conservative capital structure, and rate of return focus.

Balanced Portfolio of Core Assets

A cornerstone of our long-term strategy is balancing our portfolio of assets through diversity of geologic risk, geographic risk, hydrocarbon mix (crude oil versus natural gas), and reserve life in order
to achieve consistency in results. Our portfolio of geographic locations provides variation of all of these factors. We have exploration and production operations in six countries, through ten distinct regions: the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, Gulf of
Mexico Deepwater, Gulf Coast Onshore, Permian, and Central regions of the U.S., Canada, Egypt, the U.K. North Sea, Australia, and Argentina.

Each of our regions has achieved an economy of scale providing a vehicle for cost-effective base production and a combination of low- and medium-risk drilling opportunities. The net cash provided by
operating activities (cash flows) generated by our current production base funds our worldwide exploitation and drilling program and development capital for prior exploration discoveries. In addition, a portion of our cash flows generated each year
is allocated to pursue new exploration targets over our 28 million gross undeveloped acres and new areas around the globe. Our continued diligence on allocating capital across multiple regions and various projects has produced a balanced
portfolio of assets that consistently delivers positive cash flows and has become a foundation for future growth opportunities.

In 2011:



•No single region contributed more than 22 percent of our equivalent production or 29 percent of revenue.



•No single region held more than 26 percent of our year-end estimated proved reserves.



•The mixture of reserve life (estimated reserves divided by annual production) in our regions, which offers a balance in timing of investment
returns, ranges from five years to 22 years.



•Our balanced product mix provides a measure of protection against price deterioration in a given product while retaining upside potential in the
event of a significant increase in the commodity price for either product. In 2011, crude oil and liquids provided 50 percent of our production and 79 percent of our revenue.



•International Dated Brent crudes and sweet crude from the Gulf Coast, which represent 76 percent of our crude oil production, continue to be priced
at a significant premium to West Texas Intermediate (WTI)-based prices.



•Our international gas portfolio, which accounted for 34 percent of our 2011 worldwide natural gas production, positions us to take advantage of
increasing prices in Argentina and Australia while North American gas prices continue to languish.

Conservative Capital Structure

Maintaining a strong balance sheet and the financial flexibility it provides is a core component of our long-term strategy and we believe one of our most important strategic assets. This approach
underpins our ability to weather commodity price volatility and has enabled us to deliver long-term production and reserves growth throughout the cycles of our industry. It is also key in positioning us to pursue value-creating acquisitions when
opportunities arise.







During 2011, we met our objectives to fund our exploration and development
capital with operating cash flows and to reduce the Company’s debt to $7.2 billion. Specifically, we exited the year with a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 20 percent, down from 25 percent at year-end 2010. In addition, as of December 31,
2011, we had access to $3.3 billion of available committed borrowing capacity, up from $2.4 billion at year-end 2010.

Rate of Return Focus

Another core component to our long-term strategy is focusing on rate of return. We do so through centralized management and incentive systems, decentralized decision making, cost control focus, and the
creative application of technology.

Our centralized management and incentive systems provide a uniform
process of measuring success across Apache and has instilled a rate-of-return focus into our culture. Our organizational structure incentivizes high rate-of-return activities but allows for appropriate risk-taking to drive future growth and monetize
reserves. Results of operations and rate of return on invested capital are measured monthly, reviewed with management quarterly, and utilized to determine annual performance awards. We review capital allocations, at least quarterly, utilizing
estimates of internally generated cash flows. We do this through a disciplined and focused process that includes analyzing current economic conditions, projected rate of return on internally generated drilling prospects, opportunities for tactical
acquisitions, land positions with additional drilling prospects and occasionally, new core areas that could enhance our portfolio.

We also use technology to reduce risk, decrease time and costs, and maximize recoveries from reservoirs. Apache scientists and engineers have been granted numerous patents for a range of inventions, from
systems used for interpreting seismic data and processing well logs to improvements in drilling and completion techniques.

North America

Apache’s North American asset base primarily comprises operations in the Permian Basin, the central U.S., the Gulf
Coast areas of the U.S. and operations in Western Canada. In 2011, our North America assets contributed 55 percent of our production and 46 percent of our oil and gas production revenues. At year-end 2011, 69 percent of our estimated proved reserves
were located in North America.

United States

OverviewWe have 10.3 million gross acres across the U.S., approximately half of which
is undeveloped. As a result of recent acquisitions and a diversity of growth and opportunity profiles, we divided our U.S. assets into five regions: Permian, Central, Gulf of Mexico Shelf, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf Coast Onshore. We also
have leasehold acreage holdings in Alaska. Our holdings in the U.S. provide a balance of hydrocarbon mix and reserve life and an opportunity for continued exploration. In 2011, 50 percent of our U.S. production and 62 percent of our U.S. year-end
reserves were oil and liquids. In addition, the reserve life of our U.S. regions ranged from five to 22 years with the Gulf of Mexico offshore region’s shorter-lived reserves balancing longer-lived reserves in the Central and Permian regions.
In 2011, 38 percent of Apache’s equivalent production and 43 percent of Apache’s total year-end reserves were in the U.S.

Gulf Coast RegionsOur Gulf Coast assets are primarily located in and along the Gulf of Mexico, in the areas onshore and offshore Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi.
Recent acquisitions have significantly increased Apache’s presence in the area and have bolstered an already deep inventory of projects with additional development and exploration opportunities for multiple years. The area is divided into three
regions, which include the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf Coast Onshore.

In water
less than 500 feet deep, which constitutes most of our Gulf of Mexico Shelf region, Apache is currently the largest producer and has been the largest offshore held-by-production acreage owner since 2004. The Gulf of Mexico Shelf region has
approximately 3 million gross acres covering 622 offshore blocks with nearly 80 percent of the blocks held-by-production. The region contributed 14 percent of our worldwide production and 15 percent of worldwide revenue during 2011. With
prolific wells, strong cash flows, and a strategic position near the petrochemical-industrial complex on the U.S. Gulf Coast, the region has consistently generated high rates of return allowing the region to play a vital role in funding investments
in other regions. Although regulations issued in 2010 have slowed the issuance of drilling permits for all operators, during 2011 the region drilled or participated in 35 wells with a 71-percent success rate. We drilled 36 wells in 2010 and 20 wells
in 2009.

In water greater than 500 feet deep, the Gulf of Mexico Deepwater region is a relatively
underexplored and oil prone area that provides exposure to significant reserve and production potential. Apache’s strategic presence in the area was gained through the 2010 Mariner merger, and the Company now owns approximately 750,000 gross
acres across 148 blocks as of the end of 2011. The Deepwater region contributed approximately two percent of Apache’s worldwide production; however, there are multiple projects underway. The Bushwood, Wide Berth, and Mandy development projects
are projected to begin production in the second quarter of 2012 with combined net initial production of 12 Mboe/d. In addition, the larger scale non-operated Lucius project was sanctioned in the fourth quarter of 2011. Apache has an 11.7-percent
working interest in this development with first production projected for 2014. The region is also increasing its exploration activity, having recently been awarded four deepwater exploration plans. We expect to drill or participate in drilling nine
wells during 2012 compared to two wells drilled in the current year.

Apache’s Gulf Coast Onshore region
was established in August 2010 to more fully exploit the opportunities built over the years in onshore areas of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi. The region has a significant acreage position of approximately 1.4 million gross acres, including
330,000 mineral fee acres. During the year, the region focused on drilling shallow and moderate depth targets, increasing acreage holdings, and expanding our







regional 3-D seismic databases. We are also evaluating several unconventional resource opportunities. The region drilled or participated in drilling 50 wells during 2011 and projects drilling
approximately 40 wells in 2012, including increased activity in unconventional and deeper exploitation.

In
2012, the Company plans to invest approximately $1.0 billion, $500 million, and $350 million in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf, Gulf of Mexico Deepwater, and Gulf Coast Onshore regions, respectively. The capital will be spent on drilling, recompletion,
and development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, seismic acquisitions, and plugging and abandonment of wells and platforms. We spent $363 million on abandonment activities in 2011 over the entire Gulf Coast area.

Central RegionThe Central region includes more than 2,500 producing wells and
controls over one million gross acres primarily in western Oklahoma and the Texas panhandle. Most of the region’s acreage is held-by-production. The region’s reserves and production are primarily natural gas; however, a transformation from
vertical to horizontal drilling has evolved over the last two years, and the region is now targeting oil and liquids-rich gas plays given the continued price disparity between oil and gas. The result of focusing on oil and liquid plays was evident
during 2011 with oil production nearly doubling and NGL production up 244 percent compared to the prior year. Total region production was up 14 percent as we drilled or participated in drilling 108 wells, 94 percent being completed as producers. The
region’s year-end 2011 estimated proved reserves represented five percent of Apache’s worldwide total.

The primary target for the region’s liquids-focused objective has been in the Anadarko basin’s Granite Wash play, with 50 wells brought on production during 2011. Thirty-three of these were
operated wells that had average 30-day gross rates of approximately 500 b/d and 4.5 MMcf/d. The Granite Wash consists of a series of thick, multi-layered formations of low-permeability and liquids-rich sandstones. We have operated in this area
for 50 years drilling vertical wells, but the play has recently re-emerged as a horizontal drilling play with multi-staged fracturing technology. We drilled our first operated horizontal well in the Granite Wash in 2009 and have continued to pursue
cost efficiencies and reduce drilling time.

The region has also increased its focus on oil plays in the
Anadarko shelf Cherokee formation and the Texas Panhandle Cleveland formation. In 2011, we drilled 12 wells in the Cherokee formation and 10 wells in the Cleveland formation with an average 30-day gross production rate of 350 b/d and
500 Mcf/d.

With its growing success in oil and liquids-rich gas plays, the region has been active on the
acquisition and divestiture front. In March 2011, Apache acquired 92,400 net acres in the Whittenburg basin of Oldham County, Texas, which is emerging as a potential new oil play for Apache. The acreage is immediately south of the Panhandle Dolomite
field and directly north of two 25-well Canyon Wash fields. For 2012, the region plans to increase its Whittenburg activity level to include horizontal drilling and has recently completed the acquisition of 244 square miles of 3-D seismic data.
Separately, in 2011 the region divested its natural gas properties in east Texas. The divestiture, which was completed in December 2011, included dry gas wells that were producing approximately 31 MMcf/d net to Apache.

In January 2012, the Company announced entry into a merger agreement to acquire Cordillera, a privately held company with
approximately 254,000 net acres in the Granite Wash play, nearly 18 Mboe/d of current production, and estimated proved reserves of 71.5 MMboe. This doubles Apache’s acreage in the Granite Wash area and adds a robust drilling inventory that will
be immediately integrated into our existing plans. The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2012 and allows for Cordillera to acquire up to $100 million in additional leasehold acreage in the Granite Wash and other plays
through closing.

With the recent completed and pending acquisitions, the region plans to double its activity
in 2012. The region plans to invest approximately $800 million in drilling, recompletions, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and lease acquisitions.







Permian RegionOur Permian region controls
over three million gross acres with exposure across the Permian Basin. The region’s property and acreage base increased substantially after completing the 2010 BP acquisition and Mariner merger, and integrating these assets was a key focus
during 2011. Apache is now one of the largest operators in the Permian Basin, operating more than 12,000 wells in 152 fields, including 45 waterfloods and six CO2 floods. Total region production was up over 38 percent sequentially as a result of the
prior-year acquisitions and a drilling program that is continuing to ramp up. We averaged running 25 rigs during the year, drilling or participating in 507 wells. Only two dry holes were drilled, including a non-operated well. The Permian
region’s year-end 2011 estimated proved reserves were 751 MMboe and represent 25 percent of Apache’s total proved reserves.

The key focus areas of our activity during the year continued to be the horizontal redevelopment of legacy waterflood units and the multi-zone development of the Deadwood area. Deadwood is the most active
of our plays in the Permian Basin where we ran an average of 11 rigs and drilled 195 wells. Gross oil production in Deadwood exceeded 8 Mb/d and 17 MMcf/d at the end of the year, which compares with 2 Mb/d and 6 MMcf/d at the beginning of the year.
Our gas volumes plateaued in this area in the fourth quarter because of midstream constraints. In order to increase capacity in 2012, the region began construction in the third-quarter 2011 on a natural gas processing facility in a 50-percent joint
venture with Crosstex Energy, L.P. We expect to drill over 300 wells in Deadwood during 2012, and we have an inventory of approximately 1,000 additional vertical locations across multiple formations and stacked pay zones on 20-acre spacing.

Apache continued horizontal redevelopment of its waterflood units during 2011 with the drilling of 38
operated horizontal wells. Seven fields were tested with a 100-percent success rate. Three of these fields are under full horizontal development with the remaining fields in the testing phase. The region has identified an additional 23 major
waterflood units and fields to be developed horizontally.

The Permian region is building a large inventory of
other horizontal opportunities based on success achieved during 2011 along with the continued integration of the prior year BP acquisition and Mariner merger. As we head into 2012, the Company continues to advance several plays, including Bone
Springs, Wolfcamp Shale, Cline Shale, and off-structure Grayburg formations. Given a current inventory of over 10,000 locations, the region has a strong portfolio of drilling opportunities for multiple years. For 2012, the Permian region plans to
invest approximately $1.7 billion in drilling, recompletion projects, equipment upgrades, expansion of existing facilities and equipment, and leasing new acreage.

U.S. MarketingIn general, most of our U.S. gas is sold at either monthly or daily market
prices. Our natural gas is sold primarily to local distribution companies (LDCs), utilities, end-users, and integrated major oil companies. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce the concentration of credit risk.

Apache primarily markets its U.S. crude oil to integrated major oil companies, marketing and transportation
companies, and refiners. The objective is to maximize the value of crude oil sold by identifying the best markets and most economical transportation routes available to move the product. Sales contracts are generally 30-day evergreen contracts that
renew automatically until canceled by either party. These contracts provide for sales that are priced daily at prevailing market prices.

Apache’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, less the costs for transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the
purchaser.

Canada

OverviewApache has 7.5 million gross acres across the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Our acreage base provides a significant
inventory of both low-risk development drilling opportunities in and around a number of Apache fields and higher-risk, higher-reward exploration opportunities. At year-end 2011, our Canadian region represented approximately 26 percent of our
estimated proved reserves. In 2011, we drilled or participated in 143 wells in Canada.







Our conventional oil assets comprise a wide variety of opportunities from
Southeast Saskatchewan to Northwest Alberta. An increased focus on these assets during 2011 resulted in drilling 70 wells, enabling us to take advantage of current strong oil price realizations. We utilized advanced reservoir modeling and horizontal
drilling technology to identify and exploit unswept oil in existing waterflood projects in the House Mountain, Leduc, Snipe Lake, and Provost areas. Additionally, we continued efforts on our enhanced oil recovery project at Midale with expansion of
CO2 injection and assessment of new seismic data.

In the Kaybob and West 5 areas, the region continues to
have success in the development of liquids-rich natural gas plays. These areas have focused primarily on the Bluesky, Montney, and Glauconite formations through horizontal drilling and multi-stage fracture completions. In addition, drilling costs
have been driven down throughout the year. Horizontal oil plays in the Viking, Dunvegan, and Cardium formations are emerging, and we expect to further develop these opportunities as part of our 2012 drilling program.

In 2012, the Canadian region plans to drill 170 wells, investing approximately $700 million in drilling and
development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition.

MarketingOur Canadian natural gas marketing activities focus on sales to LDCs, utilities,
end-users, integrated major oil companies, supply aggregators, and marketers. We maintain a diverse client portfolio, which is intended to reduce our concentration of credit risk in our portfolio. To diversify our market exposure, we transport
natural gas via firm transportation contracts to California and the Chicago area. We sell the majority of our Canadian gas on a monthly basis at either first-of-the-month or daily prices.

Canadian crude oil production is sold to integrated major companies, refiners, and marketing companies based on a WTI
price, adjusted for quality, transportation, and a market-reflective negotiated differential. We maximize the value of our condensate and heavier crudes by determining whether to blend the condensate into our own crude production or sell it in the
market as a segregated product. The crude is transported from Western Canada to the market hubs in Alberta and Manitoba, which allows for a more diversified group of purchasers and a higher netback price.

The region’s NGL production is sold under contracts with prices based on market indices, less the costs for
transportation and fractionation, or on a weighted-average sales price received by the purchaser.

International

Apache’s international assets are located in Egypt, Australia, offshore the U.K. in the North
Sea, and Argentina. In 2011, international assets contributed 45 percent of our production and 54 percent of our oil and gas revenues. At year-end 2011, 31 percent of our estimated proved reserves were located outside North America.







Egypt

OverviewOur commitment to Egypt began in 1994 with our first Qarun discovery
well. Today we control 9.7 million gross acres making Apache the largest acreage holder in Egypt’s Western Desert. Only 18 percent of our gross acreage in Egypt has been developed, with gross production of 217 Mb/d and 865 MMcf/d
in 2011, or 104 Mb/d and 365 MMcf/d net to Apache. We believe this makes Apache the largest producer of liquid hydrocarbons and natural gas in the Western Desert and the third largest in all of Egypt. The remaining 82 percent of our acreage is
undeveloped, providing us with considerable exploration and development opportunities for the future. We have 3-D seismic covering over 12,000 square miles, or 78 percent of our acreage. In 2011, the region contributed 29 percent of
Apache’s worldwide production revenue, 22 percent of our worldwide production, and 10 percent of our year-end 2011 estimated proved reserves. Our estimated proved reserves in Egypt are reported under the economic interest method and exclude the
host country share reserves.

Our operations in Egypt are conducted pursuant to production-sharing agreements
in 24 separate concessions, under which the contractor partner pays all operating and capital expenditure costs for exploration and development. Development leases within concessions generally have a 25-year life, with extensions possible for
additional commercial discoveries or on a negotiated basis, and currently have expiration dates ranging from five to 25 years. A percentage of the production on development leases, usually up to 40 percent, is available to the contractor partners to
recover operating and capital expenditure costs, with the balance generally allocated between the contractor partners and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) on a contractually defined basis.

Apache’s Egyptian operations continue to expand further into the Western Desert and achieved a record for annual
production in 2011. Compared to the prior year, gross daily production was up 12 percent, and net daily production was up two percent. Throughout 2011, we maintained an active drilling and development program, drilling 221 exploration, development,
and injector wells, resulting in 33 new field discoveries. Most notably, we drilled the first Paleozoic discovery at Tayim West, which test-flowed at 3,600 b/d. This Paleozoic discovery opens a new play deeper than previous discoveries in the
Western Desert and provides for continued exploration opportunities. We also made our first discovery in the Siwa Concession, our westernmost concession in Egypt, with the Siwa D-1X well that test-flowed at 4,490 b/d and 8 MMcf/d.

Building on prior year discoveries, we continued our drilling success in the Faghur basin having ten new field
discoveries in the year that tested in aggregate over 33 Mb/d and 25 MMcf/d. These wells are the most recent in a series of oil discoveries in the Alam El Buieb (AEB), Safa, and now Paleozoic reservoirs that support the multi-pay potential of the
oil prone basin. We also started to actively drill on acreage acquired in the 2010 BP acquisition. We drilled 21 successful wells on this acreage and have increased gross production by over 7 Mb/d and 39 MMcf/d. In addition to the increased drilling
activity, we continue to assess opportunities to leverage existing processing and transportation infrastructure at the BP-acquired Abu Gharadig field complex and expand our processing facilities in the Faghur and Matruh basins. Maintaining and
increasing infrastructure capacity is a critical component to our growth goals in the Western Desert.

Heading
into 2012, the region plans to invest approximately $1.0 billion for drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition. Our drilling program includes a combination of
development and exploration wells with current plans to drill approximately 20 percent more wells than in 2011.

Egypt political unrestIn February 2011, former Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak stepped
down, and the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces took power. In November 2011, Egypt held its first round of parliamentary elections. Despite the Muslim Brotherhood’s Freedom and Justice Party’s victory in the parliamentary
elections, Egypt remains under martial law. Although Egypt’s first post-revolutionary parliament convened on January 23, 2012, the new Parliament remains subordinate to the Egyptian Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, which has stated its
intention to turn over power to civilians following the presidential election







expected in June 2012. Apache’s operations, located in remote locations in the Western Desert, have continued uninterrupted; however, a deterioration in the political, economic, and social
conditions or other relevant policies of the Egyptian government, such as changes in laws or regulations, export restrictions, expropriation of our assets or resource nationalization, and/or forced renegotiation or modification of our existing
contracts with EGPC could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Apache purchases multi-year political risk insurance from the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and other highly rated international insurers covering its investments in Egypt. In the
aggregate, these policies, subject to the policy terms and conditions, provide approximately $1 billion of coverage to Apache for losses arising from confiscation, nationalization, and expropriation risks, with a $237.5 million sub-limit for
currency inconvertibility. In addition, the Company has a separate policy with OPIC, which provides $225 million of coverage, including a self-insured retention of $37.5 million, for losses arising from (1) non-payment by EGPC of arbitral
awards covering amounts owed Apache on past due invoices and (2) expropriation of exportable petroleum when actions taken by the government of Egypt prevent Apache from exporting our share of production.

MarketingOur gas production is sold to EGPC primarily under an industry-pricing formula, a
sliding scale based on Dated Brent crude oil with a minimum of $1.50 per MMBtu and a maximum of $2.65 per MMBtu, which corresponds to a Dated Brent price of $21.00 per barrel. Generally, this industry-pricing formula applies to all new gas
discovered and produced. In exchange for extension of the Khalda Concession lease in July 2004, Apache agreed to accept the industry-pricing formula on a majority of gas sold, but retained the previous gas-price formula (without an oil price cap)
until the end of 2012 for up to 100 MMcf/d gross. The region averaged $4.66 per Mcf in 2011.

Oil from the
Khalda Concession, the Qarun Concession and other nearby Western Desert blocks is sold primarily to third parties in the Mediterranean market or to EGPC when called upon to supply domestic demand. Oil sales are made either directly into the Egyptian
oil pipeline grid, sold to non-governmental third parties including those supplying the Middle East Oil Refinery located in northern Egypt, or exported from or sold at one of two terminals on the northern coast of Egypt. Oil production that is
presently sold to EGPC is sold on a spot basis priced at Brent with a monthly EGPC official differential applied.

Australia

OverviewApache’s holdings in Australia are focused offshore Western Australia in the Carnarvon basin, where we have operated since acquiring the gas
processing facilities on Varanus Island and adjacent producing properties in 1993, in the Exmouth basin and in the Browse basin. Production operations are located in the Carnarvon and Exmouth basins. In total, we control approximately
8.8 million gross acres in Australia through 35 exploration permits, 16 production licenses, and 10 retention leases. Approximately 90 percent of our acreage is undeveloped.

During 2011, the region had net production of 38 Mb/d of oil and 185 MMcf/d of natural gas, contributing 10 percent of
Apache’s worldwide production revenue, 9 percent of worldwide production and 11 percent of year-end estimated proved reserves. Production compared to the prior year was 13 percent lower as a result of numerous tropical cyclones, repairs to the
Floating Production Storage and Offloading vessel (FPSO) that services our Van Gogh oil field, and natural decline in the Pyrenees and Van Gogh oil fields.

Offsetting production declines was the start-up of two new developments offshore Western Australia. In June 2011, Apache’s Halyard-1 gas discovery well commenced production into the domestic gas
market. The Halyard development, which largely utilized existing Apache-operated pipelines and facilities, was completed ahead of schedule and set the stage for further development of our nearby Spar field. The region also completed development of
the Reindeer gas field and construction of the Devil Creek Gas Plant in December. This plant is







Western Australia’s third domestic natural gas processing hub and the first new hub to be constructed in more than 15 years. Gas from the development has been sold to a number of customers
in Western Australia’s growing mining and minerals processing sectors at prices significantly higher than current realizations.

The region also drilled several significant exploration and development wells in 2011. We participated in drilling nine wells during 2011, of which five were productive. Ongoing exploration activity at
Apache’s Julimar and Brunello complex resulted in the discovery of a deeper Mungaroo gas pool encountering 362 feet of net pay. This 65-percent working interest Balnaves Deep well is associated with continuing field development efforts and
augments previous discoveries. Separately, the Zola-1 natural gas discovery logged 410 feet of net pay and is on trend with the Gorgon gas field 16 miles to the north and near both existing and developing infrastructure. The evaluation of this
30-percent working interest discovery, including the planning of future appraisal drilling, is currently underway.

In addition, the region has a pipeline of projects that are expected to contribute to production growth as they are brought on-stream over coming years.

The 2010 Spar-2 discovery is projected to commence production in 2013 through an extension of the Halyard subsea
infrastructure, which will also allow for the tie-in of future wells.

First production is also projected in
2013 from four completed gas wells in the Macedon gas field. We have a 29-percent non-operating working interest in the field. Gas will be delivered via a 60-mile pipeline to a 200 MMcf/d gas plant to be built at Ashburton North in Western
Australia. The project, approved in 2010, is currently underway. Apache has successfully marketed nearly all of its proved reserves in the Macedon field under long-term contracts.

In 2011, the Coniston oil field project, which lies just north of the Van Gogh field, was sanctioned for development.
First production is projected for 2013. The field will be produced via subsea completions tied back to the FPSO at Van Gogh. To more effectively control the Van Gogh and Coniston field operations, development, and maintenance efforts, this FPSO (the
Ningaloo Vision) was purchased from the lessor in January 2012.

The region will also proceed with development
of the offshore Balnaves field, an oil accumulation located near the Brunello gas field offshore Western Australia. The project is expected to deliver initial gross production of 30 Mb/d in 2014 utilizing a leased FPSO vessel. Apache has a
65-percent working interest in the project.

During 2011, the Company and its partners announced they will
proceed with the Chevron-operated Wheatstone LNG development project (Wheatstone) in Western Australia. The first phase of the Wheatstone project will comprise two LNG processing trains with a combined capacity of approximately 8.9 million
metric tons per annum (mtpa), a domestic gas plant, and associated infrastructure. Apache has a 13-percent interest in the project and expects to invest approximately $4 billion over five years for the field and LNG facility development. Apache will
supply gas to Wheatstone from its operated Julimar and Brunello complex. The 65-percent interest Julimar development project is expected to generate average net sales to Apache of approximately 140 MMcf/d of gas (equivalent to 1.07 million mtpa
of LNG) at prices pegged to world oil markets, 22 MMcf/d of sales gas into the domestic market, and 3,250 barrels of condensate per day. First production is projected for 2016.

These development projects require significant capital investments above traditional drilling programs. During 2012, the
region plans to invest approximately $1.8 billion for drilling, recompletion projects, development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition. Approximately 75 percent of the 2012 investment will be for
development and processing facilities in connection with the projects discussed above.







In February 2012, a subsidiary closed on the acquisition of a 49-percent
interest in Burrup Holdings Limited, which owns an ammonia plant on the Burrup Peninsula of Western Australia. Apache has been supplying natural gas to this plant since it commenced operations in 2006. This acquisition allowed Apache to stabilize
the overall plant project, which was in receivership. The plant, which has been rebranded Yara Pilbara, has a production capacity of 760,000 mtpa and is one of the world’s largest ammonia production facilities.

MarketingWestern Australia has historically had a local market for natural gas with a
limited number of buyers and sellers resulting in sales under mostly long-term, fixed-price contracts, many of which contain periodic price revision clauses based on either the Australian consumer price index or a commodity linkage. As of
December 31, 2011, Apache had 22 active gas contracts in Australia with expiration dates ranging from November 2012 to December 2026. Recent increases in demand and higher development costs have increased the supply prices required from the
local market in order to support the development of new supplies. As a result, market prices negotiated on recent contracts are substantially higher than historical levels.

We directly market all of our Australian crude oil production into Australian domestic and international markets at
prices generally indexed to Dated Brent benchmark crude oil prices plus premiums, which typically result in sales well above NYMEX oil prices.

North Sea

OverviewApache
entered the North Sea in 2003 after acquiring an approximate 97-percent working interest in the Forties field (Forties). Since acquiring Forties, Apache has actively invested in the region having produced and sold oil volumes in excess of the proved
reserves initially recorded. Forties, which Apache acquired with 45 producing wells, now has 75 producing wells with a substantial inventory of future drilling locations.

In 2011, the North Sea region produced 20 MMboe of which approximately 99 percent was crude oil. The region represents
seven percent of our total worldwide production and 13 percent of Apache’s oil and gas production revenues. In 2011, the region’s production decreased four percent compared to the prior year as natural well decline and unplanned
maintenance downtime exceeded gains from drilling. The drilling program, however, was successful and benefited greatly from a new 4-D seismic interpretation derived from the latest 3-D seismic survey acquired over Forties in 2010. The data
highlighted many areas of bypassed oil in the reservoir and provided better definition of existing targets. In 2011, 14 wells were drilled in Forties, of which 11 were productive. Two of the highest producing wells were the Charlie 4-3 well, which
commenced production in June at a rate of 12.6 Mb/d, and the Charlie 2-2 well, which was completed in March with an initial rate of 11.9 Mb/d. These rates were some of the highest in the Forties since 1990.

In addition, the region acquired an 11.5 percent non-operated interest in the Nelson field in early 2011, and on
December 30, 2011, closed on the acquisition of Mobil North Sea Limited from Exxon Mobil Corporation. The assets acquired include operated interests in the Beryl, Nevis, Nevis South, Skene, and Buckland fields; operated interest in the
Beryl/Brae gas pipeline and the SAGE gas plant; non-operated interests in the Maclure, Scott, and Telford fields; and Benbecula (west of Shetlands) exploration acreage. These major legacy assets bring the region quality reservoirs with significant
remaining reserve life, high production efficiency, and a portfolio of low-risk exploitation projects. Beginning in 2012, production from the former Mobil North Sea fields will add to the percentage of Apache’s current output that is indexed to
the premium Brent crude oil benchmark price. These acquisitions expand Apache’s presence in the North Sea and increase its portfolio of future drilling locations.

Estimated proved reserves recorded at the end of the year for the acquired properties totaled 61 MMboe, bringing
Apache’s total estimated proved reserves at year-end 2011 to 197 MMbbls of crude oil in this region, or approximately seven percent of our worldwide year-end estimated proved reserves.







In 2012, the region will invest approximately $950 million on a diverse set
of capital projects. Forties will see another year of active drilling with two platform rigs operating the entire year along with a partial year of jack-up drilling at the Echo platform. Construction of the Forties Alpha Satellite Platform is
underway and is projected to be complete by the third quarter of 2012. This platform will sit adjacent to the main Alpha platform and provide an additional 18 drilling slots along with power generation, fluid separation, gas lift compression, and
oil export pumping. The region will also work to integrate the acquired Mobil North Sea properties and plans to drill three wells on these properties during the year along with well recompletions and workovers.

MarketingWe have traditionally sold our Forties crude under both term contracts and spot
cargoes. The term sales are composed of a market-based index prices plus a premium, which reflects the higher market value for term arrangements. The prices received for spot cargoes are market driven and can trade at a premium or discount to the
market-based index. All 2012 production from Forties will be sold under a term contract with a per-barrel premium to the Dated Brent index. Production from the former Mobil North Sea fields will also be indexed to the premium Brent crude oil
benchmark price.

Argentina

OverviewWe have had a continuous presence in Argentina since 2001, which was expanded substantially by two acquisitions in 2006. We currently have operations in the
Provinces of Neuquén, Rio Negro, Tierra del Fuego, and Mendoza. We have interests in 34 concessions, exploration permits, and other interests totaling 3.7 million gross acres in four of the main Argentine hydrocarbon basins:
Neuquén, Austral, Cuyo, and Noroeste. Our concessions have varying expiration dates ranging from three years to over 15 years remaining, subject to potential extensions. In 2011, Argentina produced six percent of our worldwide production and
held four percent of our estimated proved reserves at year-end.

In 2011, the region achieved record
production of 48 Mboe/d and drilled 36 gross wells pursuant to a development drilling program that achieved a 97 percent success rate by focusing on unconventional premium gas and shallow oil targets. Our exploration program included drilling six
gross wells in 2011. We are continuing to test two vertical wells targeting the Vaca Muerta formation in the Huacalera and Cortadera areas and are targeting oil in two recent exploration wells drilled in the Cuyo basin.

During the year, Apache’s first horizontal well in the Anticlinal Campamento field in the Neuquén basin began
producing at a rate over 10 MMcf/d. The well was a test of horizontal drilling and multi-stage hydraulic fracturing in the low-permeability pre-Cuyo formation. In the third quarter, we completed the first horizontal multi-stage hydraulically
fractured shale gas well drilled and completed in South America. The region will continue to evaluate the use of horizontal drilling techniques on tight and unconventional gas resources in the pre-Cuyo, Los Molles, and Vaca Muerta formations of the
Neuquén basin, as these formations receive the benefit of higher gas prices under the Gas Plus program, as defined below.

Apache added acreage during the year in the Neuquén and Noroeste basins, increasing the region’s unconventional oil and gas potential. We also began negotiations for extensions of concessions
in the Tierra del Fuego and Rio Negro Provinces, which are scheduled to expire between 2015 and 2017. Future investment by Apache in the Tierra del Fuego and Rio Negro Provinces will be significantly influenced by the ability to extend the present
concessions.

During 2012, the region plans to invest approximately $250 million for drilling, recompletion
projects, development projects, equipment upgrades, production enhancement projects, and seismic acquisition.







Marketing

Natural GasApache sells its natural gas through three pricing structures:



•Gas Plus program: This program was instituted by the Argentine government in 2008 to encourage new gas supplies through the development of
conventional and unconventional (tight sands) reserves. Under this program, Apache is allowed to sell gas from qualifying projects at prices that are above the regulated rates. During 2011, the average Gas Plus volume sold by Apache was 55.1 MMcf/d
at an average price of $4.89 per Mcf. In addition, Apache signed or extended Gas Plus contracts with industrial consumers totaling gross rates of 15.5 MMcf/d at $4.28 per Mcf through December 31, 2012.



•Government-regulated pricing: The volumes we are required to sell at regulated prices are set by the Argentine government and vary with seasonal
factors and industry category. During 2011, we realized an average price of $1.06 per Mcf on government-regulated sales.



•Unregulated market: The majority of our remaining volumes are sold into the unregulated market. In 2011, realizations averaged $3.14 per Mcf.

Crude OilOur crude oil is subject to an export tax, which
effectively limits the prices buyers are willing to pay for domestic sales. Domestic oil prices are currently based on $42 per barrel, plus quality adjustments and local premiums, and producers realize a gradual increase or decrease as market prices
deviate from the base price. In Tierra del Fuego, similar pricing formulas exist; however, Apache retains the value-added tax collected from buyers, effectively increasing realized prices by 21 percent. As a result, 2011 oil prices realized from
Tierra del Fuego oil production averaged $76.51 per barrel as compared to our Neuquén basin production, which averaged $64.16 per barrel.

Other Exploration

New Ventures

Apache continues to pursue numerous exploration opportunities in new areas across the globe. In Cook Inlet, Alaska, where
we are currently the largest acreage holder with approximately 800,000 gross acres, we plan to conduct a seismic survey and drill a well within the next 12 months. During 2012, we also plan to drill a well in deepwater Kenya, where we hold a
50-percent working interest and are the operator. In the East Coast basin of New Zealand, where we have entered into a farm-in agreement to explore and potentially develop about 1.7 million gross acres, we expect to commence seismic operations
and drill our first four wells targeting new onshore unconventional oil plays during 2012. Apache will earn a 50-percent interest in the New Zealand exploration permits upon completing the seismic and drilling program planned for the next four
years.

During 2012, we plan to invest approximately $450 million to pursue exploration opportunities in new
areas where Apache has yet to establish an operating region.

Chile

In November 2007, Apache was awarded exploration rights on two blocks comprising approximately one million net acres on
the Chilean side of Tierra del Fuego. Upon careful evaluation of the exploration potential and economics of the blocks, we determined that these blocks are no longer prospective to Apache. As such, in the fourth quarter of 2011, we relinquished this
acreage and recorded a $60 million non-cash write-off of the carrying value of our oil and gas property balance in Chile.







Major Customers

In 2011, 2010, and 2009, purchases by Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries accounted for 11 percent, 15 percent,
and 18 percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues. In 2011, purchases by the Vitol Group accounted for 13 percent of the Company’s worldwide oil and gas production revenues.

Drilling Statistics

Worldwide in 2011 we participated in drilling 1,087 gross wells, with 1,005 (92 percent) completed as producers. Historically, our drilling activities in the U.S. have generally concentrated on
exploitation and extension of existing producing fields rather than exploration. As a general matter, our operations outside of the U.S. focus on a mix of exploration and exploitation wells. In addition to our completed wells, at year-end several
wells had not yet reached completion: 39 in the U.S. (28.44 net); 50 in Canada (42.69 net); 23 in Egypt (21.75 net); 6 in the North Sea (4.91 net); 1 in Australia (0.33 net); and 3 in Argentina (3.00 net).

scheduled to expire by December 31, 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively, if production is not established or we take no other action to extend the terms. We plan to continue the terms of many of these licenses and concession areas through
operational or administrative actions and do not project a significant portion of our net acreage position to expire before such actions occur.

As of December 31, 2011, 34 percent of U.S. net undeveloped acreage and 40 percent of Canadian undeveloped acreage was held by production.







Estimated Proved Reserves and Future Net Cash Flows

Proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas, crude oil, condensate, and NGLs that geological
and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing conditions, operating conditions, and government regulations. Estimated proved developed oil and gas reserves can be
expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. The Company reports all estimated proved reserves held under production-sharing arrangements utilizing the “economic interest” method, which
excludes the host country’s share of reserves.

PUD reserves include those reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or
from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Undeveloped reserves may be classified as proved reserves on undrilled acreage directly offsetting development areas that are reasonably certain of production
when drilled, or where reliable technology provides reasonable certainty of economic producibility. Undrilled locations may be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled
to be drilled within five years, unless specific circumstances justify a longer time period.

The following
table shows proved oil, NGL, and gas reserves as of December 31, 2011, based on average commodity prices in effect on the first day of each month in 2011, held flat for the life of the production, except where future oil and gas sales are
covered by physical contract terms. This table shows reserves on a boe basis in which natural gas is converted to an equivalent barrel of oil based on a 6:1 energy equivalent ratio. This ratio is not reflective of the current price ratio between the
two products.

As of December 31, 2011, Apache had total estimated proved reserves of
1,370 MMbbls of crude oil, condensate, and NGLs and 9.7 Tcf of natural gas. Combined, these total estimated proved reserves are the energy equivalent of 3.0 billion barrels of oil or 17.9 Tcf of natural gas, of which oil represents 39 percent. As of
December 31, 2011, the Company’s proved developed reserves totaled 1,992 MMboe and estimated PUD reserves totaled 998 MMboe, or approximately 33 percent of worldwide total proved reserves. Apache has elected not to disclose probable or
possible reserves in this filing.

The Company’s estimates of proved reserves, proved developed reserves
and PUD reserves as of December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009, changes in estimated proved reserves during the last three years, and estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves are contained in Note 14—Supplemental Oil and Gas
Disclosures in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K. Estimated future net cash flows as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, were calculated using a discount rate of 10 percent per annum,
end of period costs, and an unweighted arithmetic average of commodity prices in effect on the first day of each of the previous 12 months, held flat for the life of the production, except where prices are defined by contractual arrangements.

Proved Undeveloped Reserves

The Company’s total estimated PUD reserves of 998 MMboe as of December 31, 2011, increased by 30 MMboe over the
968 MMboe of PUD reserves estimated at the end of 2010. During the year, Apache converted 106 MMboe of PUD reserves to proved developed reserves through development drilling activity. In North America, we converted 78 MMboe, with the remaining 28
MMboe in our international areas. We divested 12 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year primarily associated with our East Texas sales package. We acquired 6 MMboe of PUD reserves during the year. We added 179 MMboe of new PUD reserves through
extensions and discoveries and had revisions of (37) MMboe associated with changes in product prices and revised development plans.

During the year, a total of approximately $2.6 billion was spent on projects associated with reserves that were carried as PUD reserves at the end of 2010. A portion of our costs incurred each year relate
to development projects that will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years. We spent $1.4 billion on PUD reserve development activity in North America and $1.2 billion in the international areas. Other than our Julimar/Brunello
development project, which is tied to the construction schedule of the Wheatstone LNG project with projected first production in 2016, we had no material amounts of PUD reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more after they were
initially disclosed as PUD reserves and no material amounts of PUD reserves which are scheduled to be developed beyond five years from December 31, 2011.

Preparation of Oil and Gas Reserve Information

Apache emphasizes that its reported reserves are reasonably certain estimates which, by their very nature, are subject to
revision. These estimates are reviewed throughout the year and revised either upward or downward, as warranted.

Apache’s proved reserves are estimated at the property level and compiled for reporting purposes by a centralized
group of experienced reservoir engineers that is independent of the operating groups. These engineers interact with engineering and geoscience personnel in each of Apache’s operating areas and with accounting and marketing employees to obtain
the necessary data for projecting future production, costs, net revenues, and ultimate recoverable reserves. All relevant data is compiled in a computer database application, to which only authorized personnel are given security access rights
consistent with their assigned job function. Reserves are reviewed internally with senior management and presented to Apache’s Board of Directors in summary form on a quarterly basis. Annually, each property is reviewed in detail by our
centralized and operating region engineers to ensure forecasts of operating expenses, netback prices, production trends, and development timing are reasonable.







Apache’s Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering is
the person primarily responsible for overseeing the preparation of our internal reserve estimates and for coordinating any reserves audits conducted by a third-party engineering firm. He has a Bachelor of Science degree in Petroleum Engineering and
over 30 years of industry experience with positions of increasing responsibility within Apache’s corporate reservoir engineering department. The Executive Vice President of Corporate Reservoir Engineering reports directly to our Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer.

During 2011, 2010, and 2009, Ryder Scott’s review covered 81, 72, and 79
percent, respectively, of the Company’s worldwide estimated proved reserves value and 70, 63, and 69 percent, respectively, of the Company’s total proved reserves volume. Ryder Scott’s review of 2011 covered 68 percent of U.S., 69
percent of Canada, 58 percent of Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 62 percent of Egypt, and 61 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s review of 2010 covered 59 percent of U.S., 42 percent of Canada, 64 percent of
Argentina, 99 percent of Australia, 83 percent of Egypt, and 83 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves. Ryder Scott’s review of 2009 covered 66 percent of U.S., 48 percent of Canada, 63 percent of Argentina, 96 percent of Australia,
86 percent of Egypt, and 80 percent of the U.K.’s total proved reserves. We have filed Ryder Scott’s independent report as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.

According to Ryder Scott’s opinion, based on their review, including the data, technical processes, and
interpretations presented by Apache, the overall procedures and methodologies utilized by Apache in determining the proved reserves comply with the current SEC regulations, and the overall proved reserves for the reviewed properties as estimated by
Apache are, in aggregate, reasonable within the established audit tolerance guidelines as set forth in the Society of Petroleum Engineers auditing standards.

Employees

On December 31, 2011, we had 5,299
employees.

Offices

Our principal executive offices are located at One Post Oak Central, 2000 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 100, Houston, Texas 77056-4400. At year-end 2011, we maintained regional exploration and/or production
offices in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Houston, Texas; Midland, Texas; Calgary, Alberta; Cairo, Egypt; Perth, Western Australia; Aberdeen, Scotland; and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Apache leases all of its primary office space. The current lease on our principal
executive offices runs through December 31, 2018. For information regarding the Company’s obligations under its office leases, please see Part II, Item 7—Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations—Capital Resources and Liquidity—Contractual Obligations and Note 8—Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K.







Title to Interests

As is customary in our industry, a preliminary review of title records, which may include opinions or reports of
appropriate professionals or counsel, is made at the time we acquire properties. We believe that our title to all of the various interests set forth above is satisfactory and consistent with the standards generally accepted in the oil and gas
industry, subject only to immaterial exceptions that do not detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations. The interests owned by us may be subject to one or more royalty, overriding
royalty, or other outstanding interests (including disputes related to such interests) customary in the industry. The interests may additionally be subject to obligations or duties under applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, and orders of
arbitral or governmental authorities. In addition, the interests may be subject to burdens such as production payments, net profits interests, liens incident to operating agreements and current taxes, development obligations under oil and gas
leases, and other encumbrances, easements, and restrictions, none of which detract substantially from the value of the interests or materially interfere with their use in our operations.

Additional Information about Apache

In this
section, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” and “Apache” include Apache Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise specifically stated.

Remediation Plans and Procedures

Apache and its wholly owned subsidiary, Apache Deepwater LLC (ADW), adopted certain Region Spill Response Plans (the Plans) for their respective Gulf of Mexico operations to ensure rapid and effective
responses to spill events that may occur on such entities’ operated properties. Periodically, drills are conducted to measure and maintain the effectiveness of the Plans. These drills include the participation of spill response contractors,
representatives of the Clean Gulf Associates (CGA, described below), and representatives of governmental agencies. The primary association available to Apache and ADW in the event of a spill is CGA. Apache and ADW have received approval for the
Plans from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM). Apache and ADW personnel each review their respective Plan annually and update where necessary.

In the event that CGA resources are already being utilized, other associations are available to Apache. Apache is a member of Oil Spill Response Limited, which entitles any Apache entity worldwide to
access their service. Oil Spill Response Limited has access to resources from the Global Response Network, a collaboration of seven major oil industry funded spill response organizations worldwide. Oil Spill Response Limited has equipment stockpiles
in Bahrain, Singapore, and Southampton that currently include approximately 153







In 2011, ADW retained the Helix Well Containment Group
(HWCG) in conjunction with its CGA membership. HWCG is a consortium of 24 deepwater operators in the Gulf of Mexico that have worked on expanding capabilities to rapidly respond to subsea well incidents like the Deepwater Horizon incident. In June
2011, HWCG announced that it is now capable of responding to a subsea well containment incident in water depths of up to 10,000 feet. Each HWCG member company has entered into a mutual aid agreement, allowing any member to draw upon the technical
expertise and resources of the group in the event of an incident. ADW’s 2011 membership dues for the two-year service agreement were approximately $1.4 million.

Apache also participates in a number of industry-wide task forces that are
studying ways to better access and control blowouts in subsea environments and increase containment and recovery methods. Two such task forces are the Subsea Well Control and Containment Task Force and the Offshore Operating Procedures Task Force.







Competitive Conditions

The oil and gas business is highly competitive in the exploration for and acquisitions of reserves, the acquisition of
oil and gas leases, equipment and personnel required to find and produce reserves, and in the gathering and marketing of oil, gas, and natural gas liquids. Our competitors include national oil companies, major integrated oil and gas companies, other
independent oil and gas companies, and participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial, commercial, and individual consumers.

Certain of our competitors may possess financial or other resources substantially larger than we possess or have established strategic long-term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in
countries in which we may seek new entry. As a consequence, we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for leases or drilling rights.

However, we believe our diversified portfolio of core assets, which comprises large acreage positions and well-established production bases across six countries, and our balanced production mix between
oil and gas, our management and incentive systems, and our experienced personnel give us a strong competitive position relative to many of our competitors who do not possess similar political, geographic, and production diversity. Our global
position provides a large inventory of geologic and geographic opportunities in the six countries in which we have producing operations to which we can reallocate capital investments in response to changes in local business environments and markets.
It also reduces the risk that we will be materially impacted by an event in a specific area or country.

Environmental
Compliance

As an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties, we are subject to numerous
federal, provincial, state, local, and foreign country laws and regulations relating to discharge of materials into, and protection of, the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things, impose liability on the lessee under an oil
and gas lease for the cost of pollution clean-up resulting from operations, subject the lessee to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas. Although environmental requirements have a
substantial impact upon the energy industry, as a whole, we do not believe that these requirements affect us differently, to any material degree, than other companies in our industry.

We have made and will continue to make expenditures in our efforts to comply with these requirements, which we believe
are necessary business costs in the oil and gas industry. We have established policies for continuing compliance with environmental laws and regulations, including regulations applicable to our operations in all countries in which we do business. We
have established operating procedures and training programs designed to limit the environmental impact of our field facilities and identify and comply with changes in existing laws and regulations. The costs incurred under these policies and
procedures are inextricably connected to normal operating expenses such that we are unable to separate expenses related to environmental matters; however, we do not believe expenses related to training and compliance with regulations and laws that
have been adopted or enacted to regulate the discharge of materials into the environment will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position.

Changes to existing, or additions of, laws, regulations, enforcement policies or requirements in one or more of the
countries or regions in which we operate could require us to make additional capital expenditures. While the events in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010 have resulted in the enactment of, and may result in the enactment of additional, laws or
requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, we do not believe that any such regulations or laws enacted or adopted as of this date will have a material adverse impact on our cost of operations, earnings, or competitive
position.
