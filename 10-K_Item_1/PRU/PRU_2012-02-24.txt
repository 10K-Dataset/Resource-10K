ITEM 1.BUSINESS



Overview



Prudential Financial, Inc., a financial services leader with approximately $901 billion of assets under management as of December 31,
2011, has operations in the United States, Asia, Europe and Latin America. Through our subsidiaries and affiliates, we offer a wide array of financial products and services, including life insurance, annuities, retirement-related services, mutual
funds and investment management. We offer these products and services to individual and institutional customers through proprietary and third party distribution networks. Our principal executive offices are located in Newark, New Jersey.



The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into the
Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business. The Financial Services Businesses comprises our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division, and International Insurance
division as well as our Corporate and Other operations. The Closed Block Business comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block described below and certain related assets and liabilities.



We maintain diversified investment portfolios in our
insurance companies to support our liabilities to customers in our Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, as well as our other general liabilities. Our investment portfolio consists of public and private fixed maturity
securities, commercial mortgage and other loans, equity securities and other invested assets. As of December 31, 2011, the general account investment portfolio totaled $278.5 billion for the Financial Services Businesses and $66.8 billion for
the Closed Block Business. For additional information on our investment portfolio see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account
Investments—General Account Investments” and Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Prudential Financial has two classes of common stock outstanding. The Common Stock, which is publicly traded (NYSE:PRU), reflects the
performance of the Financial Services Businesses, while the Class B Stock, which was issued through a private placement and does not trade on any exchange, reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business.



Demutualization and Separation of the Businesses



Demutualization



On December 18, 2001, our date of demutualization,
Prudential Insurance converted from a mutual life insurance company owned by its policyholders to a stock life insurance company and became an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. The demutualization was carried out under
Prudential Insurance’s Plan of Reorganization, dated as of December 15, 2000, as amended, which we refer to as the Plan of Reorganization. On the date of demutualization, eligible policyholders, as defined in the Plan of Reorganization,
received shares of Prudential Financial’s Common Stock or the right to receive cash or policy credits, which are increases in policy values or increases in other policy benefits, upon the extinguishment of all membership interests in Prudential
Insurance.







On the date of demutualization, Prudential Financial completed an initial public offering of
its Common Stock, as well as the sale of shares of Class B Stock, a separate class of common stock, through a private placement. In addition, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial
that owns the capital stock of Prudential Insurance, issued $1.75 billion in senior secured notes, which we refer to as the IHC debt. A portion of the IHC debt was insured by a bond insurer. Concurrent with the demutualization, various subsidiaries
of Prudential Insurance were reorganized, becoming direct or indirect subsidiaries of Prudential Financial.



The Plan of Reorganization required us to establish and operate a regulatory mechanism known as the Closed Block. The Closed Block is
designed generally to provide for the reasonable expectations of holders of participating individual life insurance policies and annuities included in the Closed Block for future policy dividends after demutualization by allocating assets that will
be used for payment of benefits, including policyholder dividends, on these policies. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on the Closed Block. The Plan of Reorganization provided that Prudential Insurance may,
with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, enter into agreements to transfer to a third party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. The long-term risks associated with the policies in the
Closed Block are 90% reinsured, including 7% by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. In 2011, we also reinsured 90% of the short-term risks associated with the Closed Block policies to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information on the Closed Block reinsurance arrangements.



Separation of the Businesses



The businesses of Prudential Financial are separated into
the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business for financial statement purposes. For a discussion of the operating results of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, see “Management’s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” The Financial Services Businesses comprises our U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division, U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division, and International
Insurance division as well as our Corporate and Other operations. See “—Financial Services Businesses” below for a more detailed discussion of the divisions comprising the Financial Services Businesses. The Closed Block Business
comprises the assets and related liabilities of the Closed Block and certain other assets and liabilities, including the IHC debt. See “—Closed Block Business” below for additional discussion of the Closed Block Business. We refer to
the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business collectively as the Businesses.



The following diagram reflects the allocation of Prudential Financial’s consolidated assets and liabilities between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business:











There is no legal separation of the two Businesses. The foregoing allocation of assets and
liabilities does not require Prudential Financial, Prudential Insurance, any of their subsidiaries or the Closed Block to transfer any specific assets or liabilities to a separate legal entity. Financial results of the Closed Block Business,
including debt service on the IHC debt, will affect Prudential Financial’s consolidated results of operations, financial position and borrowing costs. In addition, any net losses of the Closed Block Business, and any dividends or distributions
on, or repurchases of, the Class B Stock, will reduce the assets of Prudential Financial legally available for dividends on the Common Stock. Accordingly, you should read the financial information for the Financial Services Businesses together with
the consolidated financial information of Prudential Financial.



The Common Stock reflects the performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Class B Stock reflects the performance of the Closed Block Business. However, the market value of the Common Stock
may not reflect solely the performance of the Financial Services Businesses.



In order to separately reflect the financial performance of the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business since the date of demutualization, we have allocated all our assets and
liabilities and earnings between the two Businesses, and we account for them as if they were separate legal entities. All assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries not included in the Closed Block Business constitute the
assets and liabilities of the Financial Services Businesses. Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that Business. The Closed Block Business consists principally of:



•within Prudential Insurance, the Closed Block Assets, Surplus and Related Assets (see below), deferred policy acquisition costs and other assets in
respect of the policies included in the Closed Block and, with respect to liabilities, the Closed Block Liabilities;



•within Prudential Holdings, LLC, the principal amount of the IHC debt, related unamortized debt issuance costs and hedging activities, and a guaranteed
investment contract; and



•within Prudential Financial, dividends received from Prudential Holdings, LLC, and reinvestment proceeds thereof, and other liabilities of Prudential
Financial, in each case attributable to the Closed Block Business.





On the date of demutualization, the majority of the net
proceeds from the issuances of the Class B Stock and the IHC debt was allocated to our Financial Services Businesses. Also, on the date of demutualization, Prudential Holdings, LLC distributed $1.218 billion of the net proceeds of the IHC debt to
Prudential Financial to use for general corporate purposes in the Financial Services Businesses. Prudential Holdings, LLC deposited $437 million of the net proceeds of the IHC debt in a debt service coverage account maintained in the Financial
Services Businesses that, together with reinvested earnings thereon, constitutes a source of payment and security for the IHC debt. The remainder of the net proceeds, $72 million, was used to purchase a guaranteed investment contract to fund a
portion of the bond insurance related to the IHC debt. To the extent we use the debt service coverage account to service payments with respect to the IHC debt or to pay dividends to Prudential Financial for purposes of the Closed Block Business, a
loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block







Business would be established. Such an inter-business loan would be repaid by the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses when earnings from the Closed Block Business replenish
funds in the debt service coverage account to a specified level. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the IHC debt and the debt service coverage account.



We believe that the proceeds from the issuances of the Class
B Stock and IHC debt allocated to the Financial Services Businesses reflected capital in excess of that necessary to support the Closed Block Business and that the Closed Block Business as established has sufficient assets and cash flows to service
the IHC debt. The Closed Block Business was financially leveraged through the issuance of the IHC debt, and dividends on the Class B Stock are subject to prior servicing of the IHC debt. It is expected that any inter-business loan referred to above
will be repaid in full out of the Surplus and Related Assets, but not the Closed Block Assets. Any such loan will be subordinated to the IHC debt.



The Financial Services Businesses will bear any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and, as
discussed below, the consequences of certain potential adverse tax determinations. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we agreed to indemnify the investors in those securities with respect to certain matters, and any cost
of that indemnification would be borne by the Financial Services Businesses.



Within the Closed Block Business, the assets and cash flows attributable to the Closed Block accrue solely to the benefit of the Closed Block policyholders through policyholder dividends after payment of
benefits, expenses and taxes. The Surplus and Related Assets accrue to the benefit of the holders of Class B Stock. The earnings on, and distribution of, the Surplus and Related Assets over time will be the source or measure of payment of the
interest and principal of the IHC debt and of dividends on the Class B Stock. The earnings of the Closed Block are reported as part of the Closed Block Business, although no cash flows or assets of the Closed Block accrue to the benefit of the
holders of Common Stock or Class B Stock. The Closed Block Assets are not available to service interest or principal of the IHC debt or dividends on the Class B Stock.



Inter-Business Transfers and Allocation Policies



Prudential Financial’s Board of Directors has adopted
certain policies with respect to inter-business transfers and accounting and tax matters, including the allocation of earnings. Such policies are summarized below. In the future, the Board of Directors may modify, rescind or add to any of these
policies. However, the decision of the Board of Directors to modify, rescind or add to any of these policies is subject to the Board of Directors’ general fiduciary duties. In addition, we have agreed with the investors in the Class B Stock and
the insurer of the IHC debt that, in most instances, the Board of Directors may not change these policies without their consent.



Inter-Business Transactions and Transfers



The transactions permitted between the Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business, subject to any required regulatory
approvals and the contractual limitations noted above, include the following:



•The Closed Block Business may lend to the Financial Services Businesses, and the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business,
in each case on terms no less favorable to the Closed Block Business than comparable internal loans and only for cash management purposes in the ordinary course of business and on market terms pursuant to our internal short-term cash management
facility.



•Other transactions between the Closed Block and businesses outside of the Closed Block, including the Financial Services Businesses, are permitted if,
among other things, such transactions benefit the Closed Block, are at fair market value and do not exceed, in any calendar year, a specified formula amount.



•Capital contributions to Prudential Insurance may be for the benefit of either the Financial Services Businesses or the Closed Block Business and
assets of the Financial Services Businesses within Prudential Insurance may be transferred to the Closed Block Business within Prudential Insurance in the form of a loan which is subordinated to all existing obligations of the Closed Block Business
and on market terms.







•An inter-business loan from the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block Business may be established to reflect usage of the net proceeds of
the IHC debt initially deposited in the debt service coverage account, and any reinvested earnings thereon, to pay debt service on the IHC debt or dividends to Prudential Financial for purposes of the Closed Block Business.



•In addition to the foregoing, the Financial Services Businesses may lend to the Closed Block Business, on either a subordinated or non-subordinated
basis, on market terms as may be approved by Prudential Financial.



•The Financial Services Businesses and the Closed Block Business may engage in such other transactions on market terms as may be approved by Prudential
Financial and, if applicable, Prudential Insurance.



•The Board of Directors has discretion to transfer assets of the Financial Services Businesses to the Closed Block, or use such assets for the benefit
of Closed Block policyholders, if it believes such transfer or usage is in the best interests of the Financial Services Businesses, and such transfer or usage may be made without requiring any repayment of the amounts transferred or used or the
payment of any other consideration from the Closed Block Business.



•Cash payments for administrative purposes from the Closed Block Business to the Financial Services Businesses are based on formulas that initially
approximated the actual expenses incurred by the Financial Services Businesses to provide such services based on insurance and policies in force and statutory cash premiums. Administrative expenses recorded by the Closed Block Business, and the
related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP, utilizing the Company’s methodology for the allocation of such expenses. Any difference in the cash
amount transferred and actual expenses incurred as reported under U.S. GAAP will be recorded, on an after-tax basis at the applicable current rate, as direct adjustments to the respective equity balances of the Closed Block Business and the
Financial Services Businesses, without the issuance of shares of either Business to the other Business. This direct equity adjustment modifies earnings available to each class of common stock for earnings per share purposes. Internal investment
expenses recorded and paid by the Closed Block Business, and the related income tax effect, are based upon actual expenses incurred under U.S. GAAP and in accordance with internal arrangements governing recordkeeping, bank fees, accounting and
reporting, asset allocation, investment policy and planning and analysis.



Accounting Policies



Accounting policies relating to the allocation of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses between the two Businesses include:



•All assets, liabilities, equity and earnings are allocated between the two Businesses and accounted for as if the Businesses were separate legal
entities. Assets and liabilities allocated to the Closed Block Business are those that we consider appropriate to operate that Business. All remaining assets and liabilities of Prudential Financial and its subsidiaries constitute the assets and
liabilities of the Financial Services Businesses.



•For financial reporting purposes, revenues; administrative, overhead and investment expenses; taxes other than federal income taxes; and certain
commissions and commission-related expenses associated with the Closed Block Business are allocated between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Interest expense and routine maintenance and
administrative costs generated by the IHC debt are considered directly attributable to the Closed Block Business and are therefore allocated to the Closed Block Business, except as indicated below.



•Any transfers of funds between the Closed Block Business and the Financial Services Businesses will typically be accounted for as either reimbursement
of expense, investment income, return of principal or a subordinated loan, except as described under “—Inter-Business Transactions and Transfers” above.



•The Financial Services Businesses will bear any expenses and liabilities from litigation affecting the Closed Block Policies and the consequences of
certain potential adverse tax determinations noted below. In connection with the sale of the Class B Stock and IHC debt, we agreed to indemnify the investors with respect to certain matters, and any such indemnification would be borne by the
Financial Services Businesses.







Tax Allocation and Tax Treatment



The Closed Block Business within each legal entity is
treated as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial. Accordingly, if the Closed Block Business has taxable income, it recognizes its share of income tax as if it were a consolidated subsidiary of Prudential Financial. If the
Closed Block Business has losses or credits, it recognizes a current income tax benefit.







Internal
Short-Term Cash Management Facilities



The
Financial Services Businesses and Closed Block Business participate in separate internal short-term cash management facilities, pursuant to which they invest cash from securities lending and repurchase activities as well as certain trading and
operating activities. The net funds invested in the facilities are generally held in investments that are short-term, including mortgage- and asset-backed securities. Each Business holds discrete ownership of its investments in separate facilities
without affecting or being affected by the level of participation of the other Business.



Financial Services Businesses



The Financial Services Businesses are comprised of three divisions, containing six segments, and our Corporate and Other operations. The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division is
comprised of the Individual Annuities, Retirement and Asset Management segments. The U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division is comprised of the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments. The International Insurance division is
comprised of the International Insurance segment.







See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and
total assets by segment of the Financial Services Businesses.



U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division



The U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division conducts its business through the Individual Annuities, Retirement and
Asset Management segments.



Individual Annuities



Our Individual Annuities segment
manufactures and distributes individual variable and fixed annuity products, primarily to the U.S. mass affluent market. In general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent in the U.S.
market. Our focus on innovative product design coupled with our risk management strategies, as discussed below, has contributed to growth in our business in recent years and a reduced risk profile. Our annuity products are distributed through a
diverse group of independent financial planners, wirehouses, banks, and insurance agents, including Prudential Agents and the agency distribution force of The Allstate Corporation, or Allstate.



Competition



The Individual Annuities segment competes with other
providers of retirement savings and accumulation products, including other large, well-established insurance and financial services companies. We compete in the individual annuities business primarily based on our ability to offer innovative product
features. Our risk management strategy allows us to offer these features and helps to hedge or limit our exposure to certain of the related risks, utilizing a combination of product design elements, such as an automatic rebalancing element, also
referred to as an asset transfer feature, and externally purchased hedging instruments. The automatic rebalancing element, included in the design of certain optional living benefits, transfers assets between certain variable investments selected by
the annuity contractholder and investments that are expected to be more stable (e.g., a separate account bond portfolio or fixed-rate account), according to a static mathematical formula as discussed in more detail below. By transferring assets to
the more stable investment, the automatic rebalancing element helps to reduce our risk associated with the optional living benefit.



In recent years, we benefited from the impact of market disruptions on some of our competitors, certain of which either exited the
variable annuity marketplace or implemented product modifications to increase pricing and scale back product features. However, in 2011 we implemented modifications to scale back benefits and increase pricing for certain product features, while
certain of our competitors became more aggressive in product design and pricing. We believe our current product offerings remain competitively positioned and that our differentiated risk management strategies will continue to provide us with an
attractive risk and profitability profile, as all currently-offered optional living benefit features include the automatic rebalancing element and most sales include a lifetime income withdrawal feature utilizing a notional amount based on a highest
daily contract value plus a minimum return, credited for a period of time, as described below. Our automatic rebalancing element occurs at the contractholder level, rather than at the fund level, which we believe enhances our risk management
capabilities. In addition to our product features, we also compete based on brand recognition, the breadth of our distribution platform and our customer service capabilities.



Products



We offer variable annuities that provide our customers with
tax-deferred asset accumulation together with a base death benefit and a suite of optional guaranteed death and living benefits. The benefit features contractually guarantee the contractholder a return of no less than (1) total deposits made to
the contract less any partial withdrawals (“return of net deposits”), (2) total deposits made to the contract less any partial withdrawals plus a minimum return (“minimum return”), and/or (3) the highest contract value
on a specified date minus any withdrawals (“contract value”). These guarantees may include benefits that are payable in the event of death, annuitization or at specified dates during the accumulation period and withdrawal and income
benefits payable







during specified periods. Our latest optional living benefits guarantee, among other features, the ability to make withdrawals based on the highest daily contract value plus a minimum return,
credited for a period of time. This highest daily guaranteed contract value is a notional amount that forms the basis for determination of periodic withdrawals for the life of the contractholder, and cannot be accessed as a lump-sum surrender value.



Our variable annuity investment options provide
our customers with the opportunity to invest in proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds, frequently under asset allocation programs, and fixed-rate accounts. The investments made by customers in the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds
generally represent separate account interests that provide a return linked to an underlying investment portfolio. The general account investments made in the fixed-rate accounts are credited with interest at rates we determine, subject to certain
minimums. We also offer fixed annuities that provide a guarantee of principal and interest credited at rates we determine, subject to certain contractual minimums. Certain investments made in the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities and
certain fixed annuities impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is not held to maturity. Based on the contractual terms, the market value adjustment can be positive, resulting in an additional amount for the contractholder, or
negative, resulting in a deduction from the contractholder’s account value or redemption proceeds.



The primary risk exposures of our variable annuity contracts relate to actual deviations from, or changes to, the assumptions used in the
original pricing of these products, including equity market returns, interest rates, market volatility, timing of annuitization and withdrawals, contract lapses and contractholder mortality. The rate of return we realize from our variable annuity
contracts will vary based on the extent of the differences between our actual experience and the assumptions used in the original pricing of these products. As part of our risk management strategy, we hedge or limit our exposure to certain of these
risks primarily through a combination of product design elements, such as the automatic rebalancing element, and externally purchased hedging instruments. Our returns can also vary by contract based on our risk management strategy, including the
impact of any capital markets movements that we may hedge, the impact on that portion of our variable annuity contracts that benefit from the automatic rebalancing element, the impact of risks we have deemed suitable to retain and the impact of
risks that are not able to be hedged.





As mentioned above, in addition to our automatic rebalancing element, we also manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity
products through our hedging programs. In our living benefit hedging program, we purchase interest rate swaps, swaptions, floors and caps as well as equity options and futures to hedge certain optional living benefit features accounted for as
embedded derivatives against changes in certain capital market assumptions such as interest rates, equity markets and market volatility. Historically, our hedging











Marketing and Distribution



Prudential Agents



Our Prudential Agents distribute variable annuities with proprietary and non-proprietary investment options, as well as fixed annuities. For additional information regarding our Prudential Agent force,
see “—U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division—Individual Life.”



Third Party Distribution



Our individual annuity products are also offered through a variety of third party channels, including independent brokers, wirehouses, banks, and Allstate’s proprietary distribution force. Our
distribution efforts are supported by a network of 317 internal and external wholesalers as of December 31, 2011.



Underwriting and Pricing



We earn asset management and other fees determined as a percentage of the average assets of the proprietary mutual funds in our variable
annuity products, net of subadvisory expenses. Additionally, we earn mortality and expense fees and other fees for various insurance-related options and features, including optional







guaranteed death and living benefit features, based on the average daily net asset value of the annuity separate accounts or the amount of guaranteed value under the optional living benefit, as
applicable. We also receive administrative service fees from many of the proprietary and non-proprietary mutual funds.



We price our variable annuities, including optional guaranteed death and living benefits, based on an evaluation of the risks assumed and
considering applicable hedging costs. Our pricing is also influenced by competition, and by assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, including persistency, and benefit utilization and withdrawal rates for contracts with living benefit features,
as well as other assumptions. Significant deviations in actual experience from our pricing assumptions could have an adverse effect on the profitability of our products. To encourage persistency, most of our variable and fixed annuities have
surrender or withdrawal charges for a specified number of years. In addition, the living benefit features of our variable annuity products encourage persistency because the potential value of the living benefit is fully realized only if the contract
persists.



We price our fixed annuities as well as
the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities based on assumptions as to investment returns, expenses, competition and persistency. We seek to maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit
on our fixed annuities and the fixed-rate accounts of our variable annuities. For assets transferred to a fixed-rate account in the general account pursuant to the automatic rebalancing element discussed above, we earn a spread for the difference
between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest credited, similar to our fixed annuities.



Reserves



We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future
obligations for our in force annuity contracts, including the death benefit and living benefit guarantee features associated with some of these contracts. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield,
persistency, expenses, withdrawal rates and mortality rates. Certain of the living benefit guarantee features on variable annuity contracts are accounted for as embedded derivatives and are carried at fair value. The fair values of these benefit
features are calculated as the present value of future expected benefit payments to customers less the present value of assessed rider fees attributable to the embedded derivative feature, and are based on management’s expectation of how a
market participant would value these embedded derivative liabilities. For variable and fixed annuity contracts, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus credited interest
and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, and all applicable mortality and expense charges.



Retirement



Our Retirement segment, which we refer to in the marketplace as Prudential Retirement, provides retirement investment and income products and services to retirement plan sponsors in the public, private,
and not-for-profit sectors. Our full service business provides recordkeeping, plan administration, actuarial advisory services, tailored participant education and communication services, trustee services and institutional and retail investments. We
service defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified plans. For clients with combinations of defined contribution, defined benefit and non-qualified plans, we offer integrated recordkeeping services. For participants leaving our
clients’ plans, we provide a broad range of rollover products through our broker-dealer, Prudential Investment Management Services LLC, our bank, Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB (“PB&T”), and certain of our insurance
companies. In 2012, PB&T intends to limit its operations to trust services. This will allow Prudential Financial to deregister as a savings and loan holding company prior to the effectiveness of the “Volcker Rule” provision of the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act on July 21, 2012. For more information on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, see “—Regulation—Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act.”



Our institutional
investment products business offers investment-only stable value products, guaranteed investment contracts, or GICs, funding agreements, institutional and retail notes, structured settlement annuities, and group annuities, for defined contribution
plans, defined benefit plans, non-qualified plans, and individuals. Results of our institutional investment products business include proprietary spread lending activities where we borrow on a secured or unsecured basis to support investments on
which we earn a spread between the asset yield







and liability cost. We also offer products that provide pension risk transfer solutions, as pension plan sponsors seek to manage their exposure to risk. This is an emerging market that we
recently entered and believe we are well-positioned to provide innovative solutions to pension plan sponsors.



In recent years we have completed two acquisitions which have increased our scale, expanded our sales and distribution capabilities and
broadened our array of product and service offerings in our full service business.



Union Bank of California’s Retirement Business



On December 31, 2007, we acquired a portion of the retirement business of Union Bank of California, N.A. for $103 million of cash
consideration. This acquisition increased the scale of our product and service offerings and expanded our sales and distribution capabilities on the west coast of the U.S. The integration of this business was completed in 2008.



MullinTBG



On October 10, 2008, we acquired MullinTBG Insurance
Agency Services, LLC and related entities, or MullinTBG, a provider of executive benefit solutions and financing strategies, including administration of non-qualified executive benefit plans. This acquisition broadened our array of product
offerings, expanded our sales and distribution capabilities and enhanced our position as a single source servicer of both qualified and non-qualified retirement and deferred compensation plans.



Competition



The Retirement segment competes with other large,
well-established insurance companies, asset managers, recordkeepers and diversified financial institutions. In our full service business, we compete primarily based on pricing, the breadth of our service and investment offerings, investment
performance, and our ability to offer product features to meet the retirement income needs of our clients. We have seen a trend towards unbundling of the purchase decision related to the recordkeeping and investment offerings, where the variety and
flexibility of available funds and their performance are key selection criteria to plan sponsors and intermediaries. Additionally, changes in the regulatory environment have driven more transparent fee disclosures, which have heightened pricing
pressures and may accelerate the trend toward unbundling of services. In recent years, there has been consolidation among industry providers seeking to increase scale, improve cost efficiencies, and enter new market segments. However, the market
remains competitive with few dominant players. Despite the competitive landscape, we have seen case turnover slowing in our mid to large case target markets.



In our institutional investment products business, we compete primarily based on our pricing and structuring capabilities, which are
supported by the financial strength ratings of our U.S. insurance companies. Sales of institutional investment products are affected by competitive factors such as investment performance, company credit and financial strength ratings, product
design, marketplace visibility, distribution capabilities, fees, crediting rates, and customer service. In recent years, market disruptions and rating agency downgrades have caused some of our competitors to withdraw from the institutional market. A
continuing lack of supply to the stable value wrap market has created a significant growth opportunity, which has resulted in a material increase in this business activity.



Products and Services



Full Service



Our full service business offers plan sponsors and their
participants a broad range of products and services to assist in the delivery and administration of defined contribution, defined benefit, and non-qualified plans, including recordkeeping and administrative services, comprehensive investment
offerings and consulting services to assist plan sponsors in managing fiduciary obligations. As part of our investment products, we offer a variety of general and separate account stable value products and other fee-based separate accounts, as well
as retail mutual funds and institutional funds advised by affiliated and non-affiliated investment managers. In addition, certain products that are designed for the benefit of participants are marketed and sold on an







investment-only basis through our full service distribution channels. Revenue is generated from asset-based fees, as well as recordkeeping and other advisory fees. For certain stable value
products discussed below, profits result from the spread between the rate of return on investments we earn and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. In connection with non-qualified retirement and deferred compensation plans, we earn
recordkeeping fees and commissions on products sold to finance the sponsor’s plan liability. Prudential Financial’s asset management units earn fees from managing assets supporting retirement products, including assets within the general
account and those in separate accounts if selected by our clients as the asset manager.



Our full service general account and separate account stable value products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate for a specific period of time and to repay account balances or market
value upon contract termination. These stable value products are either fully or partially participating, with annual or semi-annual rate resets giving effect to previous investment experience. We earn administrative fees for providing recordkeeping
and other administrative services for these products. In addition, we earn profits from partially participating products from the spread between the rate of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. The
amount of profit we earn is impacted by the levels of interest rates, the pace and extent of changes in interest rates, competitor pricing and the minimum guaranteed crediting rates on these products.



We also offer fee-based separate account products, through
which customer funds are held in a separate account, retail mutual funds, institutional funds, or a client-owned trust. These products generally pass all of the investment results to the customer. In certain cases, these contracts are subject to a
minimum interest rate guarantee backed by the general account. Additionally, we offer guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefits associated with certain defined contribution accounts, and hedge certain of the related risks utilizing externally purchased
hedging instruments.



Our full service fee-based
advisory offerings are supported by participant communications and education programs, and a broad range of plan consulting services, including non-discrimination testing, plan document services, signature-ready documents for required filings, and
full actuarial support for defined benefit plans. Additional services include non-qualified deferred compensation plan administration, including executive benefit solutions and financing strategies, investment advisory services, and merger and
acquisition support.



We also offer a broad range
of rollover solutions, including individual retirement accounts, mutual funds, and guaranteed income products. Our rollover products and services are marketed to participants who terminate or retire from organizations that are clients of our
retirement plan recordkeeping services. As noted above, in 2012, PB&T intends to limit its product offerings to trust services.



Institutional Investment Products



Our institutional investment products business primarily offers products to the stable value and payout annuity markets. In addition to
the sources of earnings discussed below, Prudential Financial’s asset management units earn fees from managing assets supporting retirement products, including assets within the general account and those in separate accounts if selected by our
clients as the asset manager.



Stable Value
Markets.Our stable value markets area manufactures investment-only products for use in retail and institutional capital markets and qualified plan markets. Our primary stable value product offerings are investment-only
wraps through which customers’ funds are held in a client-owned trust. These are participating contracts for which we pass investment results through to the customer, subject to a minimum interest rate guarantee backed by the general account,
and earn fees for providing this guarantee. For contracts currently in force, the minimum interest rate is floored at zero. The fees we earn for providing this guarantee may be reset as defined by the underlying contracts. Contractholders are
provided with flexible fund investment alternatives, and assets may be managed by Prudential Financial’s asset management unit or third party asset managers.



We also offer investment-only general account products in the
form of GICs, funding agreements, retail notes and institutional notes. These products contain an obligation to pay interest at a specified rate and to repay principal at maturity or following contract termination. Because these obligations are
backed by our general account, we bear the investment and asset/liability management risk associated with these contracts. Generally,







profits from our general account products result from the spread between the rate of return we earn on the investments and the interest rates we credit, less expenses. The credited interest rates
we offer and the volume of issuance are impacted by many factors, including the financial strength ratings of our U.S. insurance companies, overall market conditions, and other competitive factors. Due to current economic conditions, recent maturing
contracts have outpaced new issuances.



Payout
Annuity Markets.Our payout annuity markets area offers traditional general and separate account products designed to provide a predictable source of monthly income, generally for the life of the participant, such as
structured settlements, voluntary income products and close-out annuities, which fulfill the payment guarantee needs of the personal injury lawsuit settlement market, the distribution needs of defined contribution participants and the payment
obligations of defined benefit plans, respectively. With our general account products, the obligation to make annuity payments to our annuitants is backed by our general account assets, and we bear all of the investment, mortality, retirement,
asset/liability management, and expense risk associated with these contracts. Our profits from structured settlements, voluntary income products and close-out annuities result from the emerging experience related to investment returns, timing of
mortality, timing of retirement, and the level of expenses being more or less favorable than assumed in the original pricing. The volume of issuance of these products is impacted by many factors, including the financial strength ratings of our U.S.
insurance companies.



We also provide both
participating and non-participating separate account annuity contracts. Our participating separate account annuity contracts are fee-based products that cover payments to retirees to be made by defined benefit plans. These contracts permit a plan
sponsor to retain the risks and rewards of investment and actuarial results while receiving a general account guarantee for all annuity payments covered by the contract. Our non-participating separate account annuity contracts provide pension
benefit guarantees to defined benefit plan participants, and have economic features similar to our general account annuity contracts, discussed above, but offer the added protection of an insulated separate account.



We issue close-out annuities to defined benefit pension
plans. In 2011, we expanded our pension risk transfer product offerings with the introduction of portfolio-protected products and a longevity reinsurance product. Our portfolio-protected products are non-participating separate account group annuity
contracts in which we assume from plan sponsors all of the investment and actuarial risk associated with a group of specified participants within a plan. These products have economic features similar to our general account annuity contracts,
discussed above, but offer the added protection of an insulated separate account. Our longevity reinsurance product is a reinsurance contract from which we earn a fee for assuming the longevity risk of pension plans that have been insured by
third-parties.



During 2011, we issued several
close-out annuities, including portfolio-protected products, to smaller U.S. plans. We believe that larger U.S. pension plans are actively exploring risk transfer transactions, in part because of the increasingly stringent funding requirements
imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. If larger U.S. plans decide to purchase our pension risk transfer products, the size and scale of such risk transfers may significantly expand the size of our existing payout annuity business.



Marketing and Distribution



We distribute our products through a variety of channels. In
our full service business, our dedicated sales and support teams manage our distribution efforts in offices across the country. We sell our products and services through third-party financial advisors, brokers, and benefits consultants and, to a
lesser extent, directly to plan sponsors. We market our rollover IRA products and services to plan participants through a centralized service team.



In our stable value markets area within our institutional investment products business, we distribute traditional GICs and investment-only
stable value wraps to plan sponsors and stable value fund managers through our direct sales force and through intermediaries. Also within our institutional investment products business, our capital markets group manages a global Funding Agreement
Notes Issuance Program, or FANIP, pursuant to which a statutory trust issues medium-term notes secured by funding agreements issued to the trust by Prudential Insurance. The medium-term notes are sold to institutional investors through
intermediaries under Rule 144A and







Regulation S of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (“Securities Act”). In addition, a portion of Prudential Financial’s SEC-registered medium-term notes program is allocated
for sales to retail investors. The proceeds from the sale of the retail notes may be used by Prudential Financial to purchase funding agreements from Prudential Insurance. Proceeds from the retail notes may also be used for general corporate
purposes. The capital markets group also distributes funding agreements to institutional investors through our direct sales force and through intermediaries. In February 2009, Prudential Insurance also began issuing funding agreements directly to
the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York.



In our
payout annuity markets area within our institutional investment products business, structured settlements are distributed through structured settlement specialists. Voluntary income products are distributed through the defined contribution portion
of our full service business, directly to plan sponsors, or as part of annuity shopping services. Close-out annuities and participating separate account annuity products are typically distributed through actuarial consultants and third-party
brokers.



Underwriting and Pricing



We set our rates for our stable value products within our
full service and institutional investment products businesses using pricing models that consider the investment environment and our risk, expense and profitability assumptions. In addition, for products within our payout annuity markets area, our
models also use assumptions for mortality and early retirement risks. These assumptions may be less predictable in emerging markets, such as the longevity reinsurance market, and significant deviations in actual experience from pricing assumptions
could affect the profitability of these products.



Upon sale of certain payout annuity and capital market products within the institutional investment products business, we adjust the
duration of our asset portfolio and lock in the prevailing interest rates. Management continuously monitors cash flow experience and works closely with our Asset Liability Management and Risk Management groups to review performance and ensure
compliance with our investment policies. We seek to mitigate interest rate risks, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment, with thorough underwriting, pricing and active asset/liability matching portfolio
management.



For our investment-only stable value
wrap product, our pricing risk is mitigated by the fact that the fees we earn for providing a guaranteed rate of return may be reset, as defined by the underlying contracts. Additionally, the contracts allow participants to withdraw funds at book
value, while contractholder withdrawals occur at market value immediately or at book value over time.



Reserves



We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for our in force annuity products. We base these reserves
on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, expenses, mortality rates, retirement age and other behavioral assumptions, as well as margins for adverse deviation as appropriate. For accumulation products, we establish
liabilities for policyholders’ account balances and additional reserves for investment experience that will accrue to the customer but have not yet been reflected in credited rates.



Asset Management



The Asset Management segment provides a broad array of investment management and advisory services by means of institutional portfolio
management, mutual funds, asset securitization activity and other structured products, and strategic investments. These products and services are provided to the public and private marketplace, as well as our U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance
division, International Insurance division and Individual Annuities and Retirement segments, as well as the Closed Block Business.



We earn asset management fees which are typically based upon a percentage of assets under management. In certain asset management fee
arrangements, we also receive performance-based incentive fees when the return on assets under management exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets. Transaction fees







are earned as a percentage of the transaction price associated with the sale or purchase of assets in certain funds, primarily related to real estate. In addition, we earn investment results from
strategic investing and revenues from commercial mortgage origination and servicing.



Competition



The Asset Management segment competes with numerous asset managers and other financial institutions. In the markets for our asset management products, we compete based on a number of factors, including
investment performance, investment philosophy and process, talent, organizational stability and the client relationship. We offer products across multiple asset classes, with specialized investment teams that employ proven approaches designed to add
value in each product area or asset class. The combination of organizational stability and robust institutional and retail businesses has helped attract and retain talent critical to delivering investment results for clients. Our private placement
and commercial mortgage businesses compete based on price, terms, execution and the strength of our relationship with the borrower. The competition will vary depending on the product or service being offered.



Products and Services



In our asset management areas, we offer the following
products and services:



Public Fixed Income
Asset Management



Our public fixed income
organization manages fixed income portfolios for U.S. and international, institutional and retail clients, as well as for our general account. Our products include traditional broad market fixed income strategies and single-sector strategies. We
manage traditional asset-liability strategies, as well as customized asset-liability strategies. We also manage hedge strategies, as well as collateralized loan obligations. We also serve as a non-custodial securities lending agent.



Portfolios are managed by seasoned portfolio managers
across six sector specialist teams: Corporate, Leveraged Finance, Emerging Markets, Global Rates and Securitized Products, Municipals and Money Markets. A separate team is dedicated to securities lending activities. All strategies are managed using
a research-based approach, supported by significant credit research, quantitative research, and risk management organizations.



Public Equity Asset Management



Our public equity organization provides discretionary and non-discretionary asset management services to a wide range of clients. We
manage a broad array of publicly-traded equity asset classes using various investment styles. The public equity organization is comprised of two wholly-owned registered investment advisors, Jennison Associates LLC and Quantitative Management
Associates LLC. Jennison Associates uses fundamental, team-based research to manage portfolios for institutional and private clients through separately-managed accounts and commingled vehicles, including mutual funds through subadvisory
relationships. Jennison Associates also manages fixed income portfolios for institutional clients through discretionary accounts and commingled vehicles, including mutual funds through subadvisory relationships. Quantitative Management Associates
manages equity and asset allocation portfolios for institutional and subadvisory clients, including mutual funds, using proprietary quantitative models tailored to meet client objectives.



Private Fixed Income Asset Management



Our private fixed income organization provides asset management services by investing in private placement
investment grade debt, private placement below investment grade debt, and mezzanine debt securities. These investment capabilities are utilized by our general account and institutional clients through direct advisory accounts, insurance company
separate accounts, and private fund structures. A majority of the private placement investments are directly originated by our investment staff.







Commercial Mortgage Origination and Servicing



Our commercial mortgage operations provide mortgage
origination, asset management and servicing for our general account, institutional clients, and government-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae, the Federal Housing Administration, and Freddie Mac, and beginning in 2011, as a minority interest
joint venture partner and service provider to originate commercial mortgages for future securitization. Through the third quarter of 2008, we had originated shorter-term interim loans for spread lending that are collateralized by assets generally
under renovation or lease up. Due to unfavorable market conditions experienced at that time and the inherent risk of these loans, we suspended the origination of interim loans. Our interim loans are generally paid off through refinancing or the sale
by the borrower of the underlying collateral. These loans are inherently more risky than those collateralized by properties that have already stabilized. As of December 31, 2011, the principal balance of interim loans totaled $648 million.



Real Estate Asset Management



Our global real estate organization provides asset
management services for single-client and commingled private and public real estate portfolios and manufactures and manages a variety of real estate investment vehicles investing in private and public real estate, primarily for institutional clients
through 22 offices worldwide. Our domestic and international real estate investment vehicles range from fully diversified open-end funds to specialized closed-end funds that invest in specific types of properties or specific geographic regions or
follow other specific investment strategies. Our global real estate organization has an established presence in the U.S., Europe, Asia and Latin America.



Strategic Investments



We make strategic investments to support the creation and management of funds offered to third-party investors in private and public real
estate, fixed income and public equities asset classes. The carrying value of these investments was approximately $1.1 billion at both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. For more information on these investments, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations for Financial Services Businesses by Segment—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Asset
Management.” Certain of these investments are made primarily for purposes of co-investment in our managed funds and structured products. Other strategic investments are made with the intention to sell or syndicate to investors, including our
general account, or for placement in funds and structured products that we offer and manage (seed investments). We also make loans to, and guarantee obligations of, our managed funds that are secured by equity commitments from investors or assets of
the funds.



Mutual Funds and Other Retail
Services



We manufacture, distribute and
service investment management products primarily utilizing proprietary asset management expertise in the U.S. retail market. Our products are designed to be sold primarily by financial professionals including both Prudential Agents and third party
advisors. We offer a family of retail investment products consisting of 41 mutual funds as of December 31, 2011. These products cover a wide array of investment styles and objectives designed to attract and retain assets of individuals with
varying objectives and to accommodate investors’ changing financial needs.



Additionally, we offer banks and other financial services organizations a wealth management platform, which permits such banks and organizations to provide their retail clients with services including
asset allocation, investment manager research and access, clearing, trading services, and performance reporting.



Marketing and Distribution



We provide investment management services for our institutional customers through a proprietary sales force organized by asset management business. Each asset management business has an independent
marketing and client service team working with clients. Institutional asset management services are also offered through the Retirement segment of the U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management division.







Most of the retail customer assets under management are invested in our mutual funds and our
variable annuities and variable life insurance products. These assets are gathered by the U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance division, the International Insurance division, the Individual Annuities segment and third party networks.
Additionally, we work with third party product manufacturers and distributors to include our investment options in their products and platforms.



We also provide investment management services across a broad array of asset classes for our general account, as described under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Realized Investment Gains and Losses and General Account Investments—General Account Investments.”



U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance Division



The U.S. Individual Life and Group Insurance
division conducts its business through the Individual Life and Group Insurance segments.



Individual Life



Our Individual Life segment manufactures and distributes individual variable life, term life and universal life insurance products primarily to the U.S. mass middle, mass affluent and affluent markets. In
general, we consider households with investable assets or annual income in excess of $100,000 to be mass affluent and households with investable assets in excess of $250,000 to be affluent in the U.S. market. Our life products are distributed
through independent third party distributors and Prudential Agents.



Certain fixed expenses are allocated between the Individual Life segment and the Closed Block Business based upon allocation methodologies consistent with U.S. GAAP reporting. However, as policies in
force within the Closed Block Business continue to mature or terminate, the level of expenses to be allocated to the Closed Block Business will decrease, thereby increasing the expense allocations to the Individual Life segment.



Competition



The Individual Life segment competes with large,
well-established life insurance companies in a mature market. We compete primarily based on price, service, distribution channel relationships, brand recognition and financial strength. Due to the large number of competitors, price competition is
strong. Factors that could influence our ability to competitively price products while achieving targeted returns include: the cost and availability of financing for statutory reserves required for certain term and universal life insurance policies,
the availability and timing of and our ability to utilize tax deductions associated with statutory reserves, product designs which impact the amount of statutory reserves and the associated tax deductions, and the level of and pace of changes in
interest rates. The current environment of low interest rates and volatile equity markets has resulted in a greater demand for dividend-paying whole life products across the industry which we no longer offer.



Products



Our primary insurance products are variable life, term life
and universal life and represent 41%, 49% and 9%, respectively, of our face amount of individual life insurance in force, net of reinsurance at the end of 2011. In recent years, as term life insurance sales have increased and variable life insurance
sales have decreased, term life insurance has become a larger percentage of our net in force.



Across all of our products, we offer a living benefits option that allows insureds who are diagnosed with a terminal illness, or permanently confined to a nursing home, to receive a portion of their
insurance benefit upon diagnosis, in advance of death, to use as needed.



We have a variety of settlement and payment options for the settlement of life insurance claims in addition to lump sum checks, including placing benefits in retained asset accounts, which earn interest
and are subject to withdrawal in whole or in part at any time by the beneficiaries.







Variable Life Insurance



We offer several individual variable life insurance products that provide a return linked to an underlying
investment portfolio selected by the policyholder while providing the policyholder with the flexibility to change both the death benefit and premium payments. The policyholder generally has the option of investing premiums in a fixed-rate option
that is part of our general account and/or investing in separate account investment options consisting of equity and fixed income funds. Funds invested in the fixed-rate option will accrue interest at rates we determine that vary periodically based
on our portfolio rate, subject to certain contractual minimums. In the separate accounts, the policyholder bears the fund performance risk. Each product provides for the deduction of charges and expenses from the customer’s contract fund. We
also offer a variable life product that has the same basic features as our variable universal life product but also allows for a more flexible guarantee against lapse where policyholders can select the guarantee period. In a portion of the affluent
market, we offer a private placement variable universal life product, which also utilizes investment options consisting of equity and fixed income funds. While variable life insurance continues to be an important product, marketplace demand
continues to favor term and universal life insurance.



A significant portion of our Individual Life insurance segment’s profits is associated with our large in force block of variable policies. Profit patterns on these policies are not level and as the
policies age, insureds generally begin paying reduced policy charges. This reduction in policy charges, coupled with net policy count and insurance in force runoff over time, reduces our expected future profits from this product line. Asset
management fees and mortality and expense fees are a key component of variable life product profitability and vary based on the average daily net asset value. Due to policyholder options under some of the variable life contracts, lapses driven by
unfavorable equity market performance may occur on a quarter lag with the market risk during this period being borne by the Company.



Term Life Insurance



We offer a variety of term life insurance products that provide coverage for a specified time period. Most term products include a
conversion feature that allows the policyholder to convert the policy into permanent life insurance coverage. We also offer term life insurance that provides for a return of premium if the insured is alive at the end of the level premium period.
There continues to be significant demand for term life insurance protection.



Individual Life’s profits from term insurance are not expected to directly correlate, from a timing perspective, with the increase in term insurance in force. This results from uneven product
profitability patterns, as well as varying costs of our ongoing capital management activities related to a portion of the statutory reserves associated with these products, which may vary with each year of business issued.



Universal Life Insurance



We offer universal life insurance products that feature
flexible premiums, a choice of guarantees against lapse, and a fixed crediting rate that we determine and that may vary periodically based on portfolio returns, subject to certain contractual minimums. Universal life policies provide for the
deduction of charges and expenses from the policyholders’ contract fund. Individual Life’s profits from universal life insurance are impacted by mortality and expense margins and net interest spread.



Marketing and Distribution



Third Party Distribution



Our individual life products are offered through a variety
of third party channels, including independent brokers, general agencies and producer groups. We focus on sales through independent intermediaries who provide life insurance solutions to protect individuals, families and businesses and support
estate and wealth transfer planning. The life insurance products offered are generally the same as those available through Prudential Agents. Our efforts in third party channels are supported by a network of internal and external wholesalers. We
also offer a simplified-issue term life insurance policy and a single-premium universal life insurance policy available to customers of select banks and other financial institutions.







Prudential Agents



Our Prudential Agents distribute Prudential variable, term and universal life insurance, variable and fixed
annuities, long-term care, and investment and other protection products with proprietary and non-proprietary investment options as well as selected insurance and investment products manufactured by others. The number of Prudential Agents was 2,529,
2,471 and 2,447 at December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Average agent productivity, based upon average commissions on new sales of all products by Prudential Agents, has increased to $53,708 for 2011 from $52,739 for 2010 primarily
due to higher annuity and mutual fund sales.



Prudential Agent product sales are primarily to customers in the U.S. mass and mass affluent markets, as well as small business owners.
Other than certain training allowances or salary paid at the beginning of their employment, we pay Prudential Agents on a commission basis for the products they sell. In addition to commissions, Prudential Agents receive employee benefits, including
medical and disability insurance, an employee savings program and qualified retirement plans.



Prior to the sale of our property and casualty insurance operations in 2003, the Individual Life segment had been compensated for property and casualty insurance products sold through Prudential Agents.
Following the sale, Prudential Agents have continued access to non-proprietary property and casualty products under distribution agreements entered into with the purchasers of these businesses, as well as other non-proprietary product providers;
therefore, the Individual Life segment continues to be compensated for sales of these products.



The compensation arrangements for certain non-proprietary property and casualty products provide an opportunity for additional compensation to the Individual Life segment based on multi-year profitability
of the products sold. This additional compensation is not predictable since the multi-year profitability of the products is subject to substantial variability and, additionally, the compensation arrangements are periodically renegotiated which will
affect the amount of additional compensation we are eligible to receive. The largest of these arrangements was revised effective in late 2008 and the profit opportunities were significantly reduced in 2010 and beyond. We do not expect the profit
opportunities from these arrangements to be significant in the future.



As mentioned above, the Individual Life segment distributes products offered by the Annuities, Group Insurance and Asset Management segments and is paid a market rate by these businesses to distribute
their products. These payments may be more or less than the associated distribution costs, and any profit or loss is included in the results of the Individual Life segment.



Underwriting and Pricing



For our fully underwritten life insurance, underwriters
follow detailed and uniform policies and procedures to assess and quantify the risk of our individual life insurance products. Depending on the age of the applicant and amount of insurance requested, we require the applicant to take a variety of
underwriting tests, such as medical examinations, electrocardiograms, blood tests, urine tests, and gather information such as physician records and investigative reports. We base premiums and policy charges for individual life insurance on expected
death benefits, surrender benefits, expenses and required reserves. We use assumptions for mortality, interest, expenses, policy persistency, and premium payment pattern in pricing policies. Some of our policies are fully guaranteed. Others have
current premiums/charges and interest credits that we can change subject to contractual guarantees.



Our operating results are impacted by changes in interest rates. We routinely update the interest crediting rates that we credit to policyholder accounts on our universal life policies and on the fixed
account of our variable life policies, which are both subject to contractual minimum rates. In resetting these rates, we consider the returns on our portfolios supporting these policies, current interest rates, the competitive environment and our
profit objectives. We seek to maintain a spread between the return on our general account invested assets and the interest we credit on our policyholder accounts. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, this spread may be negatively impacted
to the extent that our ability to reduce crediting rates applied to policyholder accounts is limited due to contractual minimum interest crediting rates. We seek to mitigate interest rate risks, including those associated with the current low
interest rate environment, with active asset/liability matching portfolio







management. For term life products, interest rate assumptions used to calculate reserves are fixed at the policy issue date and subsequent declines in portfolio yields have an immediate impact on
product profitability.



Our operating results are
also impacted by differences between actual separate account fund performance, mortality and persistency experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. Our Individual Life segment
employs capital management activities, including the financing of tax deductible statutory reserves required for certain term and universal life insurance policies, to maximize product returns and enable competitive pricing. Capital management
activities are impacted by insurance regulations and the cost of financing and our ability to access the capital markets. For a more detailed discussion of our capital management activities see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financing Activities.”



Reserves



We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations for in force life policies. We base these reserves on
assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality and morbidity rates, as well as margins for adverse deviation. For certain products, such as term and universal life, we are required to hold statutory
reserves in excess of these liabilities. In these circumstances, we engage in capital management activities, including the use of captive reinsurers, to reduce the financial and pricing impact of carrying a portion of these excess statutory
reserves. For variable and interest-sensitive life insurance contracts, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premium payments plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less
withdrawals, expenses and cost of insurance charges. Reserves also include claims reported but not yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported.



Reinsurance



The Individual Life segment uses reinsurance as a means of managing mortality volatility and risk capacity, which can impact product
profitability. Since 2000, we have reinsured a significant portion of the mortality risk we assume under our newly-sold individual life insurance policies. The maximum exposure we retain is $30 million on a single life and $35 million on a
second-to-die policy. In some instances, lower limits apply. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its obligations, we remain liable. On a Company wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the
concentration of counterparty risk to mitigate this exposure.



Group Insurance



Our Group Insurance segment manufactures and distributes a full range of group life, long-term and short-term group disability, long-term
care, and group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance in the U.S. primarily to institutional clients for use in connection with employee and membership benefits plans. Group Insurance also sells accidental death and dismemberment,
preferred provider and indemnity dental and other ancillary coverages, and provides plan administrative services in connection with its insurance coverages.



Competition



The Group Insurance segment competes with other large, well-established life and health insurance providers in the U.S. markets, and is a
top provider of both group life and disability insurance. The markets in which we compete are mature markets, hence we compete primarily based on price, strong brand recognition, service capabilities, customer relationships, financial stability and
range of product offerings. Due to the large number of competitors, price competition is strong. The majority of our premiums are derived from large corporations, affinity groups or other organizations, such as those with over 10,000 insured
individuals. We have a strong portfolio of products and the capability to offer customized benefit solutions to meet the complex needs of large clients, providing opportunities for continuing stabilized premiums and growth. Employee-pay (voluntary)
coverage has become increasingly important in today’s environment as employers attempt to control costs and shift benefit decisions/funding to employees who continue to value benefits offered at the workplace. Our ability to compete is largely
dependent on higher penetration in the voluntary coverage marketplace, which will be affected by future employment and compensation rates.







Products



Group Life Insurance



We offer group life insurance products including
employer-pay (basic) and employee-pay (voluntary) coverages. This portfolio of products includes basic and supplemental term life insurance for employees, optional term life insurance for dependents of employees and group universal life insurance.
We also offer group variable universal life insurance, basic and voluntary accidental death and dismemberment insurance and business travel accident insurance. Many of our employee-pay coverages include a portability feature, allowing employees to
retain their coverage when they change employers or retire. We also offer a living benefits option that allows insureds that are diagnosed with a terminal illness to receive a portion of their life insurance benefit upon diagnosis, in advance of
death, to use as needed.



We have a variety of
settlement and payment options for the settlement of life insurance claims in addition to lump sum checks, including placing benefits in retained asset accounts, which earn interest and are subject to withdrawal in whole or in part at any time by
the beneficiaries.



Group Disability Insurance



We offer short- and long-term group
disability insurance, which protects against loss of wages due to illness or injury. Short-term disability generally provides a weekly benefit amount (typically 50%-70% of the insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit) for three
to six months, and long-term disability covers the period after short-term disability ends. Long-term disability insureds may receive total or partial disability benefits. Most long-term disability policies begin providing benefits following a 90-
or 180-day waiting period (during which short-term disability may be provided) and generally continue providing benefits until the insured reaches normal retirement age. Long-term disability benefits are paid monthly and are limited to a portion,
generally 50%-70%, of the insured’s earned income up to a specified maximum benefit. Our approach to disability claims management incorporates a focus on early intervention, return-to-work programs and successful rehabilitation of claimants. We
also offer absence management services which assist employers in managing employee absences and workplace productivity including administrative tracking and management for certain employee absence events. The absence management services we provide
can also be integrated with our short- and long-term disability management services.



Other



We offer individual and group long-term care insurance, group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance and preferred provider organization (PPO) and indemnity dental plans. Long-term care
insurance protects the insured from the costs of an adult day care center, a nursing home or similar live-in care situation or a home health or a personal care aide. Group corporate-, bank- and trust-owned life insurance are group variable life
insurance contracts typically used by large corporations to fund deferred compensation plans and benefit plans for retired employees. PPO and indemnity dental products, as well as voluntary dental plans, are sold to groups with between 25 and 1,000
employees with no benefit waiting periods.



Marketing and
Distribution



Group Insurance has its own
dedicated sales force that is organized around products and market segments and distributes primarily through employee benefits brokers and consultants. Group Insurance also distributes individual long-term care products through Prudential Agents as
well as third party brokers and agents.



Underwriting and
Pricing



We have developed standard
rating systems for each product line in the Group Insurance segment based on our past experience and relevant industry experience. For our earlier generation long-term care products, experience data was very limited. As the long-term care industry
is maturing, the information available, both our own and industry experience, for use in underwriting has improved.



We are not obligated to accept any application for a policy or group of policies from any distributor. We follow industry standard
underwriting practices and procedures. If the coverage amount exceeds certain prescribed age and amount limits, we may require a prospective insured to submit evidence of insurability.







We determine premiums on some of our policies on a retrospective experience-rated basis, in
which case the policyholder bears some of the risk or receives some of the benefit associated with claim experience fluctuations during the policy period. We base product pricing of group insurance products on the expected pay-out of benefits that
we calculate using assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses and persistency, depending upon the specific product features.



Some policies are not eligible to receive experience-based refunds. The adequacy of our pricing of these policies determines their
profitability during the rate guarantee period. In addition, our profitability is subject to fluctuation period to period, based on the differences between actual mortality and morbidity experience and the assumptions used in pricing our policies.
However, we anticipate that over the rate guarantee period we will achieve mortality and morbidity levels more closely aligned with the assumptions used in pricing our policies. Market demand for multiple year rate guarantees for new policies
increases the risk associated with unanticipated changes in experience patterns as well as deviations from expense and interest rate assumptions. Changes in interest rates affect our operating results by impacting the spread income we earn between
our general account invested assets and the interest we attribute to policyholder liabilities. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, this spread may be negatively impacted to the extent our ability to reduce crediting rates applied to
policyholder liabilities has limitations, such as, minimum interest crediting rate commitments. We seek to mitigate interest rate risks, including those associated with the current low interest rate environment, with thorough underwriting, pricing
and active asset/liability matching portfolio management.



Reserves



We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future
obligations. We base these reserves on actuarially-recognized methods using morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the U.S., which we modify to reflect our actual experience when appropriate. Reserves also include claims reported but not
yet paid, and claims incurred but not yet reported. We also establish a liability for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative deposits plus credited interest and/or fund performance, less withdrawals, expenses and cost of
insurance charges, as applicable.



Reinsurance



The Group Insurance segment uses
reinsurance to limit losses from large exposures, and in response to client requests. To a smaller extent, we also assume risk through reinsurance in certain situations. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable to meet its obligations,
we remain liable. On a Company wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor concentration of counterparty risk to mitigate this exposure.



International Insurance Division



The International Insurance division conducts its business
through the International Insurance segment.



International
Insurance



Our International Insurance
segment manufactures and distributes individual life insurance, retirement and related products, including certain health products with fixed benefits. We provide these products to the broad middle income market across Japan through multiple
distribution channels including Life Advisors, who are associated with our Gibraltar Life operations. Our Gibraltar Life operations include our Gibraltar Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Gibraltar Life, which we acquired in April 2001, and the
businesses of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd. and AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, which we acquired in February 2011 and subsequently merged with Gibraltar Life on January 1, 2012. We also provide similar products to the mass affluent and
affluent markets in Japan, Korea and other countries outside the U.S. through our Life Planner operations. We commenced sales in non-U.S. markets through our Life Planner operations, as follows: Japan, 1988; Taiwan, 1990; Italy, 1990; Korea, 1991;
Brazil, 1998; Argentina, 1999; Poland, 2000; and Mexico, 2006.







For the year ended December 31, 2011, our Life Planner operation in Japan and our
Gibraltar Life operations represented 33% and 56%, respectively, of the net premiums, policy charges and fee income of the International Insurance segment, and in aggregate, represented 55% of the net premiums, policy charges and fee income of the
Financial Services Businesses, translated on the basis of weighted average monthly exchange rates. We continue to explore opportunities for a more diverse mix of business including an increased focus on the international retirement market.



We continue to seek opportunities for expansion
into high-growth markets in targeted countries, such as in China and India. During 2007, we entered into a joint venture in India where we have a 26% interest, the maximum currently allowed by regulation in India. The joint venture received its
insurance license in June 2008 and commenced sales of life insurance products shortly thereafter. In addition, we have an investment in China, through a consortium of investors that holds a minority interest in China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co.,
Ltd. In December 2009, China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co., Ltd. listed its shares on the Hong Kong exchange, and through December 2011, the consortium of investors sold approximately 65% of its holdings resulting in pre-tax benefits to Prudential
of $66 million in 2010 and $237 million in 2011. As of December 31, 2011, the carrying value of our remaining indirect investment in China Pacific Group was $126 million, including an unrealized gain of approximately $99 million, representing
changes in market value of China Pacific Group’s publicly traded shares, which is included in “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” There are no restrictions on the consortium of investors from selling its remaining
interest in China Pacific Group. For information regarding the Company’s new life insurance joint venture in China, see “—Corporate and Other—Corporate Operations.”



We manage each operation on a stand-alone basis with local management and sales teams, with oversight by senior
executives based in Asia, Latin America and Newark, New Jersey. Each operation has its own marketing, underwriting and claims, investment management, and actuarial functions. In addition, significant portions of the general account investment
portfolios are managed by certain of our international investment subsidiaries and, to a lesser extent, by our domestic asset management business. Operations generally invest in local currency securities, typically bonds issued by the local
government or its agencies. In our larger operations, we have more diversified portfolios that also include U.S. dollar-denominated investments in large part to support products issued in U.S. dollars and as part of our foreign exchange hedging
strategy. In addition, our Gibraltar Life operations have Australian dollar-denominated investments that support products issued in that currency.





Acquisition of AIG Star Life Insurance Co., Ltd., AIG Edison Life
Insurance Company and Related Entities



On February 1, 2011, Prudential Financial completed the acquisition from American International Group, Inc., or AIG, of AIG Star Life
Insurance Co., Ltd., or Star, AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, or Edison, and certain other AIG subsidiaries (collectively, the “Star and Edison Businesses”) pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated September 30, 2010 between
Prudential Financial and AIG. The total purchase price was $4,709 million, comprised of $4,213 million in cash and $496 million in assumed third party debt, substantially all of which is expected to be repaid, over time, with excess capital of the
acquired entities. All acquired entities are Japanese corporations and their businesses are in Japan.







The addition of these operations to our existing businesses increases our scale in the
Japanese insurance market and provides complementary distribution opportunities through an increased captive agency force and expanded bank channel distribution, as well as the addition of an established independent agency channel. Star and
Edison’s bank channel distribution is being transferred and integrated with the bank channel operations of Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Prudential Gibraltar. In addition, the Star and Edison companies were
merged into Gibraltar Life on January 1, 2012.



Acquisition of Yamato Life



On May 1, 2009, our Gibraltar Life operations acquired Yamato Life, a Japanese life insurance company that had declared bankruptcy in
October 2008. Gibraltar Life served as the reorganization sponsor for Yamato and, under the reorganization agreement, acquired Yamato by contributing $72 million of capital to Yamato. Concurrent with our acquisition, substantially all of
Yamato’s insurance liabilities were restructured under a plan of reorganization to include special surrender penalties on existing policies. These surrender charges were 20% in the first year and decline by 2% each year thereafter. Subsequent
to the acquisition, we renamed the acquired company The Prudential Gibraltar Financial Life Insurance Company, Ltd., or Prudential Gibraltar.



Competition



The life insurance markets in Japan and Korea are quite mature and highly penetrated. Private-sector life insurance companies also compete
with life insurance cooperatives and postal insurance entities in these markets. Generally, the cooperatives and postal insurance entities are not subject to the stringent insurance regulations that are effective for private-sector life insurers;
however, their product offerings are more limited. We generally compete based on service provided to the customers more than on price. Our Gibraltar Life operation focuses on quality service to a broader market segment. This is especially true in
the bancassurance market, where we provide quality in-house product expertise. In our operations other than Gibraltar Life and our joint venture in India, we compete by focusing primarily on a limited market using our Life Planner model to offer
high quality service and needs-based protection products. The success of our model in some markets makes us vulnerable to imitation and targeted recruitment of our sales force; thus the loss of highly-skilled and productive Life Planners to
competitors is a significant competitive risk. We direct substantial efforts to recruit and retain our Life Planners by continuously evaluating and adjusting our training and compensation programs, where appropriate, to positively impact
retention.



Products



With a diversified product mix supporting the growing demand
for retirement and savings products and continuing demand for protection life insurance products, our international insurance operations offer various traditional whole life, term life, endowment policies (which provide for payment on the earlier of
death or maturity) and retirement income life insurance products that combine an insurance protection element similar to that of term life policies with a retirement income feature. Certain of these products are offered with premiums and benefits
denominated in U.S. dollars. We also offer variable life products in Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Poland and interest-sensitive life products in all countries with the exception of Brazil and Mexico. In most of our operations, we also offer certain
health products with fixed benefits, some of which include a high savings element. In 2010, Gibraltar Life introduced a cancer whole life product which appeals to the business market because of its favorable tax treatment. Cancer whole life products
are offered through each of our Japanese entities.



Generally, our international insurance products are non-participating and denominated in local currency. Where non-local currency products
are offered, both the premiums and benefits are guaranteed in the currency of the product offered. Certain of our operations offer annuity products including variable annuities in Korea. Our fixed annuity products are primarily represented by U.S.
and Australian dollar-denominated fixed annuities in our Gibraltar Life operations. Our Gibraltar Life operations also offer euro and yen-denominated fixed annuity products. These contracts impose a market value adjustment if the invested amount is
not held to maturity. The market value adjustment can be positive, resulting in an additional amount for the contractholder, or negative, resulting in a deduction from the contractholder’s account value or redemption proceeds.







Marketing and Distribution



The following table sets forth the number of Life Planners and Life Advisors for the periods indicated.

Life Planner Model



Our Life Planner model is significantly
different from the way traditional industry participants offer life insurance in Japan and in most of the other countries where we do business. It also differs from the way we market through the Life Advisors and other distributional channels of
Gibraltar Life. We believe that our selection standards, training, supervision and compensation package are key to the Life Planner model and have helped our Life Planner operations achieve higher rates of agent retention, agent productivity and
policy persistency than our local competitors. In general, we recruit Life Planners with:



•university degrees, so that the Life Planner will have the same educational background and outlook as the target customer;



•a minimum of two years of sales or sales management experience;



•no prior life insurance sales experience; and



•a pattern of job stability and success.



The Life Planner’s primary objective is to sell protection-oriented life insurance products on a needs basis to mass affluent and
affluent customers, as well as to small businesses.



The number of Life Planners increased by 227 from 6,565 as of December 31, 2010 to 6,792 as of December 31, 2011, driven by an
increase of 84 in Brazil due to stronger recruitment, as well as increases of 62 in Korea, 32 in Poland, 31 in Italy and 15 in Japan.



Life Advisors



Our Life Advisors are the proprietary distribution force for products offered by Gibraltar Life. Their focus is to provide individual
protection products to the broad middle income market in Japan, particularly through relationships with affinity groups. Our Life Advisor operation is based on a variable compensation plan designed to improve productivity and persistency that is
similar to compensation plans in our Life Planner operations. The number of Life Advisors increased 6,510 in 2011 primarily reflecting the acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses.



Bank Distribution Channel



In 2006, Gibraltar Life commenced sales, primarily of U.S.
dollar-denominated fixed annuity products, through banks to supplement its core Life Advisor distribution channel. The fixed annuity product offering was expanded in 2009 to include Australian dollar, euro and yen-denominated products. In 2008,
Gibraltar Life began selling protection products, both yen and U.S. dollar-denominated, as a result of the liberalization of banking regulations allowing for the sale of additional insurance products. Sales of products primarily intended to provide
premature death protection comprised a major portion of bank channel sales for 2011 and 2010. During 2011, sales of protection products were highly concentrated in single pay or limited pay contracts which tend to be larger policies and therefore
have higher average premiums per policy. A significant amount of our sales in Japan through our bank channel distribution is derived through a single Japanese mega-bank. More recently, however,







certain of our other bank channel relationships are making an increasing contribution to the sales growth. During the latter half of 2011, we signed a distribution relationship with a second
Japanese mega-bank, expanding our distribution to now include two of Japan’s three largest banks. We continue to explore other opportunities to expand our distribution capabilities through the bank distribution channel.



Independent Agency Distribution Channel



The acquisition of the Star and Edison Businesses
transformed our participation in the Independent Agency Channel in Japan. Our focus will be to maintain a diverse mix of independent agency relationships including accounting firms, corporate agencies and independent agencies with a balanced focus
on individual and business markets. We plan to differentiate ourselves by providing quality service to producers in this distribution channel.



Underwriting and Pricing



Our International Insurance segment is subject to substantial local regulation that is generally more restrictive for product offerings,
pricing and structure than U.S. insurance regulation. Each International Insurance operation has its own underwriting department that employs variations of U.S. practices in underwriting individual policy risks. In setting underwriting limits, we
also consider local industry standards to prevent adverse selection and to stay abreast of industry trends. In addition, we set underwriting limits together with each operation’s reinsurers.



Pricing of our products, particularly individual life
insurance in Japan and Korea, is more regulated than in the U.S. Generally, premiums in each country are different for participating and non-participating products, but within each product type they are generally similar for all companies. Interest
rates guaranteed at issue under our insurance contracts may exceed the rates of return we earn on our investments, and, as a result, we may experience negative spreads between the rate we guarantee and the rate we currently earn on investments. The
profitability on our products from these operations results primarily from margins on mortality, morbidity and expense charges. In addition, the profitability of our products is impacted by differences between actual mortality and morbidity
experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies and, as a result, can fluctuate from period to period. However, we anticipate over the long-term to achieve the aggregate mortality and morbidity levels reflected in the assumptions used
in pricing.



Reserves



We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined
reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations. We base these reserves on assumptions we believe to be appropriate for investment yield, persistency, expenses, mortality and morbidity rates, as well as margins
for adverse deviation. For variable and interest-sensitive life products, as well as annuity products, we establish liabilities for policyholders’ account balances that represent cumulative gross premiums collected plus interest or investment
results credited less surrenders, and charges for cost of insurance and administration fees.



In some of the markets in which we operate, it is difficult to find appropriate long-duration assets to match the characteristics of our long-duration product liabilities. Due to the long-term nature of
many of the products we sell in Japan, we have historically sought to increase the duration of our Japanese yen investment portfolio by employing various strategies, including investing in longer-term securities or, by entering into long-duration
floating-to-fixed interest rate swaps. These strategies better support the characteristics of our long-dated product liabilities, and have resulted in higher portfolio yields. We continue to manage the interest rate risk profile of our businesses in
the context of market conditions and relative opportunities, and will implement these hedging strategies to lengthen the duration of our Japanese investment portfolio as our assessment of market conditions dictates. As we do so, the impact to our
portfolio yields will depend on the interest rate environment at that time.



Reinsurance



International Insurance reinsures portions of its insurance risks, primarily mortality, with both selected third party reinsurers and Prudential Insurance. International Insurance also buys catastrophe
reinsurance that covers multiple deaths from a single occurrence in our Japan, Taiwan and Brazil insurance operations. We also have







coinsurance agreements with Prudential Insurance for the U.S. dollar-denominated business in our Japanese Life Planner insurance operations. If a third party reinsurer is, for some reason, unable
to meet its obligations, we remain liable. On a Company-wide basis, we evaluate the financial condition of reinsurers and monitor the concentration of credit risk to mitigate this exposure.



Corporate and Other



Corporate and Other includes corporate operations, after
allocations to our business segments, and divested businesses except for those that qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.



Corporate Operations



Corporate operations consist primarily of:
(1) investment returns on capital that is not deployed in any business segments; (2) returns from investments not allocated to business segments, including debt-financed investment portfolios, and certain strategic joint venture
investments, as well as tax credit investments and other tax enhanced investments financed by business segments; (3) capital debt that is used or will be used to meet the capital requirements of the Company and the related interest expense;
(4) income and expense from qualified pension and other employee benefit plans, after allocations to business segments; (5) corporate-level income and expense, after allocations to business segments, including corporate governance,
corporate advertising, philanthropic activities, deferred compensation, and costs related to certain contingencies; (6) certain retained obligations relating to pre-demutualization policyholders whom we had previously agreed to provide
insurance for reduced or no premium in accordance with contractual settlements related to prior individual life insurance sales practices remediation; (7) results related to our Capital Protection Framework; and (8) the impact of
transactions with other segments.



Corporate
operations include results related to our Capital Protection Framework, which includes, among other things, the following:



•Our capital hedge program broadly addresses the equity market exposure of the statutory capital of the Company as a whole, under stress scenarios, as
described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries.”



•We manage certain risks associated with our variable annuity products through our living benefit hedging program, which is described under
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—U.S. Retirement Solutions and Investment Management Division—Individual Annuities.” We evaluate hedge levels versus our target given
overall capital considerations of the Company and prevailing market conditions and may decide to temporarily hedge to an amount that differs from our hedge target definition. Because this decision is based on the overall capital considerations of
the Company as a whole, the corresponding impact on results is reported within corporate operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Liquidity and Capital Resources of Subsidiaries—Domestic Insurance Subsidiaries” for additional discussion.



We assess the composition of these hedging programs on an ongoing basis, and we may change them from time to time based on our evaluation
of the Company’s risk position or other factors.



During 2011, we received approval from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to apply for a license to operate a life insurance joint venture in China. The joint venture is expected to commence
operations in the latter half of 2012, subject to regulatory approval. We will have a 50% interest in the joint venture company, the maximum currently allowed by regulation in China. The results of this strategic joint venture investment will be
reflected in corporate operations.







Divested Businesses



The following operations are businesses that have been or
will be sold or exited that did not qualify for “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. We include the results of these divested businesses in our income from continuing operations, but we exclude these results from
our adjusted operating income. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations—Segment Measures” for an explanation of adjusted operating income.



Residential Real Estate Brokerage Franchise and Relocation
Services



On
December 6, 2011, we sold our real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services businesses, which was comprised of Prudential Real Estate and Relocation Services, Inc. (“PRERS”) and its subsidiaries, to Brookfield Asset
Management, Inc. (“Brookfield”). We retained ownership of a financing subsidiary of PRERS with debt and equity investments in a limited number of real estate brokerage franchises. Under licensing agreements entered into in connection with
the sale, the real estate brokerage franchise and relocation services business may continue to use our servicemarks, including Prudential®, during a transition period, and the real estate brokerage franchisees may continue to use our servicemarks, including Prudential®, based on the terms of their respective franchise agreements. Also, we agreed to provide certain Brookfield
affiliates with transitional financing for the transferred relocation services that consists of a six month receivables purchase facility of up to $250 million, a six month credit facility of up to $25 million and a three year credit facility of up
to $155 million.



The real estate brokerage group
marketed franchises primarily to existing real estate companies with the franchise agreements granting the franchisee the right to use the Prudential name and real estate service marks in return for royalty payments on gross commissions generated by
the franchisees. The franchises generally were independently owned and operated.



The relocation group offered institutional clients and government agencies a variety of services in connection with the relocation of their employees. These services included: coordination of appraisal;
inspection, purchase and sale of relocating employees’ homes; equity advances to relocating employees; assistance in locating homes at the relocating employee’s destination; household goods moving services; client cost-tracking and a
variety of relocation policy and group move consulting services. Generally the client was responsible for carrying costs and any loss on sale with respect to a relocating employee’s home that was purchased by us. Government clients and certain
corporate clients utilized a fixed price program under which we assumed the benefits and burdens of ownership, including carrying costs and any loss on sale.



Financial Advisory



In 2008, we classified our Financial Advisory business as a divested business, reflecting our intention to exit this business. This
business consists of our former investment in the Wachovia Securities joint venture described below, which was sold on December 31, 2009, in addition to expenses relating to obligations and costs we retained in connection with the businesses we
contributed to the joint venture, primarily for litigation and regulatory matters.



On July 1, 2003, we combined our retail securities brokerage and clearing operations with those of Wachovia Corporation (“Wachovia”) and formed Wachovia Securities Financial Holdings, LLC
(“Wachovia Securities”). On December 31, 2008, Wachovia merged with and into Wells Fargo & Company (“Wells Fargo”), which succeeded to Wachovia’s rights and obligations under the joint venture agreements. On
December 31, 2009, we completed the sale of our minority joint venture interest in Wachovia Securities, which includes Wells Fargo Advisors, to Wells Fargo.



Commercial Mortgage Securitization Operations



In 2008, we classified our commercial mortgage
securitization operations as a divested business, reflecting our decision to exit this business. These operations, which involved the origination and purchase of commercial mortgage loans that we in turn would aggregate and sell into commercial
mortgage-backed securitization







transactions, together with related hedging activities, were previously reported within the Asset Management segment. We retained and continue the remainder of our commercial mortgage
origination, servicing and other commercial mortgage related activities, which remain a part of our Asset Management segment.



Property and Casualty Insurance



In 2003, we sold our property and casualty insurance companies, which included Prudential Property and Casualty Insurance Company
(“Prupac”) that operated nationally in 48 states outside of New Jersey, and the District of Columbia, to Liberty Mutual Group, or Liberty Mutual. We have agreed not to compete with the buyers. A non-compete agreement is effective until the
termination of our distribution agreement with Liberty Mutual. We have reinsured Liberty Mutual for adverse loss development for specific property and casualty risks that Liberty Mutual did not want to retain. We believe that we have adequately
reserved for our remaining property and casualty obligations under these reinsurance contracts based on the current information available.



In connection with the sale, Liberty Mutual has the right to sell Prupac back to us. This right became exercisable by Liberty Mutual as of
October 31, 2010. Under the terms of the put right, the business transferring to us would be the business we already reinsure, as described in the preceding paragraph. Any business written after the 2003 sale and prior to a put closing would
also transfer to us but would be fully reinsured by Liberty Mutual.



Prudential Securities Capital Markets



In 2000, we announced a restructuring of Prudential Securities’ activities to implement a fundamental shift in its business strategy.
We subsequently exited the lead-managed equity underwriting business for corporate issuers and the institutional fixed income business. As of December 31, 2011 we had remaining assets amounting to $37 million related to Prudential
Securities’ institutional fixed income activities.



Individual Health and Disability Insurance



We ceased writing individual disability income policies in 1992, and a year later ceased writing hospital expense and major medical
policies. Most of our individual disability income policies are non-cancelable; however, we reinsured all of these policies as of July 1999. For our hospital expense and major medical policies, the 1997 Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act guarantees renewal. Under certain circumstances, with appropriate approvals from state regulatory authorities, we are permitted to change the premiums charged for these policies if we can demonstrate the premiums have not been
sufficient to pay claims. We establish and carry as liabilities actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits that we believe will meet our future obligations.



Other



We have not actively engaged in the assumed life reinsurance market in the United States since the early 1990s;
however, we remain subject to mortality risk for certain assumed individual life insurance policies under the terms of the reinsurance treaties. In addition, we previously marketed individual life insurance in Canada through Prudential of America
Life Insurance Company, or PALIC. In 2000, we sold our interest in PALIC and remain subject to mortality risk for certain assumed individual life insurance policies sold by PALIC under the terms of the reinsurance treaties. We establish and carry as
liabilities actuarially-determined reserves for future policy benefits consistent with our methodologies for yearly renewable term life policies, which are less than the net amount at risk. As of December 31, 2011, the net amount at risk was
$68 million.



In addition to the above, we
indemnified the purchaser of PALIC for certain liabilities with respect to claims related to sales practices or market conduct issues arising from operations prior to the sale.



We also exited the equity sales, trading and research
operations of the Prudential Equity Group in 2007, and retained certain securities relating to trading exchange memberships of these former operations. These securities were received in 2006 in connection with the commencement of public trading of
stock exchange shares, and were fully disposed of in 2008.







Discontinued Operations



Discontinued operations reflect the results of the following businesses which qualified for “discontinued
operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP:



•We sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our group managed and indemnity healthcare business to Aetna Inc. in 1999.



•We discontinued certain branches of our international securities operations in the fourth quarter of 2002. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we
discontinued the remaining branches of our international securities operations.



•We discontinued the equity sales, trading and research operations of the Prudential Equity Group in the second quarter of 2007.



•We discontinued our Mexican asset management operations in the second quarter of 2009 and subsequently sold these operations in the fourth quarter of
2009.



•We discontinued our Korean asset management operations in the first quarter of 2010 and subsequently sold these operations in the second quarter of
2010.



•We discontinued our global commodities operations in the second quarter of 2011 and subsequently sold these operations in the third quarter of 2011.



In addition, direct real estate
investments that are sold or held for sale may require “discontinued operations” accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP.



Closed Block Business





Our strategy for the Closed Block Business is to maintain the Closed Block as required by our Plan of
Reorganization over the time period of its gradual diminishment as policyholder benefits are paid in full. We are permitted under the Plan of Reorganization, with the prior consent of the New Jersey Commissioner of Banking and Insurance, to enter
into agreements to transfer to a third party all or any part of the risks under the Closed Block policies. The long-term risks associated with the policies in the Closed Block are 90% reinsured, including 7% by a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Prudential Financial. In 2011, we also reinsured 90% of the short-term risks associated with the Closed Block policies to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Prudential Financial. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for more information on the Closed Block reinsurance arrangements. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion on the accounting of these
reinsurance arrangements.







As discussed in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, if the performance of the
Closed Block is more or less favorable than we originally assumed in funding, total dividends paid to Closed Block policyholders in the future may be greater or less than the total dividends that would have been paid to these policyholders if the
policyholder dividend scales in effect in 2000 had been continued. Any cash flows in excess of amounts assumed will be available for distribution over time to Closed Block policyholders as part of policyholder dividends, and it will not be available
to shareholders. A policyholder dividend obligation liability is established for these excess cash flows. Each year, the Board of Directors of Prudential Insurance determines the dividends payable on participating policies for the following year
based on the experience of the Closed Block, including investment income, net realized and unrealized investment gains, mortality experience and other factors. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for revenues, income and loss, and
total assets of the Closed Block Business.



Intangible and Intellectual Property



We capture and protect the innovation in our financial services products by applying for federal business method
patents and implementing trade secret controls, as appropriate. We also use numerous federal, state, common law and foreign servicemarks. We believe that the goodwill associated with many of our patents and trade secrets, and the goodwill associated
with many of our servicemarks, particularly “Prudential®,” “Prudential Financial®,” the Prudential logo and our “Rock” symbol, are significant competitive assets in the U.S.



On April 20, 2004, we entered into a
servicemark and trademark agreement with Prudential plc of the United Kingdom, with whom we have no affiliation, concerning the parties’ respective rights worldwide to use the names “Prudential” and “Pru.” The agreement is
intended to avoid customer confusion in areas where both companies compete. Under the agreement, there are restrictions on our use of the “Prudential” name and mark in a number of countries outside the Americas, including Europe and most
parts of Asia. Where these limitations apply, we combine our “Rock” symbol with alternative word marks. We believe that these limitations do not materially affect our ability to operate or expand internationally.



Competition



In each of our businesses, we face intense competition from
U.S. and international insurance companies, asset managers and diversified financial institutions. Many of our competitors are large and well-established and some have greater market share or breadth of distribution, offer a broader range of
products, services or features, assume a greater level of risk, have lower profitability expectations or have higher financial strength or credit ratings than we do. We compete in our businesses based on a number of factors including brand
recognition, reputation, quality of service, quality of investment advice, investment performance of our products, product features, scope of distribution and distribution arrangements, price, risk management capabilities, capital management
capabilities, perceived financial strength, and financial strength and credit ratings. The relative importance of these factors varies across our products, services and the markets we serve.









conditions may result in us being classified differently than competitors for purposes of capital and other requirements, potentially affecting our ability to compete and the competitive
landscape generally. The competitive landscape may also be impacted by longer term fiscal policies in response to adverse market and economic conditions including tax law changes, and the impacts of such policies on interest rates and economic and
market conditions generally and on financial and insurance products.



Consolidations among companies in the financial services industry may occur and result in competitors with increased market shares, or the introduction of larger or financially stronger competitors
through acquisitions or otherwise, in lines of business in which we compete.



Certain of our products compete on the basis of investment performance. A material decline in the investment performance of these products could have an adverse effect on our sales, as well as potentially
increase the level of withdrawals and customer complaints. Rankings and ratings of investment performance have a significant effect on our ability to increase our assets under management.



Competition for personnel in our businesses is intense, including for executive officers and management
personnel, Prudential Agents, Life Planners, Life Advisors and other sales personnel, and our investment managers. In the ordinary course of business, we lose personnel from time to time in whom we have invested significant training. We direct
substantial efforts to recruit and retain our insurance agents and employees and to increase their productivity. Competition for desirable non-affiliated distribution channels is also intense.



Many of our businesses are in industries where access to multiple sales channels may be a competitive
advantage. We currently sell insurance and investment products through both affiliated and non-affiliated distribution channels, including: (1) our captive sales channel; (2) independent agents, brokers and financial planners;
(3) broker-dealers that generally are members of the New York Stock Exchange, including “wirehouse” and regional broker-dealer firms; (4) broker-dealers affiliated with banks or that specialize in marketing to customers of banks;
(5) intermediaries such as retirement plan administrators; and (6) a rapidly growing bank channel in Japan. While we believe that certain insurance and investment products will continue to be sold primarily through face-to-face sales
channels, customers’ desire for objective and not product-related advice may, over time, increase the amount of insurance and investment products sold through non-affiliated distributors. In addition, we expect that certain insurance and
investment products will increasingly be sold through direct marketing, including through electronic commerce.



Although we distribute our products through a wide variety of distribution channels, we do maintain relationships with certain key
distributors. For example, historically, a significant amount of our sales in Japan through banks have been derived through a single Japanese mega-bank and a significant portion of our sales in Japan through Life Advisors is derived through a single
association relationship. We recently signed a distribution agreement with a second Japanese mega-bank, expanding our distribution to now include two of Japan’s three largest banks. We will continue to explore other opportunities to expand our
distribution capabilities through the bank channel, as well as other complementary distribution channels. We periodically negotiate the terms of these relationships, and there can be no assurance that such terms will remain acceptable to us or such
third parties.



The proliferation and growth of
non-affiliated distribution channels puts pressure on our captive sales channels to remain competitive with respect to product offerings, compensation, services offered, and recruiting and retention. We continue our efforts to strengthen and broaden
our sales channels, but we cannot assure that we will be successful. We run the risk that our competitors will have more distribution channels, stronger relationships with non-affiliated distribution channels, or will make a more significant or
rapid shift to direct distribution alternatives than we anticipate or are able to achieve ourselves. If this happens, our market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.



Regulation



Overview



Our businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. The purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our
customers and the overall financial system and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of







the laws and regulations to which we are subject are regularly re-examined, and existing or future laws and regulations may become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations.
The recent financial market dislocations produced, and are expected to continue to produce, extensive changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, applicable to our businesses in the U.S. and internationally, including the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act discussed below. As a result of terrorist activity in the U.S. and abroad, U.S. law and regulation of our international businesses, particularly as it relates to monitoring customer
activities, remains a significant factor in our operations.



Regulation Affecting Prudential Financial



Prudential Financial is the holding company for all of our operations. Prudential Financial itself is not licensed as an insurer,
investment advisor, broker-dealer, bank or other regulated entity. However, because it owns regulated entities, Prudential Financial is subject to regulation as an insurance holding company. Prudential Financial currently is also subject to
regulation as a savings and loan holding company. However, we intend to limit the operations of Prudential Bank & Trust, FSB to trust services prior to the effectiveness of the “Volcker Rule” provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act in
July 2012, permitting us to continue our institutional asset management business without the restrictions described below that might otherwise apply under the Volcker Rule. Such limitation will allow us to deregister as a savings and loan
holding company. As a company with publicly-traded securities, Prudential Financial is subject to legal and regulatory requirements applicable generally to public companies, including the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“SEC”) and the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) relating to public reporting and disclosure, securities trading, accounting and financial reporting, and corporate governance matters. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
rules and regulations adopted in furtherance of that Act have substantially increased the requirements in these and other areas for public companies such as Prudential Financial.



Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act



On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), which effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and subjects us to substantial additional federal regulation.
Dodd-Frank directs existing and newly-created government agencies and bodies to conduct certain studies and promulgate regulations implementing the law, a process that is underway and expected to continue over the next few years. We cannot predict
with any certainty the results of the studies or the requirements of the regulations not yet adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will affect the financial markets generally, impact our business, credit or financial strength ratings,
results of operations, cash flows or financial condition or make it advisable or require us to hold or raise additional capital.



Key aspects we have identified to date of Dodd-Frank’s potential impact on us include:





•













•Until deregistration as a savings and loan holding company is effective, Prudential Financial is subject in that capacity to the examination,
enforcement and supervisory authority of the FRB. Pursuant to the “Collins Amendment” included in Dodd-Frank, the FRB must establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for savings and loan holding companies (including
Prudential Financial) and other institutions that are not less than those applicable to insured depository institutions. These requirements would become generally applicable to Prudential Financial as a savings and loan holding company on
July 21, 2015 (five years after Dodd-Frank’s enactment) except, for purposes of calculating Tier 1 capital, new issuances of debt and equity capital will be immediately subject to the requirements. The risk-based capital requirements
currently applicable to most bank holding companies and insured depository institutions are based on the 1988 Capital Accord (“Basel I”) of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the “Basel Committee”); U.S. federal bank
regulatory agencies have also adopted new risk-based capital guidelines for large, internationally active banking organizations based on revisions to Basel I issued by the Basel Committee in 2004 (“Basel II”). In December 2010, the Basel
Committee released its final framework for strengthening international capital and liquidity regulation (“Basel III”). Basel III,











•The Council may recommend that state insurance regulators or other regulators apply new or heightened standards and safeguards for activities or
practices we and other insurers or other financial services companies engage in that could create or increase the risk that significant liquidity, credit or other problems spread among financial companies. We cannot predict whether any such
recommendations will be made or their effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.





•









require us to dispose of some covered fund investments, significantly alter our business practices in these operations and/or diminish the attractiveness of our covered fund products to clients.
Assuming we complete the conversion to a trust-only bank prior to July 21, 2012, but Prudential Financial is designated as a Designated Financial Company, the Volcker Rule prohibitions would not apply but we could be subject, pursuant to future
FRB rulemaking, to additional capital requirements for, and quantitative limits on, proprietary trading and sponsorship of, and investment in, covered funds. In addition, actions taken by other financial entities in response to the Volcker Rule
could potentially negatively affect the market for, returns from or liquidity of our investments in covered funds affiliated with such other financial entities.





•





•Dodd-Frank establishes a Federal Insurance Office within the Department of the Treasury headed by a director appointed by the Secretary of the
Treasury. While not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the director of this office performs various functions with respect to insurance (other than health insurance), including serving as a
non-voting member of the Council and making recommendations to the Council regarding insurers (potentially including the Company) to be designated for stricter regulation and coordinating with the FRB in the application of any stress tests required
to be conducted with respect to an insurer. The Federal Insurance Office is authorized to require an insurer or its affiliates to submit data and information that the office reasonably requires to carry out its functions. The director is also
required to conduct a study on how to modernize and improve the system of insurance regulation in the United States, including by increased national uniformity through either a federal charter or effective action by the states. Although the study
was to be completed in January 2012, it has not yet been released.



•Dodd-Frank authorizes the FRB to require a Designated Financial Company or a savings and loan holding company to place its financial activities in an
intermediate holding company separate from non-financial







activities (as defined for purposes of the Bank Holding Company Act) and imposes restrictions on transactions between the two businesses. While our non-financial activities are minor, the
imposition of such a requirement on us could be burdensome and costly to implement.



•Title II of Dodd-Frank provides that a financial company may be subject to a special orderly liquidation process outside the federal bankruptcy
code, administered by the FDIC as receiver, upon a determination (with the approval of the director of the Federal Insurance Office if – as is true with respect to Prudential Financial – the largest United States subsidiary is an insurer)
that the company is in default or in danger of default and presents a systemic risk to U.S. financial stability. Were Prudential Financial subject to such a proceeding, our U.S. insurance subsidiaries would remain subject to rehabilitation and
liquidation proceedings under state law, although the FDIC has discretion and authority to initiate resolution of an insurer under state law if its state insurance regulator has not filed the appropriate judicial action within 60 days of a
systemic risk determination. However, our non-insurance U.S. subsidiaries engaged in financial activities would be subject to any special orderly liquidation process so commenced. We cannot predict how creditors of Prudential Financial or its
insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, including the holders of Prudential Financial debt, will evaluate this potential or whether it will impact our financing or hedging costs.



•Dodd-Frank establishes the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (“CFPB”) as an independent agency within the FRB to regulate consumer
financial products and services offered primarily for personal, family or household purposes, with rule-making and enforcement authority over unfair, deceptive or abusive practices. Insurance products and services are not within the CFPB’s
general jurisdiction, and broker-dealers and investment advisers are not subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction when acting in their registered capacity. Retirement service providers such as us could become subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction,
but only if the Department of Labor and the Department of the Treasury agree. Otherwise, we believe we offer a very limited number of products subject to CFPB regulation and the impact of Dodd-Frank on our operations in this regard should not be
material; however, it is possible that the regulations promulgated by the CFPB will assert jurisdiction more expansively than we anticipate.



•Dodd-Frank includes various securities law reforms that may affect our business practices and the liabilities and/or exposures associated therewith,
including:



•In January 2011, the SEC staff issued a study that recommends that the SEC adopt a uniform federal fiduciary standard of conduct for registered
broker-dealers and investment advisers that provide retail investors personalized investment advice about securities, consider harmonization of the regulation applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers functions taking into account the
best elements of each regime and conduct rulemakings or provide guidance to facilitate the implementation of a federal fiduciary standard of care. The SEC staff study acknowledges that Dodd-Frank provides that the offering of proprietary products
would not be a per se violation of any new standard of care and that broker-dealers selling proprietary or a limited range of products could be permitted to make certain disclosures about their limited product offerings and obtain customer consents
or acknowledgements.



•In March 2011, the SEC and other regulators published for comment proposed regulations, as required by Dodd-Frank, requiring the securitizer, and
possibly the originator, of certain asset-backed securities to retain at least 5% of the credit risk of securities sold. Depending on how the final rule is implemented, these requirements may apply to certain activities of our retirement and
investment management segments if we are treated as a securitizer or an originator.



•Dodd-Frank imposes various assessments on financial companies, including: ex-post assessments to provide funds necessary to repay any borrowing and to
cover the costs of any special resolution of a financial company conducted under Title II (although the FDIC is to take into account assessments otherwise imposed under state insurance guaranty funds); if we were to become a Designated
Financial Company, assessments to fund a newly-created Office of Financial Research which, among other things, assists the Council; and assessments for the costs of our new regulation by the FRB. We are unable to estimate these costs at this time.



We cannot predict with any
certainty whether these possible outcomes will occur or the effect they may have on the financial markets or on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.







International Regulatory Initiatives



inter alia

i.e.



Further regulatory initiatives may develop in response to the
ongoing European sovereign debt crisis and other significant economic and political events (including any structural reforms or other changes made to the euro, the Eurozone or the European Union).



The foregoing requirements and developments could impact the
manner in which we deploy our capital, structure and manage our businesses, and otherwise operate both within and outside the U.S. The possibility of inconsistent and conflicting regulation of the Prudential Financial “group” of companies
also exists as law makers and regulators in multiple jurisdictions simultaneously pursue these initiatives.



Other U.S. Federal Regulation



U.S. Tax Legislation



There is uncertainty regarding U.S. taxes both for individuals and corporations in light of the fact that many tax provisions recently enacted or extended began to sunset at the end of 2011. In addition,
the recommendations made by the President’s bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform and other deficit reduction panels suggest the need to reform the U.S. Tax Code. Congress has held a number of hearings devoted to
tax reform. Some of those hearings have discussed lowering the tax rates and broadening the base by reducing







or eliminating certain tax expenditures. Reducing or eliminating certain tax expenditures could make our products less attractive to customers. It is unclear whether or when Congress may take up
overall tax reform and what would be the impact of reform on the Company and its products.





Additionally, legislative or regulatory changes could also impact the amount of taxes that we pay, thereby affecting our consolidated net
income. For example, the U.S. Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service intend to address through guidance the methodology to be followed in determining the dividends received deduction, or DRD, related to variable life insurance and
annuity contracts. The DRD reduces the amount of dividend income subject to U.S. tax and is a significant component of the difference between our actual tax expense and expected tax amount determined using the federal statutory tax rate of 35%. The
Revenue Proposals include a proposal to change the method used to determine the amount of the DRD. A similar proposal was included in the President’s deficit reduction recommendations that were released to Congress.



Furthermore, the Administration’s Revenue Proposals also
included items that would change the method by which U.S. multinationals claim foreign tax credits and the timing of the deduction for interest expense that is allocable to foreign source income.



Congress failed to extend a number of tax provisions that
expired at the end of 2011. One such provision provides tax deferral for investment income earned by a foreign insurance operation until the income is repatriated to the U.S. Although Congress may, as it has done in the past, extend retroactively
all expired provisions, the failure of Congress to do so will subject the Company to current U.S. tax on investment income earned by its foreign insurance subsidiaries.



For additional discussion of possible tax legislative and
regulatory risks that could affect our business, see “Risk Factors.”



Proposed Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee



The Obama Administration’s “General Explanations of the Administration’s Revenue Proposals” includes a proposal that would impose a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee, or FCRF, on
certain financial institutions with over $50 billion in consolidated assets, including the Company. The amount of the FCRF that would be imposed upon the Company under this proposal, in the event it is enacted into law, is unclear, but could be
substantial.



ERISA



ERISA is a comprehensive federal statute that applies to
U.S. employee benefit plans sponsored by private employers and labor unions. Plans subject to ERISA include pension and profit sharing plans and welfare plans, including health, life and disability plans. ERISA provisions include reporting and
disclosure rules, standards of conduct that apply to plan fiduciaries and prohibitions on transactions known as “prohibited transactions,” such as conflict-of-interest transactions and certain transactions between a benefit plan and a
party in interest. ERISA







also provides for a scheme of civil and criminal penalties and enforcement. Our insurance, asset management and retirement businesses provide services to employee benefit plans subject to ERISA,
including services where we may act as an ERISA fiduciary. In addition to ERISA regulation of businesses providing products and services to ERISA plans, we become subject to ERISA’s prohibited transaction rules for transactions with those
plans, which may affect our ability to enter transactions, or the terms on which transactions may be entered, with those plans, even in businesses unrelated to those giving rise to party in interest status.



USA Patriot Act



The USA Patriot Act of 2001, enacted in response to the
terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001, contains anti-money laundering and financial transparency laws applicable to broker-dealers and other financial services companies, including insurance companies. The Patriot Act seeks to promote
cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. Anti-money laundering laws outside of the U.S. contain provisions that may be different,
conflicting or more rigorous. The increased obligations of financial institutions to identify their customers, watch for and report suspicious transactions, respond to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies,
and share information with other financial institutions require the implementation and maintenance of internal practices, procedures and controls.



Holding Company Regulation



Prudential Financial is subject to the insurance holding company laws in the states where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled, which
currently include New Jersey, Arizona, Connecticut, Indiana and Iowa, or are treated as commercially domiciled, such as New York. These laws generally require each insurance company directly or indirectly owned by the holding company to register
with the insurance department in the insurance company’s state of domicile and to furnish annually financial and other information about the operations of companies within the holding company system. Generally, all transactions affecting the
insurers in the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and, if material, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the state’s insurance department.



Most states, including the states in which our U.S. insurance
companies are domiciled, have insurance laws that require regulatory approval of a direct or indirect change of control of an insurer or an insurer’s holding company. Laws such as these that apply to us prevent any person from acquiring control
of Prudential Financial or of our insurance subsidiaries unless that person has filed a statement with specified information with the insurance regulators and has obtained their prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, acquiring 10% or more
of the voting stock of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered a change of control, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person who acquires 10% or more of the voting securities of Prudential
Financial without the prior approval of the insurance regulators of the states in which our U.S. insurance companies are domiciled will be in violation of these states’ laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or
seizure of those securities by the relevant insurance regulator or prohibiting the voting of those securities and to other actions determined by the relevant insurance regulator.



Currently, there are several proposals to amend state
insurance holding company laws to increase the scope of regulation of insurance holding companies (such as Prudential Financial). The International Association of Insurance Supervisors, or the IAIS, and the National Association of Insurance
Commissioners, or the NAIC, have promulgated model laws for adoption internationally and in the United States that would provide for “group wide” supervision of Prudential Financial as an insurance holding company in addition to the
current regulation of Prudential Financial’s insurance subsidiaries. While the timing of their adoption and content will vary by jurisdiction, we have identified the following areas of focus in these model laws: (1) uniform standards for
insurer corporate governance; (2) group-wide supervision of insurance holding companies; (3) adjustments to risk-based capital calculations to account for group-wide risks; and (4) additional regulatory and disclosure requirements for
insurance holding companies. At this time, we cannot predict with any degree of certainty what additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on Prudential Financial.







In addition, many state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance
departments of a change in control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state. While these pre-notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the change in control, they authorize
regulatory action in the affected state if particular conditions exist such as undue market concentration. Any future transactions that would constitute a change in control of Prudential Financial may require prior notification in those states that
have adopted pre-acquisition notification laws.





Insurance Operations



State insurance laws regulate all aspects of
our U.S. insurance businesses, and state insurance departments in the fifty states, the District of Columbia and various U.S. territories and possessions monitor our insurance operations. Prudential Insurance is domiciled in New Jersey and its
principal insurance regulatory authority is the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. Our other U.S. insurance companies are principally regulated by the insurance departments of the states in which they are domiciled. Generally, our
insurance products must be approved by the insurance regulators in the state in which they are sold. Our insurance products are substantially affected by federal and state tax laws. Products in the U.S. that also constitute “securities,”
such as variable life insurance and variable annuities, are also subject to federal and some state securities laws and regulations. The Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and some
state securities commissions regulate and supervise these products.



State Insurance Regulation



State insurance authorities have broad administrative powers with respect to all aspects of the insurance business including:



•licensing to transact business;



•licensing agents;



•admittance of assets to statutory surplus;



•regulating premium rates for certain insurance products;



•approving policy forms;



•regulating unfair trade and claims practices;



•establishing reserve requirements and solvency standards;



•fixing maximum interest rates on life insurance policy loans and minimum accumulation or surrender values;







•regulating the type, amounts and valuations of investments permitted and other matters; and



•regulating reinsurance transactions, including the role of captive reinsurers.



State insurance laws and regulations require our U.S.
insurance companies to file financial statements with state insurance departments everywhere they do business, and the operations of our U.S. insurance companies and accounts are subject to examination by those departments at any time. Our U.S.
insurance companies prepare statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices and procedures prescribed or permitted by these departments. The NAIC has approved a series of statutory accounting principles that have been adopted,
in some cases with minor modifications, by all state insurance departments.



Beginning with the annual reporting period ending December 31, 2010, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Annual Financial Reporting Model Regulation, or the Model Audit Rule, related to auditor
independence, corporate governance and internal control over financial reporting. The adopted revisions require that we file reports with state insurance departments regarding our assessment of internal control over financial reporting.



State insurance departments conduct periodic examinations of
the books and records, financial reporting, policy filings and market conduct of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance
departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC.



Financial Regulation



Dividend Payment Limitations.The New Jersey insurance law and the insurance laws of the other states in which our insurance companies are domiciled regulate the amount
of dividends that may be paid by Prudential Insurance and our other U.S. insurance companies. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for
additional information.



Risk-Based
Capital.In order to enhance the regulation of insurers’ solvency, the NAIC adopted a model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for life, health and property and casualty insurance companies. All
states have adopted the NAIC’s model law or a substantially similar law. The risk-based capital, or RBC, calculation, which regulators use to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s statutory capital, measures the risk characteristics of a
company’s assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items. In general, RBC is calculated by applying factors to various asset, premium, claim, expense and reserve items. Within a given risk category, these factors are higher for those
items with greater underlying risk and lower for items with lower underlying risk. Insurers that have less statutory capital than the RBC calculation requires are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of regulatory
action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. The RBC ratios for each of our U.S. insurance companies currently are above the ranges that would require any regulatory or corrective action.



Insurance Reserves and Regulatory
Capital.State insurance laws require us to analyze the adequacy of our reserves annually. The respective appointed actuaries for each of our life insurance companies must each submit an opinion that our reserves,
when considered in light of the assets we hold with respect to those reserves, make adequate provision for our contractual obligations and related expenses.



Insurance regulators implemented changes in the way in which companies must determine statutory reserves for variable annuities and
products with similar guarantees as of the end of 2009. Insurance regulators continue to make progress in developing a principles based reserving approach for life insurance products. The timing and the effect of these changes are still uncertain.



Solvency Modernization
Initiative.State insurance regulators have focused attention on U.S. insurance solvency regulation pursuant to the NAIC’s “Solvency Modernization Initiative.” The Solvency Modernization Initiative
focuses on the entire U.S. financial regulatory system and all aspects of financial regulation affecting insurance companies. Though broad in scope, the NAIC has stated that the Solvency Modernization Initiative will focus on: (1) capital
requirements; (2) corporate governance and risk management; (3) group supervision; (4) statutory accounting and financial reporting; and (5) reinsurance.







IRIS Tests.The NAIC has developed a set of financial
relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, to assist state regulators in monitoring the financial condition of U.S. insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or action by
insurance regulatory authorities. Insurance companies generally submit data annually to the NAIC, which in turn analyzes the data using prescribed financial data ratios, each with defined “usual ranges.” Generally, regulators will begin to
investigate or monitor an insurance company if its ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. If an insurance company has insufficient capital, regulators may act to reduce the amount of insurance it can issue. None of our
U.S. insurance companies is currently subject to regulatory scrutiny based on these ratios.



Market Conduct Regulation



State insurance laws and regulations include numerous provisions governing the marketplace activities of insurers, including provisions governing the form and content of disclosure to consumers,
illustrations, advertising, sales practices and complaint handling. State regulatory authorities generally enforce these provisions through periodic market conduct examinations.



Insurance Guaranty Association Assessments



Each state has insurance guaranty association laws under
which insurers doing business in the state are members and may be assessed by state insurance guaranty associations for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Typically, states assess each member insurer
in an amount related to the member insurer’s proportionate share of the business written by all member insurers in the state. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $3.6 million, $0.8 million and $4.5
million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to state insurance guaranty association laws. Many states offer a reimbursement of such assessments in the form of credits against future years’ premium taxes. In addition, in 2011, we agreed to
make a voluntary contribution of $20 million to an insurance industry solvency fund, related to Executive Life Insurance Company of New York. In 2009, we received $9.3 million of refunds for assessments paid in prior years. While we cannot predict
the amount and timing of any future assessments on our U.S. insurance companies under these laws, we have established reserves that we believe are adequate for future assessments relating to insurance companies that are currently subject to
insolvency proceedings.



Federal and State Securities
Regulation Affecting Insurance Operations



Our variable life insurance products, as well as our variable annuity and mutual fund products, generally are “securities”
within the meaning of federal securities laws, that may be required to be registered under the federal securities laws and subject to regulation by the SEC and FINRA. Federal and some state securities regulation similar to that discussed below under
“—Investment Products and Asset Management Operations” and “—Securities Regulation” affect investment advice, sales and related activities with respect to these products.



Our mutual funds, and in certain states our variable life
insurance and variable annuity products, are “securities” within the meaning of state securities laws. As securities, these products are subject to filing and certain other requirements. Also, sales activities with respect to these
products generally are subject to state securities regulation. Such regulation may affect investment advice, sales and related activities for these products.



Investment and Retirement Products and Asset Management Operations



Our investment products and services are
subject to federal and state securities, fiduciary, including ERISA and other laws and regulations. The SEC, FINRA, CFTC, state securities commissions, state banking and insurance departments and the United States Department of Labor are the
principal U.S. regulators that regulate our asset management operations. For a discussion of Dodd-Frank’s impact on our investment products and asset management operations, see “— Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act” above.



Some of the separate account,
mutual fund and other pooled investment products offered by our businesses, in addition to being registered under the Securities Act, are registered as investment companies under the







Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the shares of certain of these entities are qualified for sale in some states and the District of Columbia. Separate account investment products
are also subject to state insurance regulation as described above. We also have several subsidiaries that are registered as broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and are subject to federal and
state regulation. In addition, we have several subsidiaries that are investment advisors registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our Prudential Agents and other employees, insofar as they sell products that are securities,
are subject to the Exchange Act and to examination requirements and regulation by the SEC, FINRA and state securities commissioners. Regulation and examination requirements also extend to various Prudential entities that employ or control those
individuals. The federal securities laws could also require re-approval by customers of our investment advisory contracts to manage mutual funds, including mutual funds included in annuity products, upon a change in control.



Congress from time to time considers pension reform
legislation that could decrease or increase the attractiveness of certain of our retirement products and services to retirement plan sponsors and administrators, or have an unfavorable or favorable effect on our ability to earn revenues from these
products and services. In this regard, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (“PPA”) made significant changes in employer pension funding obligations associated with defined benefit pension plans which are likely to increase sponsors’
costs of maintaining these plans. Over time, these changes could hinder our sales of defined benefit pension products and services and cause sponsors to discontinue existing plans for which we provide asset management, administrative, or other
services, but could increase the attractiveness of certain products we offer in connection with terminating or ongoing pension plans. The Worker, Retiree and Employer Recovery Act (the “Employer Recovery Act”) was passed in December 2008
in response to the financial crisis that began in the last half of 2007. The Employer Recovery Act modifies the method of calculating a plan’s assets for purposes of satisfying the minimum funding rules set forth in the PPA, and ameliorates the
financial impact of a plan not meeting its current funding target. As a result, the Employer Recovery Act may have the effect of delaying some of the positive and negative impacts of the PPA on our business.



For a discussion of potential federal tax legislation and
other federal regulation affecting our variable annuity products, see “—Insurance Operations—Federal Regulation” above.



Securities Regulation



We have subsidiaries that are broker-dealers, investment advisors or commodity trading advisors. The SEC, the CFTC, state securities
authorities, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and similar authorities are the principal regulators of these subsidiaries.



Our broker-dealer affiliates are members of, and are subject to regulation by, “self-regulatory organizations,” including FINRA.
Self-regulatory organizations such as FINRA conduct examinations of, and have adopted rules governing, their member broker-dealers. In addition, state securities and certain other regulators have regulatory and oversight authority over our
registered broker-dealers. Broker-dealers and their sales forces in the U.S. and in certain other jurisdictions are subject to regulations that cover many aspects of the securities business, including sales methods and trading practices. The
regulations cover the suitability of investments for individual customers, use and safekeeping of customers’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping, financial reporting and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. The
SEC and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., have the power to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease-and-desist
orders or suspension, termination or limitation of the activities of a broker-dealer or an investment advisor or its employees.



As registered broker-dealers and members of various self-regulatory organizations, our U.S. registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are
subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule. The Uniform Net Capital Rule sets the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain and also requires that at least a minimum part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in
relatively liquid form. These net capital requirements are designed to measure the financial soundness and liquidity of broker-dealers. Our broker-dealers are also subject to the net capital requirements of the CFTC and the various securities and
commodities exchanges of which they are members. Compliance with the net capital requirements could limit those operations that require the intensive use of capital, such as underwriting and trading activities, and may limit the ability of these
subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.







Privacy Regulation



Federal and state law and regulation require financial
institutions and other businesses to protect the security and confidentiality of personal information, including health-related and customer information, and to notify customers and other individuals about their policies and practices relating to
their collection and disclosure of health-related and customer information and their practices relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. State laws regulate use and disclosure of social security numbers. Federal
and state laws require notice to affected individuals, law enforcement, regulators and others if there is a breach of the security of certain personal information, including social security numbers, and require holders of certain personal
information to protect the security of the data. Federal regulations require financial institutions and creditors to implement effective programs to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft. Federal and state laws and regulations regulate the
ability of financial institutions to make telemarketing calls and to send unsolicited e-mail or fax messages to consumers and customers. Federal law and regulation regulate the permissible uses of certain personal information, including consumer
report information. Federal and state governments and regulatory bodies may be expected to consider additional or more detailed regulation regarding these subjects and the privacy and security of personal information.



Environmental Considerations



Federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations
apply to our ownership and operation of real property. Inherent in owning and operating real property are the risks of hidden environmental liabilities and the costs of any required clean-up. Under the laws of certain states, contamination of a
property may give rise to a lien on the property to secure recovery of the costs of clean-up, which could adversely affect our commercial mortgage lending business. In several states, this lien has priority over the lien of an existing mortgage
against such property. In addition, in some states and under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, or CERCLA, we may be liable, in certain circumstances, as an “owner” or
“operator,” for costs of cleaning-up releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances at a property mortgaged to us. We also risk environmental liability when we foreclose on a property mortgaged to us, although Federal legislation
provides for a safe harbor from CERCLA liability for secured lenders that foreclose and sell the mortgaged real estate, provided that certain requirements are met. However, there are circumstances in which actions taken could still expose us to
CERCLA liability. Application of various other federal and state environmental laws could also result in the imposition of liability on us for costs associated with environmental hazards.



We routinely conduct environmental assessments prior to taking title to real estate, whether through
acquisition for investment, or through foreclosure on real estate collateralizing mortgages that we hold. Although unexpected environmental liabilities can always arise, we seek to minimize this risk by undertaking these environmental assessments
and complying with our internal procedures, and as a result, we believe that any costs associated with compliance with environmental laws and regulations or any clean-up of properties would not have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations.



Unclaimed Property Laws



We are subject to the laws and regulations of states and
other jurisdictions concerning the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed or abandoned funds, and we are subject to audit and examination for compliance with these requirements. For additional discussion of these matters, see Note 23
to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Regulation of our
International Businesses



Our international
businesses are subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision. As in the U.S., the purpose of these regulations is primarily to protect our customers and not necessarily our shareholders. Many of the laws and regulations to which our
international businesses are subject are regularly re-examined, in some instances resulting in comprehensive restatements of applicable laws, regulations and reorganization of supervising authorities. Existing or future laws or regulations may
become more restrictive or otherwise adversely affect our operations as regulators seek to protect their financial systems from perceived systemic risk.







It is also becoming increasingly common for regulatory developments originating in the U.S., such as those discussed above, to be studied and adopted in some form in other jurisdictions in which
we do business and for regulatory proposals developed in other jurisdictions (including the European Union) or by international standard setting bodies to have cross-border impact on how our businesses are regulated. For example, the insurance
regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, including Japan and Korea, have introduced Sarbanes-Oxley type financial control requirements as well, and solvency regulatory approaches developed in Europe are being considered or adopted in
jurisdictions such as Japan and Mexico. It is likely that the recent financial market dislocations will lead to changes in existing laws and regulations, and regulatory frameworks, affecting our international business. Changes such as these can
increase compliance costs and potential regulatory exposure. In some instances, such jurisdictions may also impose different, conflicting or more rigorous laws and requirements, including regulations governing privacy, consumer protection, employee
protection, corporate governance and capital adequacy. In some jurisdictions, including Korea and Taiwan, new privacy protection laws have the potential to negatively impact certain aspects of our Life Planner business model, including our reliance
on customer referrals to generate new sales.



In
addition, our international operations face political, legal, operational and other risks that we do not face in the U.S., including the risk of discriminatory regulation, labor issues in connection with workers’ associations and trade unions,
nationalization or expropriation of assets, dividend limitations, price controls and currency exchange controls or other restrictions that prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which they operate or
converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. Some jurisdictions in which we operate joint ventures restrict our maximum percentage of ownership, which exposes us to joint venture partner risks and limits our array of
potential remedies.



Our international insurance
operations are principally supervised by regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate, including the Japanese Ministry of Finance and Financial Services Agency. We operate insurance companies in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Mexico,
Argentina, Brazil, Italy and Poland and have insurance operations in India through a joint venture in which we have a minority interest. We also received approval in 2011 from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission to apply for a license to
operate a life insurance joint venture in China. The insurance regulatory bodies for these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of insurance sales staff, insurance product approvals, sales practices, claims
payment practices, permissible investments, solvency and capital adequacy, and insurance reserves, among other items. In some jurisdictions, for certain products, regulators will also mandate premium rates (or components of pricing) or minimum
guaranteed interest rates. Periodic examinations of insurance company books and records, financial reporting requirements, market conduct examinations and policy filing requirements are among the techniques used by these regulators to supervise our
non-U.S. insurance businesses.



In order to
monitor insurers’ solvency, regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate outside the U.S. generally establish some form of minimum solvency margin requirements for insurance companies, similar in concept to the RBC ratios
that are employed by U.S. insurance regulators. These solvency margins are used by regulators to assess the sufficiency of an insurer’s capital and claims-paying ability and include the impact of transactions with affiliated entities. The
solvency margin ratios in certain jurisdictions are required to be disclosed to the public. Insurers that have less solvency margin than the regulators require are considered to have inadequate capital and are subject to varying degrees of
regulatory action depending upon the level of capital inadequacy. The solvency margin ratios for each of our international insurance operations currently are above the ranges that would require any regulatory or corrective action.



The Financial Services Agency, the insurance regulator in
Japan, has implemented revisions to the solvency margin requirements that will revise risk charges for certain assets and change the manner in which an insurance company’s core capital is calculated. Under the revised requirements, certain
financial assets will now be excluded from the core capital calculation and certain investment risk factors, including derivatives and foreign exchange, will be revised. These changes are effective for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2012;
however, we have already begun to publicly disclose both our old and new solvency margin calculations. We believe that the solvency margins of our Japanese insurance subsidiaries under the new method will continue to satisfy regulatory and other
requirements and will not negatively impact our competitive position. We anticipate further changes in solvency regulation from jurisdiction to jurisdiction based on regulatory developments in the U.S., the European Union, and recommendations by an
international standard setting body for the insurance industry, as well as







regulatory requirements for those companies deemed to be systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, in the U.S. or abroad. It is unclear what criteria will be used to determine
which companies will be deemed to be SIFIs or whether we will be so treated.



In addition, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), an international standard setting body, has been developing model regulatory standards that may result in the imposition of new
or more rigorous model regulatory requirements on our insurance operations in one or more countries related to risk management, corporate governance, group-wide supervision of insurance groups, as well as enhanced solvency, capital and liquidity
requirements.



The insurance regulatory bodies in
some of the countries where our international insurance businesses are located regulate the amount of dividends that they can pay to shareholders. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional information regarding the ability of our international subsidiaries to pay dividends to Prudential Financial.



Our international investment operations are also supervised
primarily by regulatory authorities in the countries in which they operate. We operate investment-related businesses in, among other jurisdictions, Japan, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, India, Germany and Singapore, and participate in
investment-related joint ventures in Brazil, Italy and China. These businesses may provide investment-related products such as investment management products and services, mutual funds, brokerage, and separately managed accounts. The regulatory
authorities for these businesses typically oversee such issues as company licensing, the licensing of investment product sales staff, sales practices, solvency and capital adequacy, mutual fund product approvals and related disclosures, securities,
commodities and related laws, among other items.



In some cases, our international investment operations are also subject to U.S. securities laws and regulations. Some of these operations
may be registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. Our international businesses may also be subject to other U.S. laws governing businesses controlled by U.S. companies such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act and certain regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Asset Controls. In addition, under current U.S. law and regulations we may be prohibited from dealing with certain individuals or entities in certain circumstances and we may be
required to monitor customer activities, which may affect our ability to attract and retain customers. Further, certain of our businesses, particularly those with operations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), are also subject to the
U.K.’s recently enacted Anti-Bribery Law, which governs interactions with both governmental and private commercial entities.



Certain of our international insurance operations, including those in Japan, may be subject to assessments, generally based on their
proportionate share of business written in the relevant jurisdiction, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. As we cannot predict the timing of future assessments, they may materially affect the
results of operations of our international insurance operations in particular quarterly or annual periods. In addition, in some jurisdictions, some of our insurance products are considered “securities” under local law. In those instances,
we may also be subject to local securities regulations and oversight by local securities regulators.



Under the Japanese insurance guaranty law, substantially similar to such laws in the U.S., all licensed life insurers in Japan are
required to be members and are assessed, on a pre-funded basis, by the Japan Policyholders Protection Corporation, or PPC. These assessments generate a collective fund which is used to satisfy certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to
policyholders and claimants. The PPC assesses each member in an amount related to its proportionate share of new business written by all member insurers. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we paid approximately $29 million,
$16 million and $15 million, respectively, in assessments pursuant to Japanese insurance guaranty association laws. As a result of our acquisition of Star and Edison in 2011, our overall share of the life insurance market in Japan, and therefore our
share of any future assessments under Japanese guaranty laws, will be proportionately higher than in the past.



Our international businesses are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the countries in which they are organized and in which they
operate. Foreign governments from time to time consider legislation that could impact the amount of taxes that we pay or impact the sales of our products.







In 2009, Taiwan enacted a corporate income tax rate decrease from 25% to 20% effective
January 1, 2010. Also in 2009, Mexico enacted a corporate income tax rate increase effective in 2010. In 2010, Taiwan further reduced the corporate tax rate from 20% to 17% for tax years beginning in or after 2010. On November 30, 2011,
Japan enacted the 2011 corporate tax reform that decreased the national corporate tax rate from 30% to 28.05%, after taking into account the special reconstruction corporate tax, for tax years beginning on or after April, 1, 2012, and to 25.5% for
tax years beginning on or after April 1, 2015. The carryforward period for net operating losses in Japan was increased from 7 to 9 years. Under the new legislation net operating losses can only offset 80% of a company’s taxable income. On
December 31, 2011 Korea rescinded the corporate tax decrease to 22% that was to be effective in 2012. Therefore, the Korean corporate tax rate remains at 24.2% for 2012 and thereafter.



Our international operations are often subject to value added tax and similar taxes in the countries in which
they operate. The Japan ruling party has proposed to increase the 5% consumption tax to 8% in April 2014 and to 10% in October 2015. An increase to such tax rates could reduce our consolidated net income.



While no official announcement has been made, there is
speculation that the Japan National Tax Authority (NTA) may reduce the corporate tax deductibility of premiums paid for cancer products. Such a change could result in a decrease in the sale of such products in Japan.



Our international operations are regulated in the
jurisdictions in which they are located or operate. These regulations may apply heightened scrutiny to non-domestic companies, which can reduce our flexibility as to intercompany transactions, investments and other aspects of business operations and
adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.



Employees



As of December 31, 2011, we had 50,104 employees and sales associates, including 31,219 located outside of the U.S. We believe our
relations with our employees and sales associates are satisfactory.
