Our Strengths

We believe the following competitive strengths contribute to our leading market position, differentiate us from our competitors and will drive future growth:

Industry Leading Brands

We have developed and operate brands that have come to represent an aspirational lifestyle. Our brands allow us to target markets across the economic spectrum, across demographics and across the world. We believe that our three flagship brands, Victoria's Secret, PINK and Bath & Body Works, are highly recognizable which provides us with a competitive advantage.

•At Victoria’s Secret, we market glamorous and sexy product lines to our customers. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in beauty products, fragrances, loungewear, athletic attire and personal care accessories.

•At PINK, we market products to the college-aged woman. While bras and panties are the core of what we do, this brand also gives our customers choices in apparel, loungewear, athletic attire and accessories.

•Bath & Body Works caters to our customers’ entire well-being, providing shower gels and lotions, aromatherapy, home fragrance, soaps and sanitizers and body care accessories.

In-Store Experience and Store Operations

We view our customers' in-store experience as an important vehicle for communicating the image of each brand. We utilize visual presentation of merchandise, in-store marketing, music and our sales associates to reinforce the image represented by the brands.

Our in-store marketing is designed to convey the principal elements and personality of each brand. The store design, furniture, fixtures and music are all carefully planned and coordinated to create a unique shopping experience. Every brand displays merchandise uniformly to ensure a consistent store experience, regardless of location. Store managers receive detailed plans designating fixture and merchandise placement to ensure coordinated execution of the company-wide merchandising strategy.

Our sales associates and managers are a central element in creating the atmosphere of the stores by providing a high level of customer service.

Digital Experience

In addition to our in-store experience, we strive to create a customer-centric digital platform that integrates the digital and physical brand experience.  Our digital presence, including social media, our websites and our mobile applications, allows us to get to know our customers better and communicate with them anytime and anywhere.

Product Development, Sourcing and Logistics

We believe a large part of our success comes from frequent and innovative product launches, which include bra launches at Victoria’s Secret, PINK and La Senza and new fragrance and product launches at Bath & Body Works. Our merchant, design and sourcing teams have a long history of bringing innovative products to our customers. Additionally, we believe that our sourcing and production function (Mast Global) has a long and deep presence in the key sourcing markets including those in the U.S. and Asia, which helps us partner with the best manufacturers to get high-quality products quickly.

Experienced and Committed Management Team

We were founded in 1963 and have been led since inception by Leslie H. Wexner. Our senior management team has a wealth of retail and business experience at L Brands, Inc. and other companies such as Nike, Coach, The Gap, The Home Depot, Land's End, Levi Strauss, Boots and Yum Brands. We believe that we have one of the most experienced management teams in retail.

Additional Information

Merchandise Vendors

During2017, we purchased merchandise from approximately350vendors located throughout the world. No vendor provided10%or more of our merchandise purchases.









Distribution and Merchandise Inventory

Most of our merchandise is shipped to our distribution centers in the Columbus, Ohio, area. We use a variety of shipping terms that result in the transfer of title of the merchandise at either the point of origin or point of destination.

Our policy is to maintain sufficient quantities of inventories on hand in our retail stores and distribution centers to enable us to offer customers an appropriate selection of current merchandise. We emphasize rapid turnover and take markdowns as required to keep merchandise fresh and current.

Information Systems

Our management information systems consist of a full range of retail, financial and merchandising systems. The systems include applications related to point-of-sale, e-commerce, merchandising, planning, sourcing, logistics, inventory management, data security and support systems including human resources and finance.

Seasonal Business

Our operations are seasonal in nature and consist of two principal selling seasons: Spring (the first and second quarters) and Fall (the third and fourth quarters). The fourth quarter, including the holiday season, accounted for approximately one-third of our net sales for2017,2016and2015and is typically our most profitable quarter. Accordingly, cash requirements are highest in the third quarter as our inventories build in advance of the holiday season.

Working Capital

We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs and investment opportunities.

Regulation

We and our products are subject to regulation by various federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities. We are subject to a variety of tax and customs regulations and international trade arrangements.

Our trademarks and patents, which constitute our primary intellectual property, have been registered or are the subject of pending applications in the United States Patent and Trademark Office and with the registries of many foreign countries and/or are protected by common law. We believe our products are identified by our intellectual property and, thus, our intellectual property is of significant value. Accordingly, we intend to maintain our intellectual property and related registrations and vigorously protect our intellectual property assets against infringement.

Segment Information

We have three reportable segments: Victoria’s Secret, Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works International.

Brand image, marketing, design, price, service, assortment and quality are the principal competitive factors in retail store sales. Our online businesses compete with numerous online merchandisers. Image presentation, fulfillment and the factors affecting retail store sales discussed above are the principal competitive factors in online sales.
