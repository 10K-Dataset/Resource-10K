History and Development

Tyco International Ltd.

Tyco International Ltd. is a Company organized under the laws of Switzerland. The Company was created as a result of the July 1997 acquisition of Tyco International Ltd., a Massachusetts corporation, by ADT Limited, a public company organized under the laws of Bermuda, at which time ADT Limited changed its name to Tyco International Ltd. Effective March 17, 2009, the Company became a Swiss corporation under articles 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (the "Change of Domicile").









Effective June 29, 2007, the Company completed the spin-offs of Covidien and TE Connectivity, formerly our Healthcare and Electronics businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies (the "2007 Separation") in the form of a tax-free distribution to Tyco shareholders.

Effective September 28, 2012, the Company completed the spin-offs of The ADT Corporation ("ADT") and Pentair Ltd. (formerly known as Tyco Flow Control International Ltd. ("Tyco Flow Control")), formerly our North American residential security and flow control businesses, respectively, into separate, publicly traded companies in the form of a distribution to Tyco shareholders. Immediately following the spin-off, Pentair, Inc. was merged with a subsidiary of Tyco Flow Control in a tax-free, all-stock merger (the "Merger"), with Pentair Ltd. ("Pentair") succeeding Pentair Inc. as an independent publicly traded company. The distributions, the Merger and related transactions are collectively referred to herein as the "2012 Separation". As a result of the distribution, the operations of Tyco's former flow control and North American residential security businesses are now classified as discontinued operations in all periods presented.

Tyco's registered and principal office is located at Victor von Bruns-Strasse 21, CH-8212 Neuhausen am Rheinfall, Switzerland. Its management office in the United States is located at 9 Roszel Road, Princeton, New Jersey 08540.



Segments

Each of our three segments serves a highly diverse customer base and none is dependent upon a single customer or group of customers. For fiscal year2013, no customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues, and approximately 50% of our revenues were derived from customers outside of North America.

Our end-use customers, to whom we may sell directly or through wholesalers, distributors, commercial builders or contractors, can generally be grouped in the following categories:

•Commercial customers, including residential and commercial property developers, financial institutions, food service businesses and commercial enterprises;

•Industrial customers, including companies in the oil and gas, power generation, mining, petrochemical and other industries;

•Retail customers, including international, regional and local consumer outlets;

•Institutional customers, including a broad range of healthcare facilities, academic institutions, museums and foundations;

•Governmental customers, including federal, state and local governments, defense installations, mass transportation networks, public utilities and other government-affiliated entities and applications; and

•Residential and small business customers outside of North America, including owners of single-family homes and local providers of a wide range of goods and services.

As discussed under "Competition" below, the markets in which we compete are generally highly fragmented. We therefore compete with many other businesses in markets throughout the world, including other large global businesses, significant regional businesses and many smaller local businesses.



Installation & Services

NA Installation & Services and ROW Installation & Services (collectively, "Installation & Services") designs, sells, installs, services and monitors electronic security and fire detection and suppression systems for retail, commercial, industrial, governmental and institutional customers around the world. Additionally, ROW Installation & Services designs, sells, installs, services and monitors security systems for residential and small business customers under the ADT brand name outside of North America.

Security Services

Our Installation & Services segments design, sell, install and service security systems to detect intrusion, control access and react to movement, fire, smoke, flooding, environmental conditions, industrial processes and other hazards. These electronic security systems include detection devices that are usually connected to a monitoring center that receives and records alarm signals where security monitoring specialists verify alarm conditions and initiate a range of response scenarios. For most systems, control panels identify the nature of the alarm and the areas where a sensor was triggered. Our other security solutions include access control systems for sensitive areas such as government facilities and banks; video surveillance systems designed to deter theft and fraud and help protect employees and customers; and asset protection and security management systems designed to monitor and protect physical assets as well as proprietary electronic data. Our offerings also include anti-theft systems utilizing acousto-magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry as well as store performance solutions to enhance retailer performance. Many of the world's leading retailers use ourSensormaticanti-theft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft. Many of the products that we install for our Installation &









Services security customers are designed and manufactured by our Global Products segment. Additionally, our deep experience in designing, integrating, deploying and maintaining large-scale security systems—including, for example, centrally managed security systems that span large commercial and institutional campuses—allows us to install and/or service products manufactured by third parties.

Purchasers of our intrusion systems typically contract for ongoing security system monitoring and maintenance at the time of initial equipment installation. These contracts are generally for a term of one to three years. Systems installed at customers' premises may be owned by us or by our customers. Monitoring center personnel may respond to alarms by relaying appropriate information to local fire or police departments, notifying the customer or taking other appropriate action. In certain markets, we directly provide the alarm response services with highly trained and professionally equipped employees. In some instances, alarm systems are connected directly to local fire or police departments.

In addition, our ROW Installation & Services segment is a leading provider of monitored residential and small business security systems. In addition to traditional burglar alarm and fire detection systems, installation and monitoring services, ROW Installation & Services provides patrol and response services in select geographies, including South Africa and South Korea. Our ROW Installation & Services segment continues to expand its offering of value-added residential services worldwide, such as an interactive services platform. The interactive services platform allows for remote management of the home security system, as well as lifestyle applications, which currently include remote video, lighting control, and energy management.

Our customers are often prompted to purchase security systems by their insurance carriers, which may offer lower insurance premium rates if a security system is installed or require that a system be installed as a condition of coverage.

Fire Protection Services

Customers

Our Installation & Services customers range from Fortune 500 companies with diverse worldwide operations who look to us to provide integrated, global solutions for their fire and security needs, to single location commercial customers and individual homeowners. Our Installation & Services customer relationships generally are in the market for new construction or retrofit projects, which represented 44% of Installation & Services fiscal2013net revenue, and the market for aftermarket products and services, which accounted for the remaining 56% of Installation & Services fiscal2013net revenue. New construction projects are inherently long-lead in nature and we strive to become involved in the planning process for these projects as early as possible. We believe that by actively participating in the preliminary design stages of a new construction project and by offering our design services that combine our global expertise and knowledge of local codes and standards, we can increase our value to customers relative to many smaller local and regional competitors. With respect to fire detection and suppression installations, we prefer to become involved at the time an architectural or engineering design firm is selected. With respect to security system design and installation, we generally become involved in the later stages of a construction project or as tenants take occupancy.

Our relationships with customers in the aftermarket may include any combination of alarm monitoring, fire and security maintenance and or testing and inspection services. We also provide aftermarket services to many customers whose fire and security systems were manufactured or installed by third parties.



Global Products

Our Global Products segment designs, manufactures and sells fire protection, security and life safety products, including intrusion security, anti-theft devices, breathing apparatus, and access control and video management systems.









Fire Protection Products

Fire Protection Products designs, manufactures, distributes and sells fire alarm and fire detection systems, automatic fire sprinkler systems and special hazard suppression systems, including many of the fire protection products that our Installation & Services segments install and service. Fire Protection Products also manufactures and sells grooved products for the rapid joining of piping in both the fire and non-fire markets. Fire Protection Products are marketed under various leading trade names, includingSimplex, Wormald, Ansul, Grinnell and Tycoand include fire alarm control panels, advanced fire alarm monitoring systems, smoke, heat and carbon monoxide detectors and voice evacuation systems. Fire Protection Products also offers a wide range of water-based sprinkler systems and custom designed special hazard suppression systems, which incorporate specialized extinguishing agents such as foams, dry chemicals and gases. These systems are often especially suited to fire suppression in industrial and commercial applications, including oil and gas, power generation, mining, petrochemical, manufacturing, transportation, data processing, telecommunications, commercial food preparation and marine applications.

Fire Protection Products' systems often are purchased by facility owners through construction engineers and electrical contractors, as well as mechanical or general contractors. In recent years, retrofitting of existing buildings has increased as a result of legislation mandating the installation of fire detection and fire suppression systems, especially in hotels, restaurants, healthcare facilities and educational establishments. The 2009 edition of the International Residential Code, developed by the International Code Council, a non-profit association that develops model codes that are the predominant building and fire safety regulations followed by state and local jurisdictions in the United States, adopted a proposal advanced by firefighters and other life-safety advocates that requires sprinkler systems in new one and two-family homes and townhouses as of January 2011. This national code is not binding on state and local jurisdictions and must be adopted locally before it becomes mandatory for new homes being built in these areas. The timing and extent of adoption, if at all, will vary by jurisdiction. However, we believe that this development may offer opportunities to expand our residential fire suppression business in the United States.

Security Products

Security Products designs and manufactures a wide array of electronic security products, including integrated video surveillance and access control systems to enable businesses to manage their security and enhance business performance. Our global access control solutions include integrated security management systems for enterprise applications, access control solutions applications, alarm management panels, door controllers, readers, keypads and cards. Our global video system solutions include digital video management systems, matrix switchers and controllers, digital multiplexers, programmable cameras, monitors and liquid crystal interactive displays. Our security products for homes and businesses range from basic burglar alarms to comprehensive interactive security systems including alarm control panels, keypads, sensors and central station receiving equipment used in security monitoring centers. Our offerings also include anti-theft systems utilizing acousto magnetic and radio frequency identification tags and labels in the retail industry. Our security products are marketed under various leading trade names, includingSoftware House, DSC, American Dynamics, Sensormatic, Visonic and Exacq. Many of the world's leading retailers use ourSensormaticanti-theft systems to help protect against shoplifting and employee theft. Security Products manufactures many of the security products that our Installation & Services business installs and services.

Life Safety Products

Life Safety Products manufactures life safety products, including self-contained breathing apparatus designed for firefighter, industrial and military use, supplied air respirators, air-purifying respirators, thermal imaging cameras, gas detection equipment, gas masks and personal protection equipment. The Life Safety Products business operates under various leading trade names, includingScott SafetyandProtector. Our breathing apparatus are used by the military forces of several countries and many U.S. firefighters rely on theScott Air-Pakbrand of self-contained breathing apparatus.

Customers

Global Products sells products through our Installation & Service segments and indirect distribution channels around the world. Some of Global Products' channel business partners act as dealers selling to smaller fire and security contractors that install fire detection and suppression, security and theft protection systems, whereas others act as integrators that install the products themselves. Builders, contractors and developers are customers for our sprinkler products. End customers for our breathing apparatus and related products include fire departments, municipal and state governments and military forces as well as major companies in the industrial sector.



Competition

The markets that we serve are generally highly competitive and fragmented with a small number of large, global firms and thousands of smaller regional and local companies. Competition is based on price, specialized product capacity, breadth of product line, training, support and delivery, with the relative importance of these factors varying depending on the project









complexity, product line, the local market and other factors. Rather than compete primarily on price, we emphasize the quality of our products and services, the reputation of our brands and our knowledge of customers' fire and security needs. Among large industrial, commercial, governmental and institutional customers, we believe that our comprehensive global coverage and product and service offerings provide a competitive advantage. We also believe that our systems integration capabilities, which allow us to offer global solutions to customers that fully integrate our security and/or fire offerings into existing information technology networks, business operations and management tools, and process automation and control systems, set us apart from all but a small number of other large, global competitors.

Competitive dynamics in the fire and security industry generally result in more direct competition and lower margins for installation projects compared to aftermarket products and services. We generally face the greatest competitive pricing pressure for the installation of products that have become more commoditized over time, including standard commercial sprinkler systems and closed-circuit television systems.



Backlog

See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for information relating to our backlog.



Intellectual Property

Patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including trademarks, patents and patent applications, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and misappropriation of our proprietary rights, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others.

We own a portfolio of patents that principally relates to: electronic security products and systems for intrusion detection, access control, electronic identification tags & video surveillance; fire protection products and systems, including fire detection and fire suppression with chemical, gas, foam and water agents; personal protective products and systems for fire and other hazards. We also own a portfolio of trademarks and are a licensee of various patents and trademarks. Patents for individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. Trademark rights may potentially extend for longer periods of time and are dependent upon national laws and use of the marks.

While we consider our patents to be valuable assets that help prevent or delay the commoditization of our products and thus extend their life cycles, we do not believe that our overall operations are dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. We share the ADT® trademark with ADT and operate under a brand governance agreement between the two companies.



Research and Development

We are engaged in research and development in an effort to introduce new products, to enhance the effectiveness, ease of use, safety and reliability of our existing products and to expand the applications for which the uses of our products are appropriate. For example, in order to position ourselves to participate in and lead the development of residential interactive platforms, enterprise-wide integrated access control platforms and transition IP video platforms, we have made significant investments in our security products portfolio. In addition, we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment. Our research and development expense was $174million in2013, $145 million in2012and $129 million in2011related to new product development.



Raw and Other Purchased Materials

We are a large buyer of metals and other commodities, including fuel for our vehicle fleet. We purchase materials from a large number of independent sources around the world and have experienced no shortages that have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. We enter into long-term supply contracts, using fixed or variable pricing to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions. Significant changes in certain raw material, including steel, brass and certain flurochemicals used in our fire suppression agents, may have an adverse impact on costs and operating margins.



Governmental Regulation and Supervision

Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the United States, in areas such as: consumer protection, government contracts, international trade, environmental protection, labor and employment, tax, licensing and others. For example, most U.S. states and non-U.S. jurisdictions in which we operate have licensing laws directed specifically toward the alarm and fire suppression industries. Our security businesses currently rely









extensively upon the use of wireline and wireless telephone service to communicate signals. Wireline and wireless telephone companies in the United States are regulated by the federal and state governments. In addition, government regulation of fire safety codes can impact our fire businesses. These and other laws and regulations impact the manner in which we conduct our business, and changes in legislation or government policies can affect our worldwide operations, both favorably and unfavorably. For a more detailed description of the various laws and regulations that affect our business, see Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Matters and Item 3. Legal Proceedings.



Environmental Matters

We are subject to numerous foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws governing, among other things, the generation, storage, use and transportation of hazardous materials; emissions or discharges of substances into the environment; and the health and safety of our employees.

Certain environmental laws assess liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at their properties or at properties at which they have disposed of hazardous substances. In addition to cleanup actions brought by governmental authorities, private parties could bring personal injury or other claims due to the presence of, or exposure to, hazardous substances or pursuant to indemnifications provided by us in connection with asset disposals. We have received notification from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and from state environmental agencies that conditions at a number of sites where we and others disposed of hazardous substances require cleanup and other possible remedial action and may require that we reimburse the government or otherwise pay for the cost of cleanup of those sites and/or for natural resource damages. We have projects underway at a number of current and former manufacturing facilities to investigate and remediate environmental contamination resulting from past operations by us or by other businesses that previously owned or used the properties.

Given uncertainties regarding the extent of the required cleanup, the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and alternative cleanup methods, the ultimate cost of cleanup at disposal sites and manufacturing facilities is difficult to predict. Based upon our experience, current information regarding known contingencies and applicable laws, we concluded that it is probable that we would incur remedial costs in the range of approximately$74 millionto$162 millionas ofSeptember 27, 2013. As ofSeptember 27, 2013, we concluded that the best estimate within this range is approximately$105 million, of which$82 millionis included in Accrued and other current liabilities and Accounts payable and$23 millionis included in Other liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. The majority of these liabilities relate to the ongoing remediation efforts at a facility in our Global Products segment located in Marinette, Wisconsin. In view of our financial position and reserves for environmental matters, we believe that any potential payment of such estimated amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For a more detailed description of these liabilities, see Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.



Employees

As ofSeptember 27, 2013, we employed approximately70,000people worldwide, of which approximately20,000were employed in the United States and approximately50,000were outside the United States. Approximately7,000employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils and we believe that our relations with the labor unions are generally good.
