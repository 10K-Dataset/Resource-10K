ITEM 1.BUSINESS



a)General
    Development of Business



ConAgra Foods, Inc. (“ConAgra Foods”,
    “Company”, “we”, “us”, or
    “our”) is one of North America’s leading food
    companies, with consumer brands in 97% of America’s
    households sold in grocery, convenience, mass merchandise and
    club stores. ConAgra Foods also has a strongbusiness-to-businesspresence, supplying frozen potato and sweet potato products, as
    well as other vegetable, spice, and grain products to a variety
    of well-known restaurants, foodservice operators, and commercial
    customers.



The Company began as a flour-milling company and entered other
    commodity-based businesses. Over time, through various
    acquisitions and divestitures, we significantly changed our
    portfolio of businesses, focusing on adding branded, value-added
    opportunities, while strategically divesting commodity-based
    businesses to become one of North America’s leading food
    companies. Executing this strategy involved the acquisition over
    time of a number of brands such asBanquet®,Chef
    Boyardee®,PAM®,Marie
    Callenders®,

    andAlexia®.

    More notable divestitures have included a dehydrated garlic,
    onion, capsicum and fresh vegetable operation, a trading and
    merchandising business, packaged meat and cheese operations, a
    poultry business, beef and pork businesses, and various other
    businesses. For more information about our more recent
    acquisitions and divestitures, see “Acquisitions” and
    “Divestitures” below. Our development over time has
    also been aided by innovation and organic growth. Recent
    successes include:Healthy
    Choice®Café
    Steamerstm,Healthy
    Choice®Fresh
    Mixerstm,Healthy
    Choice®All Natural Entrées,Marie
    Callender’s®Pasta Al Dente, and others.



We are focused on growing our core operations, expanding into
    adjacent categories, and increasing our presence in private
    label and international operations. Our core operations include
    the strategic product groups of convenient meals, potatoes,
    snacks, meal enhancers, and specialty items. We are also focused
    on sustainable sales and profit growth with strong and improving
    returns on invested capital. As part of continually
    strengthening our operating foundation, our major
    profit-enhancing initiatives have centered on and continue to
    include:



•Enhancing our portfolio by developing through innovation and
    acquiring of products that resonate with consumers;•Implementing high-impact, insights-based marketing programs;•Partnering strategically with customers to improve linkage,
    strengthen relationships, and capitalize on growth opportunities;•Improving trade spending effectiveness and pricing analytics;•Achieving cost savings throughout the supply chain with
    continuous efficiency improvement programs; and•Implementing efficiency initiatives throughout the selling,
    general, and administrative functions.



The Company’s growth, efficiency, and portfolio improvement
    initiatives continue to be implemented with high standards of
    customer service, product safety, and product quality.



We were initially incorporated as a Nebraska corporation in 1919
    and were reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in December
    1975.

General



The following comments pertain to both of our reporting segments.



ConAgra Foods is a food company that operates in many sectors of
    the food industry, with a significant focus on the sale of
    branded and value-added consumer products, as well as
    foodservice products and ingredients. We also manufacture and
    sell private label products. We use many different raw
    materials, the bulk of which are commodities. The prices paid
    for raw materials used in our products generally reflect factors
    such as weather, commodity market fluctuations, currency
    fluctuations, tariffs, and the effects of governmental
    agricultural programs. Although the prices of raw materials can
    be expected to fluctuate as a result of these factors, we
    believe such raw materials to be in adequate supply and
    generally available from numerous sources. We have faced
    increased costs for many of our significant raw materials,
    packaging, and energy inputs in the last twelve months. We seek
    to mitigate the higher input costs through productivity and
    pricing initiatives, and through the use of derivative
    instruments used to economically hedge a portion of forecasted
    future consumption.



We experience intense competition for sales of our principal
    products in our major markets. Our products compete with widely
    advertised, well-known, branded products, as well as private
    label and customized products. Some of our competitors are
    larger and have greater resources than we have. We compete
    primarily on the basis of quality, value, customer service,
    brand recognition, and brand loyalty.



Demand for certain of our products may be influenced by
    holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events.



We manufacture primarily for stock and fill customer orders from
    finished goods inventories. While at any given time there may be
    some backlog of orders, such backlog is not material in respect
    to annual net sales, and the changes of backlog orders from time
    to time are not significant.



Our trademarks are of material importance to our business and
    are protected by registration or other means in the United
    States and most other markets where the related products are
    sold. Some of our products are sold under brands that have been
    licensed from others. We also actively develop and maintain a
    portfolio of patents, although no single patent is considered
    material to the business as a whole. We have proprietary trade
    secrets, technology, know-how, processes, and other intellectual
    property rights that are not registered.



Many of our facilities and products are subject to various laws
    and regulations administered by the United States
    Department of Agriculture, the Federal Food and Drug
    Administration, the Occupational Safety and Health
    Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign
    governmental agencies relating to the quality and safety of
    products, sanitation, safety and health matters, and
    environmental control. We believe that we comply with such laws
    and regulations in all material respects, and that continued
    compliance with such regulations will not have a material effect
    upon capital expenditures, earnings, or our competitive position.



Our largest customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and its affiliates,
    accounted for approximately 18%, 18%, and 17% of consolidated
    net sales for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.





At May 29, 2011, ConAgra Foods and its subsidiaries had
    approximately 23,200 employees, primarily in the United
    States. Approximately 48% of our employees are parties to
    collective bargaining agreements. Of the employees subject to
    collective bargaining agreements, approximately 40% are parties
    to collective bargaining agreements that are scheduled to expire
    during fiscal 2012. We believe that our relationships with
    employees and their representative organizations are good.



Research
    and Development



We employ processes at our principal manufacturing locations
    that emphasize applied research and technical services directed
    at product improvement and quality control. In addition, we
    conduct research activities related to the development of new
    products. Research and development expense was $81 million,
    $78 million, and $78 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and
    2009, respectively.
