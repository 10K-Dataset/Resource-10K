Description of Business



We were incorporated in the state of Minnesota in 1966 as Sound of Music, Inc. Today, we are a leading provider of technology products, services and solutions. We offer expert service at unbeatable price more than 1.5 billion times a year to the consumers, small business owners and educators who visit our stores, engage with Geek Squad agents or use our websites or mobile applications. We have retail and online operations in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.



Information About Our Segments and Geographic Areas



We have two reportable segments: Domestic and International. The Domestic segment is comprised of the operations in all states, districts and territories of the U.S., operating e-commerce, retail store and call center operations under various brand names including, but not limited to, Best Buy (bestbuy.com), Best Buy Mobile, Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales. We operate Best Buy Mobile stores-within-a-store and offer Geek Squad services in all of our U.S. Best Buy stores. In addition, we operate Magnolia Home Theater, Magnolia Design Center and Pacific Kitchen and Home store-within-a-store experiences in select U.S. Best Buy stores, which we believe further enhance the range of product offerings and quality of expert customer service.



On February 1, 2014, we sold mindSHIFT Technologies, Inc. ("mindSHIFT"). We had previously acquired mindSHIFT, a managed service provider for small and mid-sized businesses, in fiscal 2012.



The International segment is comprised of: (i) all Canada operations, operating e-commerce and retail store operations under the brand names Best Buy (bestbuy.ca), Best Buy Mobile, Cell Shop, Future Shop (futureshop.ca) and Geek Squad; and (ii) all Mexico operations, operating under the brand names Best Buy (bestbuy.com.mx), Best Buy Express and Geek Squad. We operate Best Buy Mobile store-within-a-store concepts in all Best Buy branded stores in Canada.



In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Future Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canada under the Best Buy brand. This resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stores and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best Buy brand.



Additional information on these changes is included in Item 7,Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 13,Subsequent Events, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8,Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In fiscal 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest in Five Star. On December 3, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell Five Star, and we completed the sale on February 13, 2015. In fiscal 2009, we acquired a 50% controlling interest in Best Buy Europe Distributions Limited (“Best Buy Europe”), a venture with Carphone Warehouse Group plc (“CPW”).

Operations



Our Domestic and International segments are managed by leadership teams responsible for all areas of the business. Both segments operate a multi-channel platform that provides customers the ability to shop when and where they want, including online and in our retail stores.











Domestic Segment



Merchandise selection, pricing and promotions, procurement and supply chain, marketing and advertising, and labor deployment across all channels are centrally managed at our corporate headquarters. In addition, support capabilities (e.g., human resources, finance and real estate management) are generally performed at our corporate headquarters. We also have field operations that support retail teams. Our retail stores have procedures for inventory management, asset protection, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, product sales and services, staff training and merchandise display that are largely standardized within each store brand. All stores within each store brand generally operate under standard procedures with a degree of flexibility for store management to address certain local market characteristics.



International Segment



Our Canada store operations are similar to those in our Domestic segment, with centrally controlled advertising, merchandise purchasing and pricing, and inventory policies. In addition, corporate management performs support capabilities. Similar to our U.S. Best Buy stores, all Canada stores use a standardized operating system that includes procedures for inventory management, transaction processing, customer relations, store administration, staff training and merchandise display. The retail operations include two principal store brands. Future Shop stores have predominantly commissioned sales associates, whereas employees in Best Buy branded stores in Canada, like employees in U.S. Best Buy stores, are noncommissioned.



In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Future Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canada under the Best Buy brand. This resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stores and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best Buy brand.



Our stores in Mexico employ an operating model similar to that used in our U.S. Best Buy stores.



Merchandise and Services



Our Domestic and International segments have offerings in six revenue categories: Consumer Electronics, Computing and Mobile Phones, Entertainment, Appliances, Services and Other. Consumer Electronics consists primarily of television and home theater, digital cameras and camcorders, DVD and Blu-ray players; portable electronics such as MP3 devices, headphones and speakers, car stereo, navigation and satellite radio, and all related accessories. The Computing and Mobile Phones revenue category includes notebook and desktop computers, mobile phones and related subscription service commissions, tablets and all related accessories. The Entertainment revenue category includes video gaming hardware and software, DVDs, Blu-rays, CDs, digital downloads and computer software. The Appliances revenue category includes both large and small appliances and kitchen and bath fixtures. The Services revenue category consists primarily of extended warranty service contracts, technical support, product repair, delivery and installation. The Other revenue category includes non-core offerings such as snacks and beverages.



The merchandise and service offerings vary across our stand-alone store portfolio, with U.S. Best Buy Mobile, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales stores offering a more focused assortment.



Distribution



Domestic Segment



U.S. Best Buy online merchandise sales generally are either picked up at U.S. Best Buy stores or delivered directly to customers from a distribution center or retail store. The ship-from-store capability allows us to improve product availability and delivery times for customers. Most merchandise for our U.S. Best Buy, U.S. Best Buy Mobile, Magnolia Audio Video and Pacific Sales stores is shipped directly from manufacturers to our distribution centers or warehouses located throughout the U.S. In order to meet release dates for certain products, merchandise may be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers.



International Segment



Canada’s online merchandise sales are picked up at our stores, delivered directly to customers from a distribution center or retail store, or delivered directly to the customer from the vendor. Our Canada stores' merchandise is shipped directly from our suppliers to our Canadian distribution centers. In order to meet release dates for certain products, merchandise may also be shipped directly to our stores from suppliers.



Our stores in Mexico have distribution methods similar to that of our U.S. Best Buy stores.











Suppliers and Inventory



Our Domestic and International segments purchase merchandise from a variety of suppliers. In fiscal 2015, our 20 largest suppliers accounted for approximately 73% of the merchandise we purchased, with 5 suppliers – Apple, Samsung, Hewlett-Packard, Sony and LG Electronics – representing approximately 47% of total merchandise purchased. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our major suppliers that require them to continue supplying us with merchandise.



We carefully monitor and manage our inventory levels to match quantities on hand with consumer demand as closely as possible. Key elements to our inventory management process include the following: continuous monitoring of historical and projected consumer demand, continuous monitoring and adjustment of inventory receipt levels, agreements with vendors relating to reimbursement for the cost of markdowns or sales incentives and agreements with vendors relating to return privileges for certain products.



We also have a global sourcing operation to design, develop, test and contract-manufacture our own line of exclusive brand products.



Store Development



We had over 1,700 large and small-format stores at the end of fiscal 2015 throughout our Domestic and International segments. We believe this store footprint represents an advantage that we can leverage as we continue to transform our business. In the U.S., we have the ability to ship from all of our Best Buy stores, and we have opened a number of vendor store-within-a-store concepts to better leverage our square footage. In fiscal 2016 and beyond, we will continue to look for opportunities to optimize our store space, renegotiating leases and selectively opening or closing locations to support our ongoing transformation.



In March 2015, we made a decision to consolidate Future Shop and Best Buy stores and websites in Canada under the Best Buy brand. This resulted in permanently closing 66 Future Shop stores and converting 65 Future Shop stores to the Best Buy brand.



Refer to Item 7,Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,for tables reconciling our Domestic and International segment stores open at the end of each of the last three fiscal years.



Intellectual Property



We own or have the right to use valuable intellectual property such as trademarks, service marks and tradenames, including, but not limited to,Best Buy, Best Buy Mobile, Dynex, Future Shop, Geek Squad, Init, Insignia, Magnolia, Modal, My Best Buy, Pacific Sales, Rocketfish, and ourYellow Taglogo.



We have secured domestic and international trademark and service mark registrations for many of our brands. We have also secured patents for many of our inventions. We believe our intellectual property has significant value and is an important factor in the marketing of our company, our stores, our products and our websites.



Seasonality



Our business, like that of many retailers, is seasonal. A higher proportion of our revenue and earnings is generated in the fiscal fourth quarter, which includes the majority of the holiday shopping season in the U.S., Canada and Mexico.



Working Capital



We fund our business operations through a combination of available cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows generated from operations. In addition, our revolving credit facilities are available for additional working capital needs, for general corporate purposes and investment opportunities. Our working capital needs typically increase in the months leading up to the holiday shopping season as we purchase inventory in advance of expected sales.



Competition



Our competitors are primarily traditional store-based retailers, multi-channel retailers, internet-based businesses and vendors and mobile network carriers who offer their products directly to the consumer.











Some of our competitors have low cost operating structures and seek to compete for sales primarily on price. In addition, in the U.S., online-only operators are exempt from collecting sales taxes in certain states. We believe this advantage will continue to be eroded as sales tax rules are re-evaluated at both the state and federal levels. We carefully monitor pricing offered by other retailers, and maintaining price competitiveness is one of our ongoing priorities. In addition, we have a price-matching policy in the U.S. that allows customers to request that we match a price offered by certain retail store and online operators. In order to allow this, we are focused on maintaining efficient operations and leveraging the economies of scale available to us through our global vendor partnerships.



In addition to price, we believe our ability to deliver a high quality customer experience offers us a key competitive advantage. We believe our dedicated and knowledgeable people, integrated online and store channels, broad product assortment, range of focused service and support offerings, distinct store formats, brand marketing strategies and supply chain are important ways in which we maintain this advantage.



Environmental Matters



Best Buy is committed to creating a thriving business while lessening our environmental impact. In the U.S., consumers recycle more electronics through Best Buy than any other retailer. In fiscal 2015, we collected more than 126 million pounds of consumer electronics and 110 million pounds of appliances, helping us meet our goal of collecting one billion pounds (set in 2009). The recycling program remains an important offering in supporting our customers, communities and the environment.



We offer a large selection of energy-efficient products, which help our customers save money by using less energy. Best Buy’s U.S. customers purchased more than 25 million ENERGY STAR® certified products in fiscal 2015 and realized utility bill savings of more than $71 million. These energy savings equate to over 900 million pounds of CO2avoidance, or the equivalent of removing more than 86,000 cars from U.S. roads.



We are continuously working to make our locations more sustainable and to increase efficiency within our supply chain. In calendar 2010, we set a goal of reducing our absolute carbon emissions in North America by 20% by the year 2020 (over a 2009 baseline).To date, these energy efficiency measures reduced more than 200,000 metric tons of CO2emissions and helped us to exceed our goal of 20%.



We are not aware of any federal, state or local provisions that have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, that have materially affected, or are reasonably expected to materially affect, our net earnings or competitive position, or have resulted, or are reasonably expected to result in, material capital expenditures. See Item 1A,Risk Factors, for additional discussion.



Number of Employees



At the end of fiscal 2015, we employed approximately125,000full-time, part-time and seasonal employees in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and our sourcing office in China. We consider our employee relations to be good. We offer our employees a wide array of company-paid benefits that vary within our company due to customary local practices and statutory requirements, which we believe are competitive in the aggregate relative to others in our industry.
