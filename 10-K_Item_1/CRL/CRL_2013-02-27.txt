Overview

We are a leading global provider of solutions that accelerate the early-stage drug discovery and development process. The focus of our business isin vivobiology; our portfolio includes research models and services required to enablein vivodrug discovery and development.

Discoveryrepresents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences, directed at the identification, screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development. Discovery activities typically extend anywhere from 4-6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines.

Developmentactivities, which follow, and which can take up to 7-10 years, are directed at demonstrating thesafety, tolerabilityandclinical efficacyof the selected drug candidates. During the preclinical stage of the development process, a drug candidate is testedin vitro(typically on a cellular or sub-cellular level in a test tube or multi-well petri plate) andin vivo(in research models) to support planned or on-going human trials.

The development of new drugs requires the steadily increasing investment of time and money.  Various studies and reports estimate that it takes between 10-15 years, up to $2.0 billion, and exploration of more than 10,000 drug compounds to produce a single FDA-approved drug. We are positioned to leverage our core competency inin vivobiology in an efficient and cost-effective way to aid our clients in bringing their drugs to market faster. Our clients reduce their costs, increase their speed and improve their productivity and effectiveness in early-stage discovery and development by using our broad portfolio of products and services.

For over 65 years, we have been in the business of providing the research models required in research and development of new drugs, devices and therapies. Over this time, we have built upon our core competency ofin vivobiology to develop a diverse and expanding portfolio of products and services. Our client base includes global pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, government agencies, and leading hospitals and academic institutions around the world.We currently operate approximately 65 facilities in 15 countries worldwide. Our products and services, supported by our global infrastructure and deep scientific expertise, enable our clients to meet many of the challenges of early-stage life sciences research. In 2012, our net sales from continuing operations were $1.1 billion and our operating income from continuing operations was $166.5 million.

We have two reporting segments: Research Models and Services (RMS) and Preclinical Services (PCS).

Throughour RMS segment, we have been supplying research models to the drug development industry since 1947. With over 150 different strains, we continue to maintain our position as the global leader in the production and sale of the most widely used rodent research model strains, principally genetically and microbiologically defined purpose-bred rats and mice.Wealso provide a variety of related services that are designed to assist our clients in supporting the use of research models in drug discovery and development. With multiple facilities located on three continents (North America, Europe and Asia), we maintain production centers, including barrier rooms and/or isolator facilities, strategically located near our clients. In 2012, RMS accounted for 61.5% of our total net sales from continuing operations and approximately 50% of our employees including approximately 90 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees.

Our PCS business segment provides services that enable our clients to outsource their critical, regulatory-required safety assessment and related drug development activities to us. The demand for these services has historically been driven by preclinical development programs of biotechnology companies, which traditionally have been outsourced, and also by the selective outsourcing strategy of larger global pharmaceutical companies. Global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies choose to outsource their development activities because a significant investment in personnel, facilities and other capital resources is required to efficiently and effectively conduct these activities.  Outsourcing allows them to focus on their core competencies of innovation and early drug discovery and, particularly for pharmaceutical companies, promotion and market distribution.

We are one of the two largest providers of preclinical (including both discovery and development) services worldwide and offer particular expertise in the design, execution and reporting of safety assessment studies, especially those dealing with large molecule (biologics) and other innovative therapies. We currently provide preclinical services at multiple facilities located in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Our PCS segment represented 38.5% of our total net sales from continuing operations in 2012 and employed 45% of our employees including approximately 430 science professionals with advanced scientific degrees.










We provide discovery services in both our RMS and PCS business segments.  The biopharmaceutical industry continues to reduce infrastructure and search for more efficient and cost-effective models of drug discovery and development. In particular, large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are outsourcing biopharmaceutical discovery research, an area they historically considered a core competency.  These services, which are generally non-regulated, are used by sponsors to screen molecules and make earlier “go-no go” decisions as to which molecules should be selected for continued investment.

In recent years, we have focused our efforts on unifying our businesses and improving the efficiency of our global operations to enhance our ability to support our key clients. Our key pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients are increasingly seeking full service, “one-stop” global partners to whom they can outsource more of their drug discovery and development efforts.  By some estimates, the outsourced early-stagedrug discovery and development services markets in which we currently participate, ranging from research model production to discovery services to regulated safety assessment, is approximately $7.5 billion and in the aggregate is expected to increase over time as outsourcing trends continue.It is estimated that the market for regulated safety assessment services is approximately 40% outsourced, while emerging growth areas such asin vivodiscovery and certain research model services are currently believed to be less outsourced.

Research Models and Services (RMS).Our RMS segment is comprised of (1) Research Models, (2) Research Model Services and (3) Endotoxin and Microbial Detection.

Research Models.Our Research Models business is comprisedof the production and sale of research models and avian vaccine services.

A significant portion of this business is comprised of the commercial production and sale of research models, principally purpose-bred rats and mice for use by researchers. We provide our rodent models to numerous clients around the world, including most pharmaceutical companies, a broad range of biotechnology companies, many government agencies, and leading hospitals and academic institutions.We have 20 production facilities located in 7 countries worldwide, which are strategically located in close proximity to our clients. Our research models include both standard strains and disease models such as those with compromised immune systems, which are in demand as early-stage research tools. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and foreign regulatory bodies typically require that the safety and efficacy of new drug candidates be tested on research models like ours prior to testing in humans. As a result, our research models are an essential part of the drug discovery and development process.

Our rodent species have been, and continue to be, some of the most extensively used research models in the world, largely as a result of our continuous commitment to innovation and quality. Our research models are bred and maintained in controlled environments which are designed to ensure that the models are free of specific viral and bacterial agents and other contaminants that can disrupt research operations and distort results. With our barrier room production capabilities, we are able to deliver consistently high-quality research models worldwide.

Our small research models include:

•outbred, which are purposefully bred for heterogeneity;

•inbred, which are genetically identical; hybrid, which are the offspring of two different inbred parents;

•spontaneous mutant, which contain a naturally occurring genetic mutation (such as immune deficiency); and

•other genetically modified research models, including knock-out models with one or more disabled genes and transgenic models.

We also offer proprietary, disease-specific mouse and rat models used to find new treatments for diseases such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular and kidney disease. We are presently focusing our disease model program on five areas of research: oncology, central nervous system, metabolic, cardiovascular and renal diseases.

We are a premier provider of high quality, purpose bred, specific-pathogen-free (SPF) large research models to the biomedical research community.

We are the global leaderfor the supply of SPF fertile chicken eggs and chickens. SPF chicken embryos are used by animal health companies as self-contained “bioreactors” for the manufacture of live viruses. These viruses are used as a raw material primarily in poultry as well as human and veterinary vaccine applications. The production of SPF eggs is performed under biosecure conditions, similar in many ways to our research model production. We have a worldwide presence, with several SPF egg production facilities in the United States, contracted production capabilities in Hungary, and franchise










operations in India. We also operate a specialized avian laboratory in the United States, which provides in-house quality control testing of the SPF flocks, offers testing services to vaccine companies and commercial poultry operations, and manufactures poultry diagnostics and bulk antigens for poultry vaccines.

Research Model Services.RMS also offers a variety of services designed to support our clients' use of research models in screening drug candidates. These services capitalize on the technologies and relationships developed through our research model business, and address the need among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to outsource the non-core aspects of their drug discovery activities. These services include those which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of research models, and those which are designed to implement efficacy screening protocols to improve the client's drug evaluation process. We currently offer four major categories of research models services-Genetically Engineered Models and Services, Insourcing Solutions, Discovery Research Services and Research Animal Diagnostic Services.

Genetically Engineered Models and Services (GEMS).We breed and maintain research models purchased or purposefully created by our clients for biomedical research activities.  The creation of a genetically engineered model (GEM) is a critical scientific event, but it is only the first step in the discovery process. Productive utilization of GEMs requires significant additional technical expertise in order to properly support early discovery research.  Our team of project managers is supported by a technologically advanced internet based colony management system that allows for real time data exchange.  We also provide breeding expertise and colony development, quarantine, health and genetic monitoring, germplasm cryopreservation, and rederivation including assisted reproduction. We provide these services to clients around the world from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to hospitals and universities.

Insourcing Solutions (IS).We manage research operations (including recruitment, training, staffing and management services) for government entities, academic organizations and commercial clients. Research institutions prefer to outsource staffing and management while retaining certain elements of their research in-house thus driving demand for our services.  We believe that our expertise inin vivobiology, and in particular research model care, facility operations, and discovery and development services, enhances the productivity and quality of our clients' research model programs.

Discovery Research Services (DRS).

DRS represents the earliest stages of research in the life sciences, directed at the identification, screening and selection of a lead compound for future drug development. DRS activities typically extend anywhere from 4-6 years in conventional pharmaceutical research and development timelines.  We offer research and development expertise, capabilities, and services globally to accelerate our clients' drug discovery pipelines from lead generation to candidate selection.  We complement clients' capabilities and expertise to improve their decision-making, increase their flexibility, and reduce their internal costs and product development timelines. We support a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology, bone and muscoskeletal, inflammation, metabolic, cardiovascular ophthalmology and CNS diseases.  In addition, we provide non-therapeutic support in a non-regulated environment to support lead optimization to candidate selection activities.  Examples of this include, early pharmacokinetic and pharmocodynamic studies and

in vitro

and

in vivo

assays to assess mechanism, bioavailability, metabolism, and safety pharmacology.  As we look forward, we believe there are emerging opportunities to assist our clients in a variety of drug discovery applications and platforms from target validation to candidate selection.  Services performed at sites dedicated to discovery services are considered part of our research model services and part of our RMS segment.

Research Animal Diagnostic Services (RADS).We monitor and analyze the health profiles of the research models and cell lines of our clients. We developed this capability internally by building upon the scientific foundation created by the diagnostic needs of our research model business. We are able to serve as our clients' sole-source testing laboratory, or as an alternative source supporting our clients internal laboratory capabilities . We believe we are the reference laboratory of choice for health testing of laboratory research models and an industry leader in the field of animal diagnostics.  We can also offer non-GXP biomarker assay platforms and services to support early stage discovery studies.  Across these platforms, we can provide both standard as well as customized biomarker testing, including serum and urine chemistries.

Endotoxin and Microbial Detection(EMD)(f/k/aIn Vitro). Our EMD business provides non-animal, orin vitro,methods for lot release testing of medical devices and injectable drugs for endotoxin contamination. In addition, with our acquisition of Accugenix, we provide our clients with state-of-the-art microbial identification services for manufacturing in the biopharmaceutical, medical device, nutraceutical and consumer care industries.

Endotoxin testing uses a processed extract from the blood of the horseshoe crab, known as limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL). The LAL test is the first and most successful FDA-validated alternative to an animal model test to date. The extraction of blood does not harm the crabs, which are subsequently returned to their natural ocean environment. Our EMDbusiness produces and distributes endotoxin testing kits, reagents, software, accessories, instruments and associated services to










pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide. We are a market leader in endotoxin testing products and services, which are used for FDA-required quality control testing of injectable drugs and medical devices, their components and the processes by which they are manufactured.

The growth in our EMDbusiness is driven by our FDA approved line of next-generation endotoxin testing products, which are based on the Endosafe Portable Testing System (Endosafe®-PTS™) technology that allows rapid endotoxin testing in the central laboratory or manufacturing environment. In recent years, we expanded the PTS product portfolio to include a multiple sample testing system known as the Endosafe®-MCS™ (multi cartridge system) to satisfy the demand of our clients who have higher volumes of tests to perform. We anticipate our clients' demand for rapid methods of testing will increase as they respond to the FDA's Process Analytical Technology (PAT) Initiative. In November 2012, we introduced the first fully automated robotic system developed specifically for high-volume endotoxin testing, Endosafe®-Nexus™.  We expect to start shipping the Endosafe®-Nexus™ in 2013.  We expect to see expanded use of this rapid endotoxin testing technology in non-traditional areas such as renal dialysis, nuclear and compounding pharmacies, and cellular therapy. We are currently exploring obtaining 510(k) medical device approval of this technology for clinical diagnostic applications.

In 2012, our EMD business acquired Accugenix, the premier global provider of cGMP- compliant contract microbial identification testing.  Accugenix is an acknowledged industry leader in species-level identification and strain typing of bacteria and fungi that are recovered from manufacturing facilities.  Utilizing state-of-the-art and proprietaryin vitrotechnologies, coupled with scientific expertise and analysis, Accugenix excels in providing accurate, time-effective and cost-effective microbial identification services required to meet internal quality standards and government regulations.

Preclinical Services (PCS)

We currently offer preclinical services, both regulated and non-regulated, in which we include bothin vivoandin vitrostudies, supportive laboratory services, and strategic preclinical consulting and program management to support product development.  We also provide DRS activities at certain of our PCS sites, including non-GLP pharmacokinetics, metabolism and pharmacology support to assist in the process of integrative drug candidate selection which we reported in our PCS segment.

Safety Assessment.We offer a full range of preclinical studies required for regulatory submission on a global basis.

Bioanalysis, Pharmacokinetics, and Drug Metabolism.In support of preclinical drug safety testing, our clients are required to demonstrate ample drug exposure, stability in the collected sample, kinetics of their drug or compound in circulation, the presence of metabolites, and, with recombinant proteins and peptides, the presence or absence of anti-drug antibodies. We have scientific depth in the sophisticated bioanalytical techniques required to satisfy these requirements for a number of drug classes. After performing sample analysis for preclinical study support, we have the opportunity to capture the benefits of bridging the preclinical bioanalysis with subsequent clinical development. Once the analysis is complete, our scientists evaluate the data to provide information on the pharmacokinetics and/or toxicokinetics of the drug, and complete an evaluation of the distribution of the drug or metabolites. Pharmacokinetics refers to understanding what the body does to a drug or compound once administered, including the process by which the drug is absorbed, distributed in the body, metabolized, and excreted (ADME); toxicokinetics refers to the same understanding as applied at higher doses that may result in adverse effects. These studies are required for the full preclinical assessment of the disposition of the drug and the results are used in the final preclinical safety evaluation of the compound.

Toxicology.Toxicology is one of our core preclinical competencies and a competitive strength. Once a lead molecule is selected, toxicology studies are conducted in support of clinical trials in humans. These toxicology studies focus on safety and assess any harmful effects.  They are typically performed in research models to elucidate any potential adverse effects that a compound has on an organism over a variety of doses and over various time periods. Our toxicology services feature:



•all the standard protocols for general toxicity testing (genotoxicity, safety pharmacology, acute, sub-acute, chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity bioassays) required for regulatory submissions supporting “first-in-human” to “first-to-the-market” strategies;

•expertise in specialty routes of administration and modes of administration (e.g., infusion, intravitreal, intrathecal, and inhalation), which are important not only for the testing of potential pharmaceuticals, but also for the safety testing of medical devices, industrial chemicals, food additives, agrochemicals, biocides, nutraceuticals, animal health products and other materials;

•expertise in the conduct and assessment of reproductive and developmental toxicology studies (in support of larger scale and later-stage human clinical trials);










•services in important specialty areas such as ocular, bone, juvenile/neonatal, immuno-toxicity, photobiology and dermal testing;

•work in all major therapeutic areas;

•study design and strategic advice to our clients based on our wealth of experience and scientific expertise in support of drug development; and

•a strong history of assisting our clients in achieving their regulatory or internal milestones for safety testing, including studies addressing stem cell therapies, DNA vaccines, protein biotherapeutics, small molecules and medical devices.

Our preclinical facilities comply with Good Laboratory Practices (GLPs) to the extent required by the FDA as well as other international regulatory bodies. Our facilities are regularly inspected by U.S. and other regulatory compliance monitoring authorities, our clients' quality assurance departments and our own internal quality assessment program.

Pathology Services.The ability to identify and characterize clinical and anatomic pathologic changes is critical in determining the safety of potential new therapeutics. We employ a large number of highly trained veterinary pathologists and other scientists who use state-of-the-art techniques to identify potential test article-related changes within tissues, fluids and cells, as well as at the molecular level. Pathology support is critical not only for regulatory safety assessment studies, but also for specialized investigative studies, discovery support, and stand-alone immunohistochemistry evaluations for monoclonal antibodies. Key “go/no-go” decisions regarding continued product development are typically dependent on the identification, characterization and evaluation of gross and microscopic pathology findings we perform for our clients.

Biopharmaceutical Services.We perform specialized testing of biologics and devices frequently outsourced by global pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. Our laboratories in the United States, Germany, Scotland and Ireland provide timely and compliant molecular biology, virology, bioanalytical, immunochemistry, microbiology and related services. We confirm that biological processes and the drug candidates produced are consistent, correctly defined, stable and essentially contaminant free. This testing is required by the FDA and other global regulatory authorities for our clients to obtain new drug approvals, to maintain government licensed manufacturing facilities and to release approved therapeutic products for patient treatment.

Our manufacturing services group grows and stores well-characterized early-stage client cell lines for later development or manufacture of therapeutic proteins and vaccines for clinical trials. We further design and provide viral clearance projects for Phase I, II and III studies in our German and US facilities.



Our Strategy

Our objective is to be the preferred strategic global partner for our clients.  We drive our growth by providing our clients superior, flexible and tailored solutions to help them accelerate and enhance the efficiency of their drug research and development efforts. Our strategy is to deliver a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of early-stage/drug discovery and development products, services, and solutions to support our clients' goal to maintain the flexible infrastructure that they require to bring new and improved therapies to market faster and more cost effectively. We believe we have certain competitive advantages in executing this strategy, as a result of our continuing focus on the following:



Integrated Early-Stage Portfolio.We are the only large, global contract research organization (CRO) with a portfolio of products, services, and solutions that focuses almost exclusively on early-stage drug discovery and preclinical development.  We provide research models and associated services, discovery research studies and services, and comprehensive safety assessment and toxicology studies in both regulated and non-regulated environments.  As such, we are able to collaborate with clients from early lead generation through candidate selection. When critical decisions are made regarding which therapies will progress or remain in development, we continue to work alongside them as the drug candidates move downstream through the preclinical development process and post-candidate selection. Our recognized expertise in in vivo biology and pharmacology provides us with a competitive advantage in understanding our clients' therapies, and the challenges faced during the discovery and development process, including mechanism of action, efficacy, drug metabolism and safety assessment and toxicological testing critical for making “go/no-go” decisions.

Deep Scientific Expertise.We provide a breadth and depth of scientific expertise which may be too costly for our clients to build and/or maintain in-house.  We provide essential capabilities that our clients demand but are not perceived as strategic differentiators for their business.  These include biomarkers, biology, pharmacology, immunology, pathology and other specialty areas that have high infrastructure costs or are cost-prohibitive for clients










to maintain in-house. We continue to increase our portfolio in key therapeutic and pharmacology areas to align with our clients' internal drug discovery and development areas of focus.  These areas of focus and expertise include oncology, metabolism and obesity, immunology, bone and musculoskeletal, diabetes, cardiovascular, infectious disease and central nervous system.

Superior Quality and Client Support.We maintain scientific rigor and high quality standards through management of key performance indicators and an intense focus on biosecurity. These standards allow clients to access our global portfolio of products and services with the confidence that they will obtain consistent results no matter where they choose to obtain their products or conduct research.

Flexible and Customized Environment to Provide the Right Solutions.All of our clients are different.  Each has individual needs and specific requirements.  We understand the importance of flexibility and we can deliver customized work based upon the breadth and depth of our capabilities, expertise and services. We help clients improve their workload and staffing requirements by drawing upon the higher utilization and streamlined efficiencies of our facilities.  This allows our clients to reduce internal capacity and/or staff.  We leverage the expertise embedded in our integrated early-stage portfolio to provide customized solutions tailored to fit the specific need or therapeutic area for a particular client. We provide enhanced value to clients who use us as a full service integrated partner over several years.

Large, Global Partner.We believe there is a particular advantage in being a full service, high-quality provider of discovery and preclinicalin vivoproducts and services on a global scale.  Many of our clients, especially large biopharmaceutical companies, have decided to limit the number of suppliers with which they work, preferring to partner with Tier 1 CROs who offer and can bring experience in project management to a portfolio of capabilities. Large CROs like Charles River can present clients with access to greater value through economies of scale and scope.  This includes extensive scientific, technical and therapeutic area expertise, real-time access to data through secure portals, a global footprint, and streamlined and simplified processes and communications including professional project and relationship management. We are focused on leveraging our competitive advantages to ensure we are recognized as the premier preferred provider by building and expanding broader and deeper long-term strategic relationships with our clients.

For example, in 2012 we entered into a strategic relationship with a leading global pharmaceutical company for outsourced regulatory safety assessment and development DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics).  Utilizing our capabilities will enable this client to create a flexible research platform to deliver innovative health solutions.  And, in 2011, we expanded an existing preferred provider agreement with another leading global pharmaceutical company.  We are now this client's primary in vivo biology partner, providing non-GLP pharmacology for multiple therapeutic areas, drug metabolism and DMPK, services, and GLP safety assessment.We believe we are at an inflection point when global biopharmaceutical companies are making the decision to outsource more significant tranches of their drug discovery and development processes.

We believe it is critical to participate in that process now, because the relationships that are formed now are likely to extend for lengthy periods of time, from three to five years.  Furthermore, both the client and the CRO invest heavily in the the initial phases of the relationship, to successfully transfer work streams and establish governance processes.  Given this investment, clients are less likely to change CROs, which means that the opportunity to compete for the outsourced business may not be available again. Our goal is to prevail in the majority of these opportunities, so our strategy is focused on positioning Charles River as the preferred partner for outsourced early-stage drug discovery and development products and services.  We differentiate ourselves by our broad, early-stage portfolio, which is unique in the CRO universe; our extensive scientific expertise; our attention to client service; our best-in-class data systems and portals; and our ability to structure creative, flexible solutions that support our clients' goals of reducing the cost and improving the productivity of drug development.



We developed this strategy and focus in recognition of our clients' needs.  Biopharmaceutical companies continue to face increasing pressure to innovate and to better manage their pipelines.  Accordingly, our clients have reduced their infrastructure while simultaneously they have been searching for improved ways to identify and develop innovative new therapies.  Clients are reducing historical fixed costs in favor of a more flexible business model, with an aim to accelerate their discovery and development activities.   As a consequence, our pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients have been looking to outsource these services to high quality, full-service providers like us.  Our business prospects are driven primarily by this trend towards the virtualization and externalization of our clients through partnering and outsourcing.  Client spending is not just influenced by the levels of research and development at these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, but also by spending of all the sponsors including federal and state governments and other non-profit organizations. By providing clients with an outsourced suite of robust services from drug discovery to post-IND, we allow them to concentrate their internal expertise and resources on










areas that provide true differentiation and advance their pipelines. This creates opportunities for us to help optimize our clients' pipelines and be a true partner in accelerating their drug discovery and development process.

In recent years, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have faced a collection of challenges.  This involves scientific, public-perception, economic and regulatory challenges that all have negatively affected demand (and pricing) for outsourced discovery and preclinical development services. These challenges included:



•patent expirations of “blockbuster” therapies

•intensified actions designed to reduce costs and improve research and development innovation and productivity, including cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives;

•rationalization of drug pipelines to focus on a smaller number of programs and high-potential therapeutic areas;

•changes to government healthcare policies and funding;

•a stronger emphasis on delivering later-stage programs to accelerate drugs in clinical trials to market;

•increased pharmaceutical merger activity and the associated integration issues;

•fluctuations in the biotech funding environment; and

•the uncertain global economy.



As a result, there have been fundamental changes in our clients' research and development needs, particularly with regard to the large pharmaceutical industry.  First, these clients are increasingly emphasizing studies that have greater translation to the clinic so that they can make appropriate decisions regarding the progression of potential therapeutic entities earlier in the development process.  This has reduced the number of compounds moving into preclinical and clinical development and results in fewer molecules undergoing regulated safety assessment.  The result is a greater focus on discovery research services, includingin vivopharmacology studies consisting of efficacy and non-regulated DMPK (drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics) studies.  Second, these clients are choosing to outsource additional discovery research services in order to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of their drug research decision processes.

We believe that this changing environment will provide enhanced outsourcing opportunities for us in the future. We remain optimistic that our clients are increasingly receptive to moving towards increased outsourcing of discovery services.  With the stabilization of factors addressed above, as well as the successful launch of new therapies and the need to advance early-stage pipelines, we believe outsourcing by the pharmaceutical industry will continue to be a positive driver.

We also believe that larger biopharmaceutical companies will increasingly focus on efficiencies and execution.  They will continue to reassess what are core differentiators from research and development to commercialization.  We expect they will also continue to be conservative in re-building infrastructure and expertise.  This should lead to more opportunities for strategic outsourcing as clients choose to utilize external resources rather than invest in internal infrastructure. In the aggregate, we believe that the evolving large biopharmaceutical research and development business model will make our essential products and services even more relevant to our clients, and allow them to leverage our integrated offerings and expertise to drive their research and development efficiency and cost effectiveness.

To address the challenging market conditions that have persisted over the last few years, we have taken significant steps to better support our clients, identify new strategies to enhance client satisfaction, improve operating efficiency, and generally strengthen our business model.  Our sales force is aligned to enhance our ability to support our clients and to focus on three particular client segments: global biopharmaceutical companies, mid-tier biopharmaceutical companies, and academic/government institutions.  Our PCS business is also aligned along functional lines to continue the process of standardizing and harmonizing our procedures.  This has enabled clients to place work with us at multiple locations with the knowledge that procedures are consistently performed and data delivered in standard formats. We have begun the implementation of an ERP system in order to improve availability of, and access to, data.  In October 2011, we took the next step to further integrate our businesses by unifying RMS and PCS globally.  We did this to strengthen the linkage between the businesses, which enables us to offer clients more seamless access to our broad portfolio and scientific expertise.



We also began to take decisive actions in 2009 to reduce costs and improve operating efficiency through a combination of Lean Six Sigma process improvement initiatives and cost-savings actions.  The cost savings actions were intended to right-size our infrastructure and identify opportunities to operate more efficiently. In 2011, we initiated a program to identify and implement additional operating efficiencies. These actions were designed to streamline and optimize our operating processes and infrastructure to allow us to support our clients more efficiently and at a lower cost. In 2012, we continued these efforts










through the introduction of our Profit Improvement Program to further optimize our global footprint by identifying top and bottom-line drivers to improve efficiency and profitability.

In December 2010, we announced an intensified focus on four key initiatives designed to allow us to drive profitable growth and maximize value for shareholders, and thus better position ourselves to operate successfully in the current and future business environment. We continued to make progress in 2012 on these key initiatives:



Initiative2012 ProgressImprove our consolidated operating marginStable consolidated operating margin from continuing operations achieved due to:ŸStable Corporate costs, andŸSix-sigma and other process improvement initiativesImprove our free cash flow generationŸFree cash flow was stable and our per-share yield we believe was still the highest among public CROs.Disciplined investment in growth businessesCapital and MD&A projects invested in growth business:ŸDiagnostic laboratories opened in 2012,ŸEMD production facility in China and acquisition of   Accugenix,ŸCommitted to acquire Vital River, which establishes research model presence in China, andŸCapacity expansion in Finland DRS business.Return value to shareholdersŸRepurchased 1.7 million shares of common stock for $61.4 million.



We believe that we are well positioned to exploit both existing and new outsourcing opportunities in light of our actions and intensified focus. As clients, particularly larger pharmaceutical companies, increase their outsourcing, we believe that our expertise allows us to provide a more flexible, efficient and cost-effective alternative for them. We are able to build and maintain expertise and achieve economies of scale that are difficult for our clients to match within their internal infrastructures because these products and services are the core of our business.

We intend to continue to broaden the scope of the products and services we provide across the early-stage drug discovery and development continuum primarily through internal development, and, as needed, through focused acquisitions and alliances. Acquisitions are an integral part of our growth strategy, but we are committed to a disciplined approach that seeks to target businesses that are a sound strategic fit and that offer the prospect of enhancing shareholder value, typically including the achievement of a hurdle rate on return on invested capital above our weighted cost of capital.

This strategy may include geographic as well as strategic expansion of existing core services.  For example, in October 2012, we entered into an agreement to acquire 75% ownership of Vital River, the premier commercial provider of research models and related services in China.  For the last ten years, Vital River has been a licensee for production and distribution of our research models in China, with sites which reflect our facility design.  The acquisition closed in the first quarter of 2013.  As a result of this acquisition, we now provide high-quality research models and associated services to the emerging China market for drug discovery and development.  This strategy may also include strengthening the depth and expanding the breadth of our core capabilities and services in a related or adjacent business such as the Accugenix acquisition.

Our clients continue to consist primarily of all of the major pharmaceutical companies, many biotechnology companies, contract research organizations, agricultural and chemical companies, life science companies, veterinary medicine companies, contract manufacturing organizations, medical device companies, diagnostic and other commercial entities, as well as leading










hospitals, academic institutions, and government agencies.We have stable, long-term relationships with many of our clients. During 2012, no single commercial client accounted for more than 5% of our total net sales.



We continue to pursue a goal of expanding our relationships with our large biopharmaceutical clients, and with many of our larger mid-tier clients.  These relationships take different forms, from preferred provider arrangements to strategic partnerships.  These structured relationships incentivize clients to purchase more products and services across our early-stage portfolio, and in total, the strategic relationships in which we are now engaged represent approximately 25% of total company revenues.  This provides us better visibility than we have had in the past, and because of the strength of these relationships, better insight into our clients' planning processes. For information regarding net sales and long-lived assets attributable to both of our business segments for the last three fiscal years, please see Note 12 included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. For information regarding net sales and long-lived assets attributable to operations in the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and other countries for each of the last three fiscal years, please review Note 12 included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.



Sales, Marketing and Customer Support

We have designated dedicated sales people for each of our three client segments.  This enhances our ability to meet client needs by offering customized, tailored solutions across our entire portfolio. In addition, our mid-market pharmaceutical and biotechnology clients benefit by additional support from a combination of account managers with broad portfolio knowledge and specialists with specific scientific expertise. This allows us to provide comprehensive coverage of all of the market segments among our diverse client population.

We sell our products and services principally through our direct sales force and account management teams, the majority of whom work in North America, with the balance in Europe and the Asia-Pacific countries. In addition to interactions with our direct sales force, our primary promotional activities include organizing scientific symposia, publishing scientific papers and newsletters, webinars, and making presentations at, and participating in, scientific conferences and trade shows in North America, Europe and Asia. We supplement these scientifically based marketing activities with internet-based marketing, advertising and direct mail. In certain areas, our direct sales force is supplemented by international distributors and agents, particularly with respect to our EMDand Biopharmaceutical Services businesses.

Our internal marketing/product management teams support the field sales staff and account management teams while developing and implementing programs to create close working relationships with clients in the biomedical research industry. We maintain customer service, technical assistance and consulting service departments (in addition to project managers for our service businesses), which address both our clients' routine and more specialized needs and generally serve as a scientific resource for them. We frequently assist our clients in solving problems related to animal husbandry, health and genetics, biosecurity, preclinical study design, regulatory consulting, protocol development and other areas in which our expertise is widely recognized as a valuable resource by our clients.

Our marketing efforts are focused on stimulating demand for further outsourcing across our entire portfolio. We believe that our ability to provide solutions that address all aspects ofin vivobiology are increasingly attractive to our clients, and we continue to design and market our commercial activities to deliver flexible, customized programs designed by segment to meet our clients' global and site-specific needs.

Competition

Our goal is to be a leader in each of the markets in which we participate. We compete in the marketplace on the basis of our therapeutic and scientific expertise inin vivobiology, quality, reputation, flexibility, responsiveness, pricing, innovation and global capabilities. We are able to offer a unique portfolio of early-stage products and services to support drug discovery and development.



The competitive landscape for our two business segments varies.



•For RMS, our main competitors include three smaller companies in North America (each of whom has a global scope), and several smaller competitors in Europe and in Japan.Of our main U.S. competitors, two are privately held businesses and the third is a government funded, not-for-profit institution. We believe that none of these competitors compares to us in global reach, financial strength, breadth of product and services offerings, technical expertise or pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry relationships.










•For PCS, we believe we are one of the two largest providers of preclinical services in the world, based on net service revenue.Our commercial competitors for preclinical services consist of both publicly held and privately owned companies, and it is estimated that the top ten participants (including us) account for a significant portion of the global outsourced preclinical market, with the rest of the market remaining highly fragmented. Our PCS segment also competes with in-house departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities and teaching hospitals.



We believe that the barriers to entry in a majority of our business units are generally high and present a significant impediment for new market participants, particularly in those areas which require substantial capital expenditures, trained and specialized personnel, and mandate GLP-compliant practices.

Industry Support and Animal Welfare

One of our core values is a concern for, and commitment to, animal welfare. We have been in the forefront of animal welfare improvements in our industry, and continue to show our commitment with special recognition programs for employees who demonstrate an extraordinary commitment in this critical aspect of our business. We created our own Humane Care Initiative, which is directed by our Animal Welfare and Training Group. The goal of the initiative is to assure that we continue as a worldwide leader in the humane care of laboratory animals. Laboratory animals are an important resource that further our knowledge of living systems and contribute to the discovery of life-saving drugs and procedures. We work hand-in-hand with the scientific community to understand how living conditions, handling procedures and stress play a role in the quality and efficiency of research. As animal caregivers and researchers, we are responsible to our clients and the public for the health and well being of the animals in our care.

We support a wide variety of organizations and individuals working to further animal welfare as well as the interests of the biomedical research community. We fund scholarships to laboratory animal training programs, provide financial support to non-profit institutions that educate the public about the benefits of animal research and provide awards and prizes to outstanding leaders in the laboratory animal medicine field.

Employees

As of December 29, 2012, we had approximately 7,200 employees (including approximately 540 professionals with advanced scientific degrees, including Ph.D.s, D.V.M.s, and M.D.s).  Our employees are not unionized in the United States, although employees are unionized at some of our European facilities, consistent with local customs for our industry. We believe we have excellent relationships with our employees, based on a number of factors including employee retention and employee surveys.

Backlog

Our backlog for our PCS business segment from continuing operations was $213.9 million at December 29, 2012, as compared to $202.5 million at December 31, 2011. Our preclinical services are performed over varying durations, from short to extended periods of time, which may be as long as several years. We maintain an order backlog to track anticipated revenue from studies and projects that either have not started, but are anticipated to begin in the near future, or are in process and have not been completed. We only recognize a study or project in backlog after we have received written evidence of a client's intention to proceed. We do not recognize verbal orders as backlog.  Cancelled studies or projects are removed from backlog. We do not report backlog for our RMS business segment because turnaround time from order placement to fulfillment, both for products and services, is rapid.

We believe our aggregate backlog as of any date is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future results for a variety of reasons. First, studies vary in duration (i.e., some studies that are included in 2012 backlog may be completed in 2013, while others may be completed in later years). Second, the scope of studies may change, which may either increase or decrease their value. Third, studies included in backlog may be subject to bonus or penalty payments. Fourth, studies may be terminated or delayed at any time by the client or regulatory authorities for a number of reasons, including the failure of a drug to satisfy safety and efficacy requirements or a sponsor making a strategic decision that a study or service is no longer necessary. Delayed contracts remain in our backlog until a determination of whether to continue, modify or cancel the study has been made. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to realize all or most of the net revenues included in backlog or estimate the portion to be filled in the current year.












Regulatory Matters

As our business operates in a number of distinct operating environments and in a variety of locations worldwide, we are subject to numerous, and sometimes overlapping, regulatory environments.

The Animal Welfare Act (AWA) governs the care and use of certain species of animals used for research. The United States Congress has passed legislation which excludes laboratory rats, mice and chickens used for research from regulation under the AWA. As a result, most of our U.S. small animal research models activities and our avian vaccine services operations are not subject to regulation under the AWA. For regulated species, the AWA and attendant Animal Care regulations require producers and users of regulated species to provide veterinary care and to utilize specific husbandry practices such as cage size, shipping conditions, sanitation and, for certain species, environmental enrichment to assure the welfare of these animals. We comply with licensing and registration requirement standards set by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the care and use of regulated species. Our animal production facilities and preclinical facilities in the U.S. are accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC), a private, nonprofit, international organization that promotes the humane treatment of animals in science through voluntary accreditation and assessment programs. AAALAC covers all species of laboratory animals, including rats, mice and birds. Our preclinical business is also generally regulated by the USDA.

Our import and export of animals and our operations in foreign countries are subject to international agreements and conventions, as well as a variety of national, regional, and local laws and regulations, which establish the standards for the humane treatment, care and handling of animals by dealers and research facilities. We maintain the necessary certificates, licenses, detailed standard operating procedures and other documentation required to comply with applicable regulations for the humane treatment of the animals in our custody at our facilities.

Our manufacturing businesses produce endotoxin test kits, reagents, cell banks used in research and biopharmaceutical production, clinical trial vaccines and vaccine support products. Additionally, several of our laboratories conduct identity, stability and potency testing in support of our clients' manufacturing programs. These activities are subject to regulation by the FDA and other national regulatory agencies under their respective current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations. We are subject to inspection on a routine basis by national (FDA) and international monitoring authorities compliance with these regulations. These regulations require that we manufacture our products or perform testing in a prescribed manner with respect to cGMP compliance, and maintain records of our manufacturing, testing and control activities. We maintain a biological license with the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research that covers the manufacture and distribution of diagnostic reagents.  We also maintain an establishment license with the USDA's Center for Veterinary Biologics (CVB) for the manufacture of USDA licensed antigens, antibodies and viruses. Our Avian business manufactures and markets three USDA licensed products that are subject to regular inspection by the USDA and CVB.

All of our sites are subject to licensing and regulation under national, regional and local laws relating to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens, the handling, storage and disposal of laboratory specimens, hazardous waste and radioactive materials, and the safety and health of laboratory employees.

To ensure that all business sectors comply with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and satisfy our client expectations for quality and regulatory compliance, we established a corporate regulatory affairs and compliance organization that oversees our corporate quality system and all of our quality assurance functions.










Intellectual Property

We develop and implement computer software and technically derived procedures and products intended to maximize the quality and effectiveness of our services. Although our intellectual property rights are valuable to our success, we believe that such factors as the technical expertise, proprietary know-how, ability and experience of our professionals are more important, and that, overall, these technological capabilities provide significant benefits to our clients. Where we consider it appropriate, steps are taken to protect our know-how through confidentiality agreements and registrations. In addition, we in-license technology and products from other companies when it enhances both our product and services businesses. In the future, in-licensing may become a larger initiative to enhance our offerings, particularly as we focus on therapeutic area expertise. With the exception of technology related to our EMDtesting business, including Accugenix and the Endosafe-PTS, we have no patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises or concessions which are material and upon which any of our products or services are dependent.
