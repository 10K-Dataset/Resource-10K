of growth represented net new business, investment performance, market appreciation and favorable foreign exchange movements.

On a pro forma combined basis (as though the BGI Transaction had closed on December 31, 2008), AUM increased 23% or
$634.5 billion from $2.712 trillion at year-end 2008. Net new business during the year totaled $159.8 billion, including $219.2 billion of net inflows in long-dated and advisory AUM and $59.4 billion of outflows in cash management products. In
addition, a strong recovery in global credit and equity markets and favorable foreign exchange rate movements contributed $472.3 billion to AUM growth in 2009. At year-end, 85% of AUM was in long-dated strategies (46% in equities, 32% in fixed
income, 4% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternative investments), 10% was in cash management products and 5% was in advisory or long-term liquidation portfolios. BlackRock has realized a 58% compound annual growth rate in AUM over the past five

Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)

Overview (continued)

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility
and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period. Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following
factors:



•The Company’s diversified product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products
across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi- asset class investment solutions to address specific client needs;



•the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in,BlackRock Solutionsproducts and services;



•the Company’s global presence, with approximately 40% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving
clients of which approximately 39% of total AUM was managed for clients domiciled outside the United States and Canada; and



•the growing recognition of the BlackRock brand, the strength of the Company’s culture and the depth and breadth of its intellectual capital.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to
generate new business in investment management andBlackRock Solutionsproducts and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk
preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s
long-term success.

See additional information in Item 6, Selected Financial Data.

BlackRock reports its financial results using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”); however,
management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the
reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial
measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain prior year non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)

Overview (continued)

Operating Income, as Adjusted:

GAAP reported operating income includes certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that
ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating operating income, as adjusted.

Operating
income, as adjusted (a non-GAAP measure), excludes certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the SSR, MLIM, Quellos and BGI Transactions in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2009, respectively, transaction costs, which include advisory fees, legal
fees and consulting expenses related to the BGI Transaction, a 2007 termination fee for closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges and compensation expense associated with
appreciation / (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. These expenses have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because they have been deemed non-recurring by management and to help enhance the
comparability of this information to prior periods.

The portion of compensation expense associated with certain of BlackRock’s long-term
incentive plan (“LTIP”) awards that will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, have been excluded
because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants’ put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. A detailed discussion of the LTIP is
included in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

Compensation expense associated
with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income
(expense).

Management believes that operating income exclusive of these costs is more representative of the operating performance for the
respective periods.

Operating Margin, as Adjusted:

Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that
excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods.

Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently
or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction/integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs and fluctuations in deferred compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund
certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance to other companies. Management reviews both the GAAP and non-GAAP
financial measures.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)

Overview (continued)

Operating Margin, as Adjusted (continued):

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management
believes that excluding such costs is useful to BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted under GAAP on a net basis within investment
advisory, administration fees and securities lending revenue. Amortization of deferred mutual fund sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee
revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc.
(“Realty”). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party, these employees were retained on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed
by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as
adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting revenues.

Non-Operating Income
(Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests, as Adjusted:

Non-operating income (expense), less net income
(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with
depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income
(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.

Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides for
comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its consolidated results. As compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets
related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss)
attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating results that impact book value.

Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as Adjusted:

GAAP reported net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. and GAAP diluted earnings per common share include certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or
transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted.

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted (non-GAAP measures), exclude the after-tax impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges,
the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, LTIP expense to be funded by PNC and by a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, the SSR, MLIM,
Quellos and BGI integration costs, BGI transaction costs and the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of enacted legislation.

Products *

BlackRock offers a broad spectrum of investment
management and risk management products and services. Investment management offerings include single- and multi-asset class portfolios, which may be structured to focus on a particular investment style, capitalization range, region or market sector;
credit or maturity profile; or liability structure. Revenue from these products primarily consists of advisory fees, typically structured as a percentage of AUM. In some instances, we earn securities lending fees or performance fees, which may be
expressed as a share of earnings or a percentage of returns in excess of agreed-upon targets. In addition, BlackRock offers itsAladdin®investment system, as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under theBlackRock Solutionsname. Revenue on
these services may be based on several criteria including asset volume, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other performance objectives.

Equity

BlackRock’s equity AUM closed the year at $1.536 trillion, up 656%, or $1.333
trillion, from reported AUM of $203.3 billion at December 31, 2008. The increase was due primarily to the BGI Transaction, which contributed $1.188 trillion in acquired assets. On a pro forma combined basis, equity AUM increased 47% or $488.2
billion from $1.048 trillion at year-end 2008. The pro forma increase included $124.2 billion in net new business and $360.2 billion from investment performance (alpha) and positive market movement (beta).

BlackRock manages equity portfolios utilizing three distinct investment approaches: index or passive, active fundamental and active scientific. Index strategies employ a structured balance of risk, return
and cost to offer an efficient way to obtain exposure to equity markets. Fundamental investments seek to add value relative to a specified index or on an absolute basis primarily through security selection based on BlackRock’s proprietary
research and portfolio manager judgment. Scientific equity strategies seek superior investment outcomes through a stock selection process that aims to systematically find and exploit pricing opportunities while rigorously managing risk and cost. A
wide variety of products are offered in each of these styles, including global and regional portfolios; value, growth and core products; large, mid and small cap strategies; and selected sector funds.

Equity (continued)

At year-end 2009, index strategies represented $1.183 trillion, or 77%, of equity AUM. Active equity portfolios totaled $353.1 billion, or 23%, of equity
AUM, including $208.7 billion in active fundamental strategies and $144.3 billion in active scientific products. During the year, investors reallocated from cash earning near zero to higher risk assets, helping to fuel a strong recovery in the
global equity markets. Index strategies, including ETFs, attracted significant flows as an efficient means of gaining market exposure, in some cases pending longer-term allocations to active strategies. On a pro forma combined basis, BlackRock had
net new business of $146.8 billion in index funds and $10.4 billion in active fundamental portfolios, which more than offset $33.0 billion of net outflows in active scientific equities.

BlackRock manages equity portfolios for a diverse base of institutional and retail clients globally. At December 31, 2009, 65% of equity AUM or $1.001 trillion was managed on behalf of institutional
investors in separate accounts, collective investment trusts and mutual funds. An additional $381.4 billion or 25% of equity AUM were managed iniSharesproducts, which are purchased by both institutional and retail investors on stock
exchanges worldwide. The remaining 10%, or $153.9 billion, of equity AUM was managed for retail and high net worth investors, largely through open-end mutual funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 59%, or $912.2 billion, of our equity
AUM was managed for clients based in the United States and Canada. The remaining 41% or $623.9 billion of equity AUM included $444.5 billion managed for clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”), $167.8 billion in Asia Pacific
and $11.5 billion for investors in Latin America and Iberia. Net inflows of $124.2 billion were positive across all regions, with $56.9 billion of net new business from the United States and Canada, $46.3 billion from EMEA, $18.8 billion from Asia
Pacific and $2.1 billion from Latin America and Iberia.

Global equity markets were volatile throughout 2009, reaching their two-year lows in
March and rebounding sharply thereafter. For example, the MSCI World Index declined to a low of 172.7 in March before rebounding to 299.4 at year-end, a 73% increase from its nadir and a 32% overall return for the full year. BlackRock’s index
equity accounts closely tracked their corresponding benchmarks, with 68% of AUM achieving returns within 1% of index returns and 56% of AUM outperforming their benchmarks. Our active fundamental equity strategies maintained strong long-term track
records, with 59%, 76% and 86% of active fundamental AUM above their benchmarks (which for certain non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians), while 10%, 19% and 24% of active scientific AUM outperformed their benchmarks (which for certain
non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians) for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2009, respectively. Although active scientific equity strategies have struggled industry-wide since mid-2007, we believe in the
long-term viability of the approach and have committed substantial resources to research and development of the next generation of active scientific equity investing.

Fixed Income

BlackRock’s fixed income AUM ended 2009 at $1.056 trillion, representing an increase of $574.2 billion or 119%, over the previous year’s reported results. The BGI Transaction added $517.3
billion of AUM. On a pro forma combined basis, fixed income AUM rose 18%, or $161.0 billion. During the year, we were awarded net new business of $77.1 billion, driving 48% of the year’s increase in AUM. Investment performance and market
appreciation contributed $80.3 billion, or 50%, of the combined growth.

BlackRock offers a broad range of index and actively managed fixed income products across regions, sectors, credit quality and maturities. Actively managed strategies may employ a fundamental or
model-driven investment process. The former emphasizes risk-controlled sector rotation and security selection driven by sector experts and direct interaction with issuers and market makers, while the latter employs models to identify relative return
opportunities and to apply those results, subject to a pragmatic review of model risk, on a systematic basis across portfolios. Fixed income mandates are often tailored to client-specified liabilities, accounting, regulatory or rating agency
requirements, or other investment policies. Year-end fixed income AUM consisted of $459.3 billion, or 44%, in index portfolios and $596.3 billion in active strategies. Investors returned to the bond markets in 2009, driving a substantial tightening
in credit spreads from the historically high levels reached during 2008. Demand for fixed income offerings was strong across products, with $62.8 billion of net new business in index products, includingiShares, and $14.2 billion in active
strategies. Key areas of growth included non-dollar denominated products, such as liability driven investment solutions in the U.K., and U.S. core strategies, with $38.2 billion and $15.8 billion of net inflows, respectively, throughout the year.

Of BlackRock’s total fixed income AUM, 81%, or $860.0 billion, was managed on behalf of institutional investors, 10% or $102.5 billion
of AUM was managed iniSharesproducts, including 22 new offerings launched during 2009, and 9% or $93.2 billion was managed for retail and high net worth investors. The client base was well diversified geographically, with 54% or $572.2
billion of fixed income AUM managed for clients based in the United States and Canada. The remaining 46% or $483.4 billion of fixed income AUM included $332.4 billion managed for clients in EMEA, $143.0 billion in Asia Pacific and $8.0 billion for
investors in Latin America and Iberia. Net inflows of $38.9 billion and $45.7 billion from U.S and Canadian and EMEA clients, respectively, more than offset cumulative net outflows of $7.6 billion from clients in Asia Pacific and Latin America and
Iberia.

A significant rally in credit spreads drove strong performance in the bond markets, with the Barclays Global Aggregate Index posting
a 6.9% return for the year. BlackRock’s fixed income index accounts closely tracked their benchmarks, with 77% of accounts achieving returns within 1% of index returns and 53% of AUM outperforming their benchmarks. Our active fixed income
strategies achieved strong performance in 2009, with 79%, 33% and 40% of active fundamental AUM above their benchmarks (which for certain non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians) and 71%, 70% and 89% of active model-based AUM above their
benchmarks (which for certain non-U.S. products are based upon peer medians) for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2009, respectively.

Multi-Asset Class

In view of the growing demand for investment solutions that utilize a combination of fixed income, equities and alternative investments,
BlackRock is recognizing multi-asset class as a separate product category. Strategies include asset allocation and balanced mandates, target date and target risk funds, and fiduciary outsourcing relationships. BlackRock’s multi-asset class AUM
closed the year at $142.0 billion, an increase of 83%, or $64.5 billion, from the $77.5 billion multi-asset class AUM that was reported as part of equity and balanced AUM at December 31, 2008. TheLifePath®portfolios, the industry’s first target date funds, represented over half of the acquired AUM. On a pro forma
combined basis, multi-asset class AUM rose 33% or $35.4 billion, including $13.5 billion of net new business, largely driven by retail investors into mutual funds. The multi-asset class products were further spurred by the recovery in global
financial markets as positive market movements added another $21.5 billion throughout the year.

Asset allocation and balanced mandates represented $86.7 billion, or 61%, of total multi-asset class AUM at December 31, 2009. These products have been in strong demand by retail investors globally
seeking comprehensive investment solutions. Target date and target risk funds, including theLifePathportfolios and our newerSponsorMatch®offerings, totaled $28.8 billion or 20% of multi-asset class AUM. These retirement savings products, which are Qualified Default Investment Options under the Pension
Protection Act of 2006, utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s targeted retirement timing. Fiduciary outsourcing mandates, in which a pension plan
sponsor retains BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management, represented $24.4 billion, or 17%, of multi-asset class AUM. The remaining $2.0 billion, or 2%, of multi-asset class AUM was managed in various global
derivatives, diversified growth and relative return strategies.

BlackRock’s multi-asset class products were managed on behalf of a
well-balanced client base. At December 31, 2009, institutional investors represented 54%, or $76.7 billion, of multi-asset class AUM, while retail and high net worth investors accounted for 46% or $65.2 billion. The remaining $0.2 billion were
managed iniSharesofferings. The geographic mix was similarly diversified, with 53% or $75.8 billion of AUM managed for clients based in the United States and Canada, and 47% or $66.2 billion managed for international investors, principally
in EMEA. During the year, clients in the United States and Canada, EMEA and Latin America and Iberia awarded BlackRock net new business of $15.0 billion, which offset net outflows of $1.5 billion from clients in Asia Pacific.

Approximately 18% of BlackRock’s multi-asset class AUM is managed in portfolios that are customized to unique client requirements. The remaining
strategies have achieved competitive performance, with 69% of AUM over their benchmarks for the one year, 73% for the three years and 86% for the five years ended December 31, 2009.

Alternative Investments

BlackRock ended 2009 with $102.1 billion of AUM in its alternative investment products, a 66%, or $40.6 billion, increase as compared to reported AUM at
year-end 2008. The BGI Transaction added $49.4 billion of AUM in a variety of currency, commodity, global macro and hedge fund offerings. These products complement BlackRock’s fund of funds, real estate, hedge fund and opportunistic strategies.
Alternative AUM was adversely affected by net outflows, disbursements from opportunistic funds and declining real estate markets in 2009. In particular, while many alternative managers suspended redemptions in 2008, we were able to avoid such
drastic action throughout the financial crisis. Although this policy may have amplified redemptions in our hedge funds and funds of hedge funds, we believe our focus on putting clients’ needs first will be rewarded over time.

BlackRock’s alternative investment
products include real estate debt and equity; funds of funds; macro funds, hedge funds and other absolute return strategies; and active currency and commodity funds, as described below. The alternative investment clientele was predominantly
institutional, representing 81% or $83.1 billion of alternatives AUM.iSharescontributed another 10%, or $10.1 billion, of AUM, and retail and high net worth investors comprised the remaining 9% or $8.9 billion of ending assets. The
geographic mix was diversified, with 59% or $60.7 billion of AUM managed for clients in the United States and Canada, 23% or $23.7 billion for clients in EMEA, 17% or $17.6 billion for clients in Asia Pacific, and 1% or $62.4 million for clients in
Latin America and Iberia. Many of our alternative investment products had strong investment performance in 2009, and a number reached or surpassed their high water marks by year-end.



•Real Estate: At year-end 2009, BlackRock managed $18.1 billion in a variety of real estate debt and equity products. Offerings include high yield debt
and core, value-added and opportunistic equity portfolios. Real estate AUM decreased 30% or $7.7 billion during the year, driven by $7.3 billion in market declines and $0.4 billion of net outflows. Commercial real estate markets are expected to
continue to struggle through 2010.



•Funds of Funds: At December 31, 2009, BlackRock managed $22.1 billion of AUM in funds of funds offered under theBlackRock Alternative Advisors(“BAA”) name. Products include hedge fund, private equity and real asset funds of funds, as well as co-investment and hybrid vehicles. BAA AUM declined $0.6 billion during 2009. Net outflows of $2.9 billion principally stemming from
redemption requests submitted at the end of 2008, in addition to a disposition of a $0.2 billion real estate fund of funds portfolio, were almost fully offset by $2.5 billion of growth due to strong investment performance and market appreciation.

•Hedge Funds: BlackRock ended 2009 with $24.9 billion of AUM in a variety of fixed income and equity hedge funds, global macro funds, portable alpha,
distressed and opportunistic strategies. Offerings include both open-end hedge funds and similar products, and closed-end funds that have been created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term investment horizon.
During the year, we added $13.8 billion of AUM through the acquisitions of BGI and the R3 Capital Partners funds. On a pro forma combined basis, AUM decreased $1.4 billion, with $5.5 billion of net outflows, including $1.1 billion of disbursements
from opportunistic investments, largely offset by $1.3 billion of acquired AUM and an additional $2.8 billion of investment returns and market appreciation.



•Currency and Commodity Funds: At year-end, BlackRock managed $35.7 billion in currency and commodity mandates, the vast majority of which were acquired
through the BGI Transaction. These products include active currency and currency overlay strategies primarily managed through institutional separate accounts, and commodity portfolios primarily offered asiSharesproducts. Pro forma combined
AUM increased $6.7 billion during 2009, driven by $2.3 billion of net new business and $4.4 billion of market appreciation.

Cash Management

AUM in cash management products stood at $349.3 billion at
December 31, 2009, up $10.8 billion, or 3%, from AUM reported at year-end 2008. The BGI Transaction added $59.5 billion of AUM. The 2008 surge in cash management assets reversed in 2009, as investors tired of earning little to no return
reallocated to various long-dated strategies offering the potential for higher returns. On a pro forma combined basis, net outflows totaled $59.4 billion, resulting in a 15% decrease in spot AUM and an approximately 10% decline in average AUM
relative to 2008.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment
style that emphasizes quality, liquidity and superior client service throughout all market cycles. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. Products include taxable
and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios may be denominated in U.S. dollar, Euro or Sterling. The BGI Transaction added substantial scale in our non-dollar offerings: 63% or $37.5 billion of total acquired cash
management AUM was invested in offshore markets.

The cash management team also manages the cash we receive as collateral for securities on
loan in other portfolios. Securities lending, which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on long-dated portfolios, is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk
management. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings or a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan is reported as AUM in the corresponding asset class. The value of the cash
collateral is not included in cash management AUM.

Cash Management (continued)

Our cash management clientele remained largely institutional, with 80%, or $280.4 billion, of cash AUM managed on behalf of institutions and 19%, or $67.6
billion, managed for retail investors at year-end 2009. An additional $1.3 billion of cash AUM was managed iniSharesproducts. The investor base was also predominantly domestic, with 76% or $265.4 billion of AUM managed for U.S. and Canadian
investors and 24%, or $83.9 billion, managed for international clients, almost all of which were based in EMEA. While we suffered significant net outflows from U.S. clients reallocating out of cash, we attracted net inflows internationally where we
gained market share as a relatively new entrant. We expect cash management AUM to remain volatile, with outflows likely as the economy stabilizes and central banks end their quantitative easing programs and eventually raise interest rates.

BlackRock Solutions and Advisory

BlackRock offers investment systems, risk management, outsourcing and advisory services under theBlackRock Solutionsbrand name. Over $9.0 trillion of positions are processed on ourAladdinoperating platform, which serves as the investment system for BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors.BlackRock Solutionsalso offers comprehensive risk reporting via theGreen Package®and risk management advisory services, interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator,AnSer®, middle and back office outsourcing services and investment accounting. Clients have also retainedBlackRock Solutionsfor a variety of financial markets advisory engagements, such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet
strategies.

As the global capital markets began to recover, clients remained focused on risk management, and demand forBlackRock
Solutionscontinued to grow. During the year,BlackRock Solutionsadded 48 net new assignments and revenue increased 21% to $477 million. Growth was well balanced acrossAladdin, risk management and financial markets advisory
services. Advisory AUM increased 11% to $161.2 billion, buoyed by $11.6 billion of net inflows and $4.5 billion of growth driven by market performance in these long-term liquidation portfolios. At year-end,BlackRock Solutionsserved 130
clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

TheBlackRock Solutions, Aladdinand technology teams are also supporting key aspects of the BGI integration. These efforts, which are expected to continue through 2011, are vital to establishing a
unified operating platform and consistent operating processes. We expect the integration of BGI’s extensive quantitative tools, risk management models and portfolio construction applications across asset classes to enhance theAladdinplatform over time. Additionally, we will seek to leverage our scale for the benefit of our clients through the creation of a robust global trading platform.

Transition Management Services

BlackRock also offers transition management services,
involving the temporary oversight of a client’s assets as they transition from one manager to another or from one strategy to another. We provide a comprehensive service that includes project management and implementation based on achieving
best execution consistent with the client’s risk management tolerances. We useAladdinand other state-of-the-art tools and work closely with BlackRock’s trading cost research team to manage four dimensions of risk throughout the
transition: exposure, execution, process and operational risk. The average transition assignment is executed within two weeks, although the duration can be longer or shorter depending on the size, complexity and liquidity of the related assets.
These portfolios are not included in AUM unless BlackRock has been retained to manage the assets after the transition phase.

Competition

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks,
brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors
include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment
performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. Certain of the Company’s competitors, however, have greater marketing resources than BlackRock, particularly
in retail channels. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new business will be successful.

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are
primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, stockholders of registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) and the bank subsidiaries of Bank of
America and PNC and their customers. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as BlackRock and its subsidiaries, have broad
administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the
suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines.

Recent market disruptions have led to numerous proposals both in and outside the United States for changes in the regulation of the financial services
industry. New laws or regulations, or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business activities, could require BlackRock to change certain business practices and
could expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and tax costs) and liabilities, as well as reputational harm. Regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock
has invested directly and/or on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from
competitors.

Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by our regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the
interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock. The profitability of BlackRock also could be affected by rules and regulations that impact the business and
financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

The rules
governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the below discussion is general in nature and does not purport to be complete.

U.S. Regulation

Certain of
BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the “OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (the
“NFA”), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain BlackRock U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money
laundering regulations and economic sanctions, laws and regulations established by various agencies.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the “Advisers Act”), imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent
activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment
advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment
adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could
result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.

Regulation (continued)



U.S. Regulation (continued)



Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended
(“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain
duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require
BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.

BlackRock has two subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers, two other subsidiaries that are registered
as commodity trading advisers and three additional subsidiaries only registered as commodity pool operators with the CFTC. All seven of these subsidiaries are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system
covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Four of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”), BlackRock Capital Markets, LLC, BlackRock
Execution Services, and BlackRock Fund Distribution Company (“BFDC”) are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such
broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). BRIL and BFDC are members of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) and are subject to MSRB rules.

Regulation (continued)



U.S. Banking Regulation

Each of Bank of America and PNC is a bank holding company and a “financial holding company” regulated by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). Because the ownership interests of each of Bank of America and PNC in BlackRock exceeds 25% on an economic or voting basis, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of Bank of America
and PNC and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to Bank of America and PNC. The supervision and regulation of Bank of America, PNC and their
respective subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of their respective banking subsidiaries, their depositors, the deposit insurance funds of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the banking
system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of Bank of America, PNC or BlackRock. Bank of America’s and PNC’s relationships and good standing with their regulators are important to the conduct of
BlackRock’s business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.

BTC is a
national trust company that does not accept deposits and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital
adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations
restricting transactions with affiliates. These laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers, and not BTC, BTC’s affiliates or shareholders.

BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a “financial holding company” under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted
within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides
advisory, administrative or other services, to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new
activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of Bank of America and PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock. Bank of
America, PNC and their subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRock’s businesses.

The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the
Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRock’s business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking
laws, regulations and orders.

Any failure of either Bank of America or PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result
in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of Bank of America’s or PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized,” by any
examination downgrade of one of Bank of America’s or PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of Bank of America’s or PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.

Non-U.S. Regulation

BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. As BlackRock continues to expand its international business, a number of its
subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.

Regulation (continued)



Non-U.S. Regulation (continued)



The Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”) regulates BlackRock’s subsidiaries in the
United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA’s rules govern a firm’s capital resources
requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries.
In addition, these subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”), which came into effect on November 1, 2007
and regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. MiFID sets out more detailed requirements governing the
organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and more extensive transaction reporting requirements.

The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation, as have those other European jurisdictions (excluding Switzerland which is not
part of the EU) in which BlackRock has a presence. However, the introduction of further new regulations that will apply to BlackRock’s European activities remains likely as a result of further EU-wide legislation. A review of MiFID by the
European Commission is mandated for 2010 to report on the need for extensions to the pre- and post-trade transparency obligations and may result in further rules in this area. A new EU directive, the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive,
is currently in draft form and is likely to be implemented in 2013. This will regulate managers of, and service providers to, alternative investment funds domiciled within Europe and the marketing of all alternative investment funds into Europe.
There are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject, including in relation to regulatory capital and the protection of client assets.

In addition to the FSA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are overseen by comparable regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel
required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in China, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.

In Japan, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the
Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which
establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in
censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.

In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the “ASIC”) and the Australian
Prudential Regulatory Authority (the “APRA”). The ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. The APRA is the prudential regulator of the
Australian financial services industry and oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, friendly societies and most members of the superannuation (pension) industry. Failure to
comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)



The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures
Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and the non-bank retail leveraged foreign exchange market in Hong Kong. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”), an
independent non-governmental body. The relevant subsidiaries, and certain individuals representing them, which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are generally required to be registered or licensed with the SFC,
and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.

There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements
in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business.
