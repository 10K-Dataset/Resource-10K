Overview

BlackRock, Inc. (“BlackRock” or the “Company”) is an independent investment management firm with $3.561 trillion
of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2010. The Company is highly regulated, serves its clients as a fiduciary, and derives all of its revenues from client business. We focus exclusively on investment management and risk
management; we do not engage in proprietary trading or other activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients. Our business is global: we invest in capital markets throughout the world, we have employees in 25 countries and we serve
investors in more than 100 countries. Our clients include taxable, tax-exempt and official institutions, retail investors and high net worth individuals.

The 2009 combination of BlackRock and Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”) created a firm with unsurpassed breadth of investment expertise and risk management capabilities across the global capital
markets. Our unique platform enables us to bring together active (alpha) investments with index (beta) products and risk management to develop tailored solutions for clients. Our product range includes single- and multi-asset class portfolios
investing in equities, fixed income and/or money market instruments. We offer our products directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds,iShares®exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and other exchange traded products (together with ETFs, “ETPs”),
collective investment funds and separate accounts. We also offer ourBlackRock Solutions®(“BRS”) investment systems, risk management and advisory services to institutional investors.

BlackRock’s common stock is
publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol, “BLK”. A majority of our Board of Directors is independent, and we have no majority shareholder. On November 15, 2010, certain of BlackRock’s stockholders completed
a $9.6 billion secondary offering through the sale of 58.7 million shares held by Bank of America Corporation (“Bank of America”) through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. (“Merrill Lynch”), and
The PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (“PNC”) at a price of $163.00. None of the proceeds of the offering went to the Company. At December 31, 2010, Bank of America did not hold any of BlackRock’s voting common stock outstanding
and held approximately 7.1% of BlackRock’s capital stock. PNC held approximately 25.3% of BlackRock’s voting common stock outstanding and held approximately 20.3% of the Company’s capital stock. Barclays Bank PLC
(“Barclays”) held approximately 2.3% of BlackRock’s voting common stock outstanding and held approximately 19.6% of the Company’s capital stock.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given
period. Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:



•the Company’s diversified product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products
across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi- asset class investment solutions to address specific client needs;



•the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services;



•the Company’s global presence, with approximately 41% of employees outside the U.S. supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients
of which approximately 44% of total AUM was managed for clients domiciled outside the U.S.; and



•the growing recognition of the BlackRock brand globally, the strength of the Company’s culture and the depth and breadth of its intellectual
capital.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its
ability to generate new business in investment management andBlackRock Solutionsproducts and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with
their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract and retain talented professionals is critical to the
Company’s long-term success.

See additional information in Item 6, Selected Financial Data.

BlackRock reports its
financial results using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”); however, management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have
additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of
BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with
GAAP. Certain prior year non-GAAP data has been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Overview (continued)

Operating Income, as Adjusted:

GAAP reported operating income includes certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book
value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating operating income, as adjusted.

Operating income, as adjusted (a non-GAAP measure), excludes
certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisitions of SSRM Holdings, Inc. (“SSR”), Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”), the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (“Quellos”) and BGI,
as well as advisory fees, legal fees and consulting transaction expenses related to the BGI Transaction, a 2007 termination fee for closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges and
compensation expense associated with appreciation/(depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. These expenses have been excluded from operating income, as adjusted, because they have been deemed non-recurring by
management and to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods.

The portion of compensation expense associated with
certain of BlackRock’s long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) awards that has or will be funded through distributions to participants of shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of
which has been received, has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants’ put options, primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book
value. A detailed discussion of the LTIP funded by PNC is included in Note 15, Stock-Based Compensation, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.

Compensation expense associated with appreciation/(depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans,
which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).

Management believes that operating income exclusive
of these costs is more representative of the operating performance for the respective periods.

Operating Margin, as
Adjusted:

Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the
impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully
impact the Company’s results until future periods.

Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from
period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements, such as restructuring charges, transaction/integration costs, closed-end fund launch costs and fluctuations in deferred
compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its
performance to other companies. Management reviews both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Overview (continued)

Operating Margin, as Adjusted (continued):

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes that excluding such costs is useful to
BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities
lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable property
management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third
party, these employees were retained on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue
used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. For each of these items, BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for
such offsetting revenues.

Non-Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling
Interests, as Adjusted:

Non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted,
equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain deferred
compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, to
offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.

Management
believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this information to prior periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s
non-operating contribution to its consolidated results. As compensation expense associated with depreciation or appreciation on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the
gain/(loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, as adjusted, provides a useful measure, for both management and
investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating results that impact book value.

Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc.,
as Adjusted:

GAAP reported net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. and GAAP diluted earnings per common share include certain
significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or do not have a cash flow impact and, therefore, are excluded in calculating net income
attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted.

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share,
as adjusted (non-GAAP measures), exclude the after-tax impact of the 2008 and 2009 restructuring charges, the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, LTIP expense to be funded by PNC and by a
Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, the SSR, MLIM, Quellos and BGI integration costs, BGI transaction costs and the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax
rates as a result of enacted legislation.

AUM

AUM represents assets that we manage on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment
management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management
or other forms of non-discretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis (for example, in a transition management mandate, as described below).







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Overview (continued)

Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of net asset value. On some products, we earn securities lending
fees. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. In addition, BlackRock offers itsAladdin®investment system, as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue on these services may be
based on several criteria including asset volume, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.

At
December 31, 2010, AUM was $3.561 trillion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 51% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through net new business and mergers, including the acquisitions of MLIM in 2006,
the fund of funds business of Quellos in 2007 and BGI in 2009. These acquisitions significantly changed our AUM mix, from predominantly fixed income in 2005 to a broadly diversified product range spanning asset classes and investment styles, as
described below.

At year-end 2010, products invested primarily in long-term assets represented 88% of total AUM or $3.131 trillion, of which 54% were equity mandates, 36%
fixed income accounts, 6% multi-asset class portfolios and 4% alternative investments. The remaining AUM was in cash management products and advisory mandates, which are long-term portfolio liquidation assignments. Net new business in long-term
products totaled $131.2 billion, before giving effect to merger-related outflows (see below). Net inflows in long-term products were offset by net outflows in cash management products, as money market fund yields remained near zero and net
distributions from advisory portfolios.

Unless stated otherwise, net new business figures are before giving effect to merger-related outflows
of $121.0 billion, or less than 7% of the $1.8 trillion of AUM acquired in the BGI Transaction. The annualized investment advisory base fee loss associated with merger-related outflows is less than approximately $175 million.

Equity and Fixed Income

Equity and fixed income AUM include a wide range of active and passive strategies. In total, equity AUM increased $158.4 billion or 10% to $1.694
trillion at year-end 2010. Growth was driven by $69.1 billion of net new business and $197.1 billion of investment performance and market appreciation. Fixed income AUM ended 2010 at $1.141 trillion, up $85.7 billion or 8% relative to
December 31, 2009. Net new business contributed $36.0 billion of the growth, while markets and investment performance contributed $66.1 billion. Merger-related outflows totaled $99.4 billion and $19.9 billion in equities and fixed income,
respectively, primarily due to manager concentration and underperformance in scientific active equities. (See additional discussion under “AUM by Style,” below.)

Multi-Asset Class

BlackRock’s multi-asset class AUM ended 2010 at $185.6 billion, an
increase of 31% or $43.6 billion. During the year, we were awarded $26.3 billion of net new business and portfolio values rose $13.9 billion. BlackRock’s multi-asset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates that leverage our broad
investment expertise in global equities, currencies, bonds and commodities and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments, as well as tactical
asset allocation overlays. The products are described briefly below.

BlackRock’s multi-asset class products were managed on behalf of a
well-balanced client base. At December 31, 2010, institutional investors represented 56% of multi-asset class AUM, while retail and high net worth investors accounted for 44%. Flows were almost evenly split as well, with $15.3 billion or 59%
and $10.7 billion or 41% coming from institutional and retail and high net worth investors, respectively. The geographic mix was similarly diversified, with 59% of multi-asset class AUM managed for clients based in the Americas, 32% in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 9% in Asia-Pacific. During the year, clients in the Americas and EMEA awarded BlackRock net new business of $26.6 billion, which offset net outflows of $0.5 billion from clients in Asia-Pacific.



•Asset allocation and balanced productsrepresented 59% or $109.8 billion of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, up $23.0 billion on the strength
of net new business of $14.0 billion and favorable investment performance and market movements of $9.0 billion. Our industry leading global allocation funds surpassed $70 billion in AUM in 2010.



•Target date and target risk fundsended the year at $41.9 billion, or 23% of multi-asset class AUM, driven by net inflows of $7.5 billion, a
year-over-year organic growth rate of 26% and portfolio appreciation of $4.5 billion. Products include ourLifePathandLifePath Retirement Income®offerings, which are Qualified Default Investment Alternatives under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. These products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model
that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing.



•Fiduciary management servicesaccounted for 15% or $28.6 billion of multi-asset class AUM at December 31, 2010. AUM increased $4.1 billion
during the year. These are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. Customized services include tailoring investment strategy to client-specific risk
budgets and return objectives, working closely with the client’s investment staff and trustees.

Volatile investor
sentiment presented challenges for asset allocation strategies in 2010. While 35% of multi-asset class AUM achieved returns above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one year, longer-term results remained strong, with 81% of multi-asset class
AUM outperforming for the three years and 87% for the five years ended December 31, 2010.

Alternative Investments

BlackRock ended 2010 with $109.7 billion of AUM in its alternative investment products, an increase of $7.6 billion. Net outflows totaled $0.1 billion,
as withdrawals and disbursements in real estate, currency and opportunistic funds were offset by inflows in single- and multi-strategy hedge funds, global macro funds, funds of hedge funds and commodity products. We believe that as investors adapt
their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives in the current environment, they will continue to increase their use of alternative investments to complement their core holdings.

The alternative investment client base was predominantly institutional, representing 75% or $81.8 billion of alternatives AUM with retail and high
net worth investors comprising 8% or $9.3 billion of AUM at December 31, 2010.iSharescomprised $18.6 billion or 17% of ending AUM. The geographic mix was well diversified, with 55% of AUM managed for clients in the Americas, 24%
for clients in EMEA and 21% for clients in Asia-Pacific.

During 2010, we launched BlackRock Alternative Investors (“BAI”) to
coordinate our alternative investment efforts, including product management, business development and client service. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.



•Real estatedebt and equity products managed by BlackRock totaled $12.9 billion at year-end. Offerings include high yield debt and core,
value-added and opportunistic equity portfolios. Real estate AUM decreased $5.5 billion during the year, driven by $3.3 billion in net outflows and $2.2 billion in market declines. Market performance rebounded for U.S. funds in 2010 and showed
continued strength in the U.K. and within separate accounts.



•Funds of fundsAUM increased $1.8 billion or 8% to $23.9 billion at December 31, 2010, including $18.5 billion in funds of hedge funds and
hybrid vehicles and $5.4 billion in private equity fund of funds. During the year, growth was driven by net inflows of $0.5 billion and $1.3 billion of investment and market performance. Performance was strong and a growing number of institutional
clients worldwide sought our expertise in customized accounts and commingled vehicles.



•Hedge fundsended the year with $25.9 billion of AUM in a variety of single-strategy, multi-strategy and global macro hedge funds, as well as
portable alpha, distressed and opportunistic offerings. Products include both open-end hedge funds and similar products and closed-end funds that have been created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term
investment horizon. Growth of $1.1 billion primarily came from $0.6 billion of net inflows into fixed income and multi-strategy hedge funds and strong investment and market performance of $1.8 billion across all strategies.



•Currency and commodity mandatestotaled $45.6 billion at year-end 2010. These products include a range of active and passive products primarily
managed through institutional separate accounts. AUM increased $10.0 billion during the year, driven by $2.8 billion of net inflows, primarily in commodities and currency overlays and $7.1 billion of market appreciation. OuriSharescommodities products represented $18.6 billion of AUM, which are not eligible to pay performance fees.

Cash Management and Securities Lending

AUM in cash management products totaled $279.2 billion at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $70.1 billion, or 20%, from AUM reported at year-end 2009. Investors continued to look for higher returns by
reallocating balances to deposits and operations and to a lesser extent, longer-term investment products. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios may be denominated in
U.S. dollar, euro or pound sterling.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Products (continued)

Our cash management clientele is largely institutional, with 85% of cash AUM managed for institutions and 15% for retail and high net worth investors at year-end 2010. The investor base was also
predominantly domestic, with 75% managed for investors in the Americas and 25% for clients in other regions, almost all EMEA-based. We suffered net outflows during the year, as investors sought higher yields in bank deposits, direct money market
investments and as they became more confident of the market recovery, in longer-term assets. Clients also used their cash for operating purposes, as business investment increased and merger and acquisition activity increased. We expect these trends
to continue, which will continue to put pressure on cash management flows.

The cash management team also invests the cash we receive as
collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Securities lending, which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on long-term portfolios, is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary
technology and disciplined risk management. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings and/or a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the
corresponding asset class in AUM. The value of the cash or securities collateral is not included in cash management AUM.

The combination of
the legacy businesses, along with the addition of new lending mandates, has increased lendable inventory and solidified BlackRock as a top tier provider of lendable assets. Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $104 billion, down
slightly from $111 billion at year-end 2009. Balance volatility throughout 2010 was lower than in recent years. Demand remained weak, as relatively few securities command premium lending fees. This trend is expected to continue through 2011, with a
turnaround occurring when the end-borrowers of securities begin re-risking and putting their capital to work with more conviction.

BlackRock
employs a conservative investment style that emphasizes quality, liquidity and superior client service throughout all market cycles. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment
process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Risk Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In
the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed and no such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company.
To the extent that daily evaluation/reporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk
limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.

Long-term1product offerings include active and passive (index) strategies. The investment objective for active portfolios is to
earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle (alpha). In contrast, passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of the corresponding index (beta), generally by investing in the securities that comprise the
index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate the risk and return profile of the index.

The BGI Transaction included an
at-scale index business that materially changed BlackRock’s AUM mix. Index AUM, including institutional andiSharesproducts, increased from 4% of AUM at year-end 2008 (prior to the BGI Transaction) to 54% of AUM at December 31,
2010.

Although many clients use both active and passive strategies, the profile of these assets differs greatly. For example, clients often
use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager. This has the effect of increasing turnover on index AUM. In addition, institutional index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion
dollars) and priced at low fee rates. This has the effect of exaggerating the significance of net flows in institutional index on BlackRock’s earnings.

We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive
security selection and portfolio construction. At year-end 2010, active long-term AUM increased $18.0 billion to $1.190 trillion at year-end, of which 28% was in equities, 50% in fixed income, 15% in multi-asset and 7% in alternatives. Favorable
markets contributed $89.4 billion of growth, which was slightly offset by $2.0 billion of net outflows. AUM growth was significantly hampered by merger-related outflows of $64.6 billion, primarily in scientific active equities (“SAE”).

Active Equity

BlackRock’s active equity AUM closed the year at $334.5 billion, a decline of 4%, or $14.0 billion relative to year-end 2009. Net new business
contributed $2.6 billion of growth, while investment and market performance added $41.7 billion. A wide variety of products are offered, including global and regional portfolios; value, growth and core products; large, mid and small cap strategies;
and selected sector funds. We believe an improving U.S. economy, strong corporate balance sheets, and sustained strong growth in the emerging markets bodes well for equity markets in 2011, although geopolitical risk remains a potential drag on
investor sentiment.

BlackRock manages active equity portfolios for a diverse base of institutional and retail and high net worth investors
globally. At December 31, 2010, approximately half of active equity AUM ($165.8 billion) was managed on behalf of institutional investors in separate accounts, collective investment trusts and mutual funds and half ($168.7 billion) for retail
and high net worth investors, largely through open-end mutual funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 46% of our active equity AUM was managed for investors based in the Americas, 39% in EMEA and 15% in Asia-Pacific.



•Fundamental active equityended 2010 with $239.1 billion in AUM. Net inflows of $3.9 billion in equity dividend, global, European and other
regional strategies were offset by outflows of $0.2 billion in U.S. equity funds. Market appreciation of $30.4 billion bolstered AUM as equity markets rebounded late in the year. BlackRock’s fundamental active equity investors seek to add value
relative to a specified index or on an absolute basis primarily through security selection based on proprietary research and portfolio manager judgment. Performance was strong in European and emerging market products, as well as selected sector
funds including: energy, natural resources and health sciences. In total, 62%, 65% and 77% of fundamental active equity AUM beat their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2010, respectively.
During the year, we drew on existing talent to fill out the leadership team and attracted an experienced CIO for our U.S. fundamental active equity strategies.

•Scientific active equityAUM declined 32% to $95.4 billion. Portfolio appreciation of $11.4 billion was insufficient to overcome BGI
merger-related outflows of $52.6 billion, much of which was anticipated due to underperformance dating back to 2007 in key developed market products. SAE strategies seek superior investment outcomes through a stock selection process that aims to
systematically find and exploit pricing opportunities, while rigorously managing risk and cost. During the year, we appointed a new head of the SAE business, who reorganized the team and instilled a strong performance culture that has begun to
stabilize the asset base. Though still nascent, there are early signs of improvement, as 55%, 45% and 36% of SAE AUM outperformed their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2010, respectively.

Active Fixed Income

BlackRock’s active fixed income AUM ended 2010 at $592.3 billion, a slight decrease of 1% or $3.3 billion, from the previous year’s results. During the year, we had $22.1 billion of net
outflows, partially offset by $32.3 billion of investment and market performance. Fixed income mandates are often tailored to client-specified liabilities, accounting, regulatory or rating agency requirements, or other investment policies. U.S.
bonds enjoyed good absolute returns in 2010. Despite a slight pullback during the fourth quarter, the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index returned 6.5% for the year. While sovereign credit risk remains a concern, particularly in parts of Europe,
inflation is not expected to have a material impact on Federal Reserve policy in 2011.

Of BlackRock’s total active fixed income AUM, 82%
was managed on behalf of institutional investors and 18% for retail and high net worth investors. The client base reflects our historical roots, with 69% of active fixed income AUM managed for investors in the Americas, 23% for EMEA domiciled
clients, and 8% for investors in the Asia-Pacific region. Net inflows of $1.3 billion from Asia-Pacific clients were more than offset by outflows of $23.4 billion from investors in the Americas and EMEA.



•Fundamental fixed incomeAUM totaled $553.5 billion, or 93% of active fixed income AUM, at year-end 2010. These products emphasize
risk-controlled sector rotation and security selection driven by sector experts and direct interaction with issuers and market makers. Fundamental strategies experienced net outflows of $10.2 billion largely driven by client changes in overall asset
allocation and long-term performance concerns. In addition, $8.8 billion of fixed income assets, on which we have been waiving fees for more than a year, transferred to cash management. Market appreciation contributed $30.5 billion to ending AUM.
Positive flows in U.S. municipal bonds of $2.0 billion were buoyed by the successful launch of the $1.2 billion Build America Bond Trust in the third quarter of the year. Fundamental taxable fixed income strategies achieved strong performance in
2010, with 72%, 49% and 49% of AUM above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ended December 31, 2010, respectively.



•Model-driven fixed incomeAUM declined $3.9 billion or 9%, ending the year at $38.8 billion. Investment and market performance of $1.7 billion
was insufficient to overcome $3.2 billion of outflows. These strategies employ models to identify relative return opportunities and to apply those results, subject to a pragmatic review of model risk, on a systematic basis across portfolios.
Performance in our model-driven fixed income strategies was mixed, with 66%, 81% and 92% of AUM above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2010, respectively.

Multi-Asset and Alternatives

Virtually all (98%) of AUM in multi-asset class mandates, and the majority (75%) of AUM in alternative investments are managed in active strategies. These products are discussed earlier. (See

Institutional index AUM, generally managed in common trust funds or separate accounts, comprised 38% of total AUM at December 31, 2010. AUM growth
was driven by net new business of $89.2 billion and market appreciation of $143.9 billion. Merger-related outflows of $55.3 billion were concentrated among a relatively small number of clients. Where possible, we worked with these investors to
address manager concentration issues by reallocating commoditized, low fee AUM, while retaining significant relationships and opportunities.



•Equity products comprised 68% of institutional index AUM, ending the year at $911.8 billion, driven by net inflows of $44.6 billion and $110.4 billion
of market appreciation. Net inflows in global, U.S. equity and other regional strategies were partially offset by outflows of $2.7 billion in other low fee currency overlays for equity strategies. Toward the end of the year, investors began to
reallocate to higher return asset classes, helping to fuel a recovery in the global equity markets. Institutional index equity portfolios closely tracked their respective benchmarks, with 97%, 96% and 98% of AUM at or above tracking error tolerance
for one-, three-, and five-year periods.



•Fixed income products represented 32% or $425.9 billion of institutional index AUM, an increase of 19% or $68.4 billion. Net new business totaled $39.1
billion fueled by $12.8 billion of net inflows primarily in liability hedging strategies. Investors remained risk averse largely due to the European sovereign debt crisis in the first half of the year, favoring low risk fixed income exposures. As
global markets stabilized and a recovery in the U.S. looked increasingly likely, equity markets recovered and investor confidence returned. Institutional index fixed income portfolios closely tracked their respective benchmarks, with 92%, 94% and
98% of AUM at or above tracking error tolerance for one-, three-, and five-year periods.



•Less than 1% of institutional index AUM is in alternatives or multi-asset class products. (See discussions under “Products — Asset

iSharesis the leading ETF provider in the world, with $590.2 billion of AUM at December 31, 2010, an increase of $96.0
billion or 19% since year-end 2009. We were the top asset gatherer globally in 20102, with $44.0 billion of net inflows complemented by $52.0 billion of market appreciation. We also introduced 78 new ETPs during the year, maintaining our dual commitment to innovation and responsible
product structuring. Our broad product range offers investors the building blocks required to assemble diversified portfolios and implement tactical asset allocation strategies and the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures
quickly and cost-efficiently.

The market for ETPs continues to grow globally, with investor preference driven to varying degrees by
performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding index), liquidity (bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. Flows also reflect investor risk appetite,
which shifted toward fixed income and, within equities, to broad and single country emerging market funds in 2010. In early 2011, investors have begun to shift equity allocations back to developed markets.

At year-end, ouriSharesproduct mix included $448.2 billion, or 76%, in equity offerings, and $123.1 billion, or 21%, in bond ETPs. The remaining

BlackRock Solutions and Advisory

BlackRock offers investment systems, risk management, outsourcing and advisory services under theBlackRock Solutionsbrand name. Over $10.0 trillion of positions are processed on ourAladdinoperating platform, which serves as the investment system for BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting via theGreen Package®and risk management advisory services, interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator,AnSer®, middle and back office outsourcing services and investment accounting. Clients have also retained
BRS’ Financial Markets Advisory (“FMA”) group for a variety of engagements, such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance
sheet strategies.

As global capital markets have recovered, clients have focused more on risk management, and demand for BRS services
continues to be robust. During the year, BRS added 62 net new assignments. While revenue declined modestly by 4% to $460 million, demand was strong forAladdinand risk management services, with year-over-year revenue growing 14%,
particularly in EMEA where we signed a record number of new BRS clients onto the platform.Aladdinassignments are long-term contracts providing significant recurring revenue.

During the year we added 49 new FMA assignments and completed 33 engagements. The nature of FMA assignments shifted from urgent, short-term risk analyses to longer term advisory and risk monitoring
engagements, with year-over-year revenue declining 23%, as the crisis subsided and fewer clients required emergency valuation and liquidation services. Advisory AUM decreased 7% to $150.7 billion, with $1.5 billion of market appreciation
insufficient to offset $12.0 billion of client distributions in these long-term liquidation portfolios.

At year-end, BRS served 149 clients,
including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. During the year, BlackRock acquired and integrated Helix Financial Group
LLC to enhance BRS’commercial real estate capabilities, which proved to be critical to BRS’success in winning several high profile assignments. We will continue to consider acquisition opportunities that can expandAladdinfunctionality and our risk management expertise.

The BRS and Aladdin teams are also supporting key aspects of the BGI
integration. These efforts are vital to establishing a unified operating platform and consistent operating processes. We expect functionality added in connection with the integration to enhance theAladdinplatform over time. Additionally, we
will seek to leverage our scale for the benefit of our clients through the creation of a robust global trading platform and other initiatives.

Transition Management Services

BlackRock also offers transition management services,
involving the temporary oversight of a client’s assets as they transition from one manager to another or from one strategy to another. We provide a comprehensive service that includes project management and implementation based on achieving
best execution consistent with the client’s risk management tolerances. We use state-of-the-art tools and work closely with BlackRock’s trading cost research team to manage four dimensions of risk throughout the transition: exposure,
execution, process and operational risk. The average transition assignment is executed within two weeks, although the duration can be longer or shorter depending on the size, complexity and liquidity of the related assets. These portfolios are not
included in AUM unless BlackRock has been retained to manage the assets after the transition phase.

BlackRock serves institutional and retail and high net worth investors in more than 100 countries through the efforts of professionals located in 25 countries. We strive to leverage our global expertise
and scale, together with our understanding of local requirements and business customs, to most effectively serve our clients. Portfolios may be invested in local, regional or global capital markets. Products may be structured to address
location-specific issues, such as regulations, taxation, operational infrastructure, market liquidity, and client-specific issues, such as investment policy, liability structure and ratings.

In order to enhance our ability to best serve our clients and develop our talent, we modified our matrix organizational structure in 2010 to reinforce the teamwork required among global functions and
regions. The global functions — Portfolio Management, BRS, Global Clients, and Corporate & Business Operations — are key to driving coordination and consistency, and to achieving the benefits of our scale. The regions —
Americas, EMEA, and Asia-Pacific — support local clients, employees, regulators and business strategy. At December 31, 2010, 44% of our AUM was managed for clients outside the U.S., and 41% of employees were based outside the U.S. We
expect these figures to approach 50% over the coming years.

Americas

At year-end 2010, assets managed on behalf of clients domiciled in the Americas (defined as the U.S., Caribbean, Canada, Latin America and Iberia), totaled $2.177 trillion or 61% of total AUM, an increase
of $118.8 billion or 6% in 2010. Growth was driven by $78.4 billion in net new business in long-term products and $177.3 billion in investment performance and market appreciation. Clients are served through offices in Brazil, Canada, Chile, Mexico,
Spain and throughout the U.S.

Offerings include closed-end funds andiSharestraded on domestic stock exchanges, a full range of
open-end mutual funds, collective investment funds, common trusts, private funds and separate accounts. The long-term product mix is well diversified and proportional to the firm’s mix: 57% in equities, 34% in fixed income, 6% in multi-asset
class and 3% in alternatives. By comparison, cash management offerings predominantly serve clients in the Americas. We also have a wide variety of BRS assignments for institutional investors and governmental entities in the U.S. and Canada.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Clients (continued)

The mix by investment style is also balanced, with 39% of long-term AUM managed in active products, 35% in institutional index accounts and 26% iniSharesand other ETPs at year-end. Note that theiSharesfigures are based on the jurisdiction of the fund, rather than the underlying investor. Non-U.S. investors often prefer U.S.iShares, primarily due to the depth of the
markets and liquidity of the products.

EMEA

AUM for clients based in EMEA ended the year at $1.017 trillion or 29% of total AUM, an increase of $79.7 billion from 2009. During the year, clients awarded us net new business of $28.0 billion,
including inflows from investors in 24 countries across the region. Our offerings include fund families in the U.K., Luxembourg and Dublin, andiShareslisted on stock exchanges throughout Europe, as well as separate accounts and pooled
investment products.

Clients invested across the entire product spectrum with 51% of long-term AUM in equities, 40% in fixed income, 6% in
multi-asset class and 3% in alternatives. EMEA clients constitute the remaining 25% of our cash management AUM, and represent just 3% of our advisory AUM. BRS has steadily built its presence in EMEA, includingAladdinrelationships with a
variety of institutional investors and FMA engagements for financial services companies and official institutions, including the valuation assignment announced in January 2011 for the Central Bank of Ireland.

The mix by investment style is slightly more concentrated than in the Americas, with 36% invested in active products, 53% in institutional index accounts
and 11% iniSharesand other ETPs. The relatively higher percentage in institutional index is driven by low fee institutional liability hedging portfolios which account for approximately 25% of total institutional index assets. The relatively
lower percentage iniSharesprimarily reflects the fact that the European ETP market is at an earlier stage of development.

Asia-Pacific

Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan,
Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, and joint ventures in China and India. At December 31, 2010, we managed $367.2 billion of AUM for clients in the region, an increase of 5% or $16.2 billion from 2009. Net new business
contributed $15.4 billion, and the remainder of the increase was attributable to investment performance and favorable market movements. We also acquired the Taiwan-based asset manager Primasia Investment Trust Co. Ltd, strengthening our onshore
investment capabilities by offering locally managed investment solutions.

At year-end, the mix of long-term products managed for these
clients consisted of 46% equities, 43% fixed income, 5% multi-asset class and 6% alternative investments. Asia-Pacific clients represented 2% of our advisory AUM and less than 1% of our cash management AUM. BRS served a select number of the largest
and most sophisticated investors in the region.

The mix among investment styles was more tilted toward institutional index accounts than in
the other regions, with $219.9 billion or 61% of long-term AUM in these products. This bias can be traced to the presence of very large governmental institutions and pensions that are heavy users of index products. Asia-Pacific institutional
investors also useiSharesfor tactical allocation, but often favor the liquidity of the U.S. products (which are counted in AmericasiShares). Active mandates represented 36% of AUM managed for investors in the region at year-end.

(1)Based on jurisdiction of fund, not underlying client.

We serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities,
foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third party
fund sponsors; and retail and high net worth investors. We also serve both institutional and retail and high net worth investors who acquireiShareson exchanges worldwide (iSharesis discussed under “Products,” above).

Institutional Investors

Assets managed for institutional investors totaled $2.556 trillion or 72% of total AUM at year-end 2010. During the year, net new business, excluding merger-related outflows, in long-term products totaled
$60.3 billion, which was partially offset by $38.4 billion of net outflows in cash management and $12.0 billion of net distributions in advisory assignments. Investment performance and market appreciation contributed $201.2 billion of additional AUM
growth.

Clients (continued)

BlackRock’s institutional AUM is well diversified by both product and region. Long-term AUM was $2.167 trillion at year-end, 49% of which was in
equities, 42% fixed income, 5% multi-asset class and 4% alternatives. The mix by investment style was 38% active and 62% passive (excluding institutional investors iniShares). As noted earlier, institutional index accounts tend to be very
large mandates managed for relatively low fee rates and subject to higher turnover.

We serve institutional investors on six continents, with
55% of AUM managed on behalf of investors in the Americas, 32% in EMEA and 13% in Asia-Pacific. Institutional clients are further diversified by sub-segments: tax-exempt, official institutions, taxable and cash investors, as described below.



•BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world, with $1.487 trillion, or 58%, of institutional AUM managed for defined
benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2010. An additional $57.0 billion was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments. Assets
managed for these clients grew $90.4 billion during 2010, including $18.4 billion of net inflows from defined contribution plans, which represent an important and growing component of the retirement market.



•We also managed $245.4 billion or 10% of institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals,
multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies. These clients often require specialized investment policy advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support. In addition, BRS has been selected by a number of official
institutions to provide a range of services, includingAladdin, risk management and financial markets advisory assignments.



•BlackRock is the top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $218.6 billion or 9% of institutional AUM at year-end.
These clients awarded us $4.6 billion of net new business, driven by a trend toward outsourcing, particularly in Europe last year. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third party fund sponsors for which
we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $326.6 billion or 13% of institutional AUM at year-end.



•The remaining $221.7 billion or 9% of institutional AUM was managed on behalf of taxable and tax-exempt institutions invested in our cash management
products at December 31, 2010. See the Product section above for additional information on our cash management AUM.

Retail and High Net Worth Investors

BlackRock serves retail and high net worth investors
globally through separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. At December 31, 2010, assets managed for retail and high net worth investors totaled $414.7 billion, up 8%, or $31.3 billion, versus
year-end 2009 AUM. During the year, net inflows of $26.9 billion in long-term products were partially offset by $21.9 billion of net outflows in money market funds. Investment performance and market appreciation contributed $31.1 billion of
additional AUM growth.

Retail and high net worth investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks,
trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $318.2 billion or 77% of retail and high net worth AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment
funds and separately managed accounts. The product mix is well diversified, with 47% of long-term AUM in equities, 29% in fixed income, 22% in multi-asset class and 2% in alternatives. The vast majority (98%) of long-term AUM is invested in
active products, although this is partially inflated by the fact thatiSharesis shown independently, since we cannot identify all of the underlying investors.

The client base is also diversified geographically, with 68% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 23% in EMEA, and 9% in Asia-Pacific. The remaining $40.7 billion, or 10%, of
retail and high net worth AUM is invested in cash management products, principally money market funds offered in the U.S. Our success in each of these regions reflects strong relationships with intermediaries and an established ability to deliver
our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.

Competition

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes,
insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for
AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has
competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. Certain of the Company’s competitors, however,
have greater marketing resources than BlackRock, particularly in retail channels. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing
AUM and to attract new business will be successful.

Regulation

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are
primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”) and the bank subsidiaries of Bank of America
and PNC and their customers. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as BlackRock and its subsidiaries, have broad
administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the
suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. The rules governing the regulation of financial
institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature and does not purport to be complete.

Regulatory Reform

Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect
the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general,
including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)

U.S. Regulation

BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the
“DOL”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the “OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures
Association (the “NFA”), the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist
financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions, laws and regulations established by various agencies.

The
Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations
and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment
companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to
termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities
laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations
promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries
under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against
losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)

BlackRock has two subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers, two other subsidiaries that are registered
as commodity trading advisers and three additional subsidiaries only registered as commodity pool operators with the CFTC. All seven of these subsidiaries are members of the NFA. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system
covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Four of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”),
BlackRock Capital Markets, LLC, BlackRock Execution Services, and BlackRock Fund Distribution Company (“BFDC”) are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with
FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). BRIL and BFDC are members of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
(“MSRB”) and are subject to MSRB rules.

U.S. Banking Regulation

Each of Bank of America and PNC is a bank holding company and a “financial holding company” regulated by the Federal Reserve under the Bank
Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). Based on Bank of America’s and PNC’s current and/or prior ownership interests in BlackRock, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of Bank of America and PNC and
is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to Bank of America and PNC. The supervision and regulation of Bank of America, PNC and their respective
subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of their respective banking subsidiaries, their depositors, the deposit insurance funds of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the banking system as a
whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of Bank of America, PNC or BlackRock. Bank of America’s and PNC’s relationships and good standing with their regulators are important to the conduct of
BlackRock’s business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.

BTC is a
national trust company that does not accept deposits and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital
adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations
restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers, and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates or BlackRock’s shareholders.

BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a “financial holding company” under the BHC Act. Investment management
is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and
private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon
applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of Bank of America and PNC to extend credit to or
conduct other transactions with BlackRock. Bank of America, PNC and their subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth
of BlackRock’s businesses.

The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock
from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRock’s business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties
for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s non-bank affiliates, such as BlackRock.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)

Any failure of either Bank of America or PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain
BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of Bank of America’s or PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized,” by any examination downgrade of one of Bank of
America’s or PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of Bank of America’s or PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the DFA broadened the
requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by now also requiring the holding company to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.”

Non-U.S. Regulation

BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and
regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies. As BlackRock continues to expand its international presence, a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems
comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.

The Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”) currently regulates
certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA’s rules govern
a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the
Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. The U.K. government has announced that it intends to abolish the FSA and to establish three new regulatory bodies, the Financial Policy Committee, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial
Conduct Authority in its place. More detailed proposals, including draft legislation, are expected early in 2011 with the aim being for the new regulatory structure to be in place by the end of 2012.

In addition to the above, the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European
regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”), which came into effect on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services throughout the European Economic Area, as well as the
Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade
transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.

The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules
into national legislation, as have those other European jurisdictions (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU) in which BlackRock has a presence. A review of MiFID by the European Commission is in process and is likely to result in
further regulation including changes to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements. It may also result in changes to other areas, such as firms’ conduct of business
requirements. In addition, the new EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive has been approved by the European Parliament in final form and is likely to be implemented by the summer of 2013. This directive will regulate managers of, and
service providers to, alternative investment funds domiciled within Europe and the marketing of all alternative investment funds into Europe. There are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject, including in
relation to regulatory capital and the protection of client assets.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be
reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations. UCITS IV, the next iteration of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”) directive, is required to be adopted in the national
law of each EU member state by July 1, 2011. This directive will introduce a requirement for UCITS funds to provide a key investor information document. There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve
retail investor protection and create a consistent framework and approach for certain insurance wrap products (referred to in the United Kingdom as packaged retail investment products), and regarding UCITS V, which is addressing, among other items,
custodial liability. In the United Kingdom, the Bribery Act 2010, which is not yet in effect, will impose additional burdens on the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In addition, a retail distribution review has been initiated by the FSA,
and is expected to change how investment advice is paid for in the United Kingdom for all investment products. Final retail distribution rules are expected in early 2011, with implementation to occur by the end of 2012.

In addition to the FSA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are overseen by comparable regulators in
Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other
things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are
regulated in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.

In Japan, certain BlackRock
subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency
(the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative
proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.

In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the
“ASIC”) and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority (the “APRA”). The ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. The APRA is
the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry and oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, general insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, friendly societies and most members of the superannuation
(pension) industry. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.

The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and the non-bank
retail leveraged foreign exchange market in Hong Kong. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”), an independent non-governmental body. The relevant subsidiaries, and certain individuals representing
them, which conduct business in any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are generally required to be registered or licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time.

There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries are
authorized to conduct business.
