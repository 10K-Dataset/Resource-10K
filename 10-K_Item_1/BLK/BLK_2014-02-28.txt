OVERVIEW

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK; together, with its subsidiaries,
unless the context otherwise indicates, “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is the world’s largest publicly traded investment management firm with employees in more than 30 countries who serve clients in over 100 countries across
the globe. We provide a broad range of investment and risk management services and had $4.324 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2013. Our clients include retail, including high net worth, and institutional
investors, comprised of pension funds, official institutions, endowments, insurance companies, corporations, financial institutions, central banks and sovereign wealth funds. The Company is highly regulated and serves its clients as a fiduciary. We
do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.

Our unique platform enables us to offer active and passive
products and risk management capabilities to develop tailored solutions for clients. Our product range includes single- and multi-asset portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and/or money market instruments. We offer our
products directly and through intermediaries in a variety of vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds,iShares®exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and other
exchange-traded products (together with ETFs, “ETPs”), collective investment funds and separate accounts. We also offer ourBlackRock Solutions®(“BRS”) risk
management and advisory services primarily to institutional investors.

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder
and over two-thirds of its Board of Directors consisting of independent directors. At December 31, 2013, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 20.9% of BlackRock’s voting common stock and 21.9% of BlackRock’s
capital stock, which includes outstanding common stock and nonvoting preferred stock.

Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by,
among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:



•the Company’s diversified active and passive product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and
multi-asset investment solutions to address specific client needs;

•the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for passive products;



•the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services;



•the Company’s positioning in the face of macro challenges driving trends in investor behavior, including the secular shift to passive investing and ETPs, a focus on income and retirement, and barbelling of risk
using passive and active products, including alternatives;



•the Company’s global presence and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 48% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients, and
approximately 44% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States; and



•the growing recognition of the global BlackRock brand, and the depth and breadth of the Company’s intellectual capital.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings
and stockholder returns in any given period.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability
to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to
deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term
success.

(1)Net of net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (“NCI”) (redeemable and nonredeemable).



(2)BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”); however, management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating
results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for
both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial
information prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP reported results include certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management deems nonrecurring, recurring infrequently or transactions that ultimately will not impact
BlackRock’s book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating as adjusted results.



See reconciliation to GAAP measures in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures, for further information on as adjusted
items for 2013, 2012 and 2011. Operating income, as adjusted, for 2009 excluded certain expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisition of Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”), as well as advisory fees, legal fees and
consulting transaction expenses related to the acquisition of BGI from Barclays on December 1, 2009 (the “BGI Transaction”), and restructuring charges. Operating income, as adjusted, for 2008 excluded restructuring charges. The
portion of compensation expense associated with certain long-term incentive plans (“LTIP”) funded or to be funded through share distributions to participants of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution
has also been excluded because these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. Compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded from
operating and nonoperating income, as adjusted, as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in nonoperating income (expense).



(3)



Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items listed above and also include the effect on deferred income tax
expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of income tax law changes and a state tax election.

(1)Amounts include acquisition adjustments and reclassification of certain AUM acquired from BGI in December 2009, Swiss Re Private Equity Partners (“SRPEP”) in September 2012, Claymore Investments, Inc.
(“Claymore”) in March 2012, Credit Suisse’s ETF franchise (“Credit Suisse ETF Transaction”) in July 2013, MGPA in October 2013 and other reclassifications to conform to current period combined AUM policy and presentation.
Amounts also include BGI merger-related outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to the third quarter of 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to the second quarter of 2011. As a result of client
investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction.



AUM represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment
management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include
assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of non-discretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or
return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending fees. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietaryAladdin®investment system as well as risk

management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions, number of
users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.At December 31, 2013, total AUM was $4.324 trillion, representing a CAGR of 27% over the
last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net new business and acquisitions, including BGI, which added approximately $1.844 trillion of AUM in December 2009, Claymore and
SRPEP, which added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012 and Credit Suisse and MGPA, which added $26.9 billion of AUM in 2013. These acquisitions significantly changed our AUM mix, from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2008 to a broadly
diversified product range, as described below.





The Company considers the categorization of its AUM
by client type, product type, investment style and client region useful to understanding its business. The following discussion of the Company’s AUM will be organized as follows:



Client TypeProduct TypeClient Region¨Retail¨Equity¨Americas¨iShares¨Fixed Income¨Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”)¨Institutional¨Multi-asset¨Asia-Pacific¨Alternatives¨Cash Management











CLIENT TYPEWe serve a
diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central
banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors; and retail investors.iSharesis presented
as a separate client type below, with investments iniSharesby institutions and retail clients excluded from figures and discussions in their respective sections below.

Our organizational structure was designed to ensure that strong investment performance is our highest priority, and that
we best align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends. Furthermore, our structure facilitates strong teamwork globally across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to
serve our clients and continue to develop our talent. Specifically, the client side of our business is organized into two groups: one comprising Retail andiSharesand another comprising Institutional andBlackRock Solutions. The
separation of the client functions into these two teams allows us to focus on the unique needs of these client groups by bringing the full capabilities of the firm to bear in an organized, cohesive approach. Additionally, our investments functions
are split into five distinct strategies: Alpha, Beta, Multi-Asset, Alternatives and Trading/Liquidity.

BlackRock serves retail investors globally through separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and
private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which
totaled $402.2 billion, or 82%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). The majority (94%) of long-term retail AUM is invested in active
products, although this is impacted by the fact thatiSharesis shown separately. Retail represented 12% oflong-termAUM at December 31, 2013 and 34% of long-term base fees for 2013.The client base is also diversified geographically, with 70% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 24% in EMEA and 6% in Asia-Pacific at
year-end 2013.•U.S. retaillong-term net inflows of $21.3 billion, or 7% organic growth, were driven by flows into income products, with investors’ continued attraction to yield in

a low rate environment, and a growing appreciation for duration risk. Multi-asset class products led flows with $10.0 billion of net inflows, driven by demand for our flagship Global Allocation
and Multi-Asset Income funds. Fixed income net inflows of $9.4 billion reflected growing interest in unconstrained fixed income, with our Strategic Income Opportunities fund raising $6.9 billion. Our suite of six retail alternatives mutual funds
continued to gain traction, raising $4.6 billion of net inflows, largely driven by our zero-duration liquid Global Long/Short Credit fund. This range of alternatives mutual funds now stands at $5.6 billion in AUM, and we are committed to broadening
the distribution of alternatives funds to bring institutional-quality alternatives products to retail investors. Net inflows across multi-asset class, fixed income and alternatives were partially offset by equity net outflows of $2.8 billion, driven
by historical performance-related redemptions from U.S. large cap equities, where we have implemented management changes to better meet our high performance standards. As of December 31, 2013, we are the leading U.S. manager by AUM of SMAs,













the second largest closed-end fund manager and a top-ten manager by AUM and 2013 net flows of long-term open-end mutual funds1. In 2013, we
were also the leading manager by net flows forlong-datedfixed income mutual funds1.•We have fully integrated our legacy retail andiSharesretail distribution teams to create a unified client-facing presence. As retail clients increasingly use BlackRock’s capabilities in combination —
active, alternative and passive — it is a strategic priority for BlackRock to coherently deliver these capabilities through one integrated team.

•International retaillong-term net inflows of $17.5 billion, representing 15% organic growth, were positive across major regions and diversified across asset classes. Equity net inflows of $6.4 billion
were driven by strong demand for our top-performing European Equities franchise as investor risk appetite for the sector improved. Multi-asset class and fixed income products each generated net inflows of $4.8 billion, as investors looked to manage
duration and volatility in their portfolios. In 2013, we were ranked as the third largest cross border fund provider2. In the United Kingdom, we ranked among the five largest fund managers2.

iSharesis the leading ETF provider in the world, with $914.4 billion of AUM at December 31, 2013, and
was the top asset gatherer globally in 20133with $64.0 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 8%. Equity net inflows of $74.1 billion were driven by flows into funds with broad
developed market exposures, partially offset by outflows from emerging markets products.iSharesfixed income experienced net outflows of $7.5 billion, as the continued low interest rate environment led many liquidity-oriented investors to
sell long-duration assets, which made up the majority of theiSharesfixed income suite. In 2013, we launched several funds to meet demand from clients seeking protection in a rising interest rate environment by offering an expanded product
set that includes four new U.S. funds, including short-duration versions of our flagship high yield and investment grade credit products, and short maturity and liquidity income funds.iSharesalternatives had $3.1 billion of net outflows
predominantly out of commodities.iSharesrepresented 23% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2013 and 35% of long-term base fees for 2013.

iSharesoffers the most diverse product set in the industry with 703 ETFs at year-end 2013, and serves the broadest client base, covering more than 25 countries on five continents. During 2013,iSharescontinued its dual commitment to innovation
and responsible product structuring by introducing 42 new ETFs, acquiring Credit Suisse’s 58 ETFs in Europe and entering into a critical new strategic alliance with Fidelity Investments to deliver Fidelity’s more than 10 million
clients increased access to

iSharesproducts, tools and support. Our alliance with Fidelity Investments and a successful full first year for the Core Series have deeply expanded our presence and offerings among
buy-and-hold investors. Our broad product range offers investors a precise, transparent and low-cost way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult or expensive for many
investors to access until now, as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently.•U.S. iSharesAUM ended at $655.6 billion with $41.4 billion of net inflows driven by strong demand for developed markets equities and short-duration fixed income. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we
debuted the Core Series in the United States, designed to provide the essential building blocks for buy-and-hold investors to use in constructing the core of their portfolio. The Core Series demonstrated solid results in its first full year, raising
$20.0 billion in net inflows, primarily in U.S. equities. In the United States,iSharesmaintained its position as the largest ETF provider, with 39% share of AUM3.•International iSharesAUM ended at $258.8 billion with robust net new business of $22.6 billion led by demand for European and Japanese equities, as well as a diverse range of fixed income products.

BlackRock’s institutional AUM is well diversified by both product and region, and we serve institutional investors
on six continents in sub-categories including: pensions, endowments and foundations, official institutions, and financial institutions, as described below.

Institutional activeAUM ended the quarter at $932.4 billion, up $47.7 billion, or 5%, since year-end 2012. Institutional active represented 23% of
long-term AUM and 21% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM reflected continued strength in multi-asset class products with net inflows of $29.0 billion largely from defined contribution plans into target date offerings. Multi-asset class net
inflows were offset by equity net outflows of $16.5 billion, with 70% of outflows coming from fundamental strategies, and fixed income net outflows of $3.6 billion, largely from U.S. intermediate duration mandates. Alternatives net outflows of
$9.8 billion were primarily due to active currency redemptions of $6.5 billion and return of capital on opportunistic funds of $2.5 billion.

Institutional
non-ETF indexAUM totaled $1.678 trillion at December 31, 2013, reflecting net inflows of $15.3 billion. Flows were led by fixed income with net inflows of $8.3 billion, primarily into local currency, U.S. targeted duration and
global bond mandates as clients rebalanced portfolios and captured gains in equity markets. Equities saw net inflows of $8.0 billion, primarily into global mandates, as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for broad macro exposure.
Institutional non-ETF index represented 42% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2013 and accounted for 10% of long-term base fees for 2013.

The Company’s
institutional clients consist of the following:



•Pensions, Foundations and Endowments.BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world with $1.718 trillion, or 66%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined
contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2013.

Retirement is a key theme as longevity, aging populations and changing demographics worldwide are driving investment decisions. The market landscape is shifting from defined benefit to defined
contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $30.0 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, or 7% organic growth. Defined contribution net inflows were led by $20.5 billion into multi-asset class products,
with ourLifePath®target-date suite serving as a key component of our retirement solutions. In 2013, ourLifePathfranchise raised $23.9 billion in net inflows, a 38% organic
growth rate. We ended 2013 with $526.4 billion in defined contribution AUM, and remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional
$59.9 billion, or 3% of long-term institutional AUM, was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.



•Official Institutions.We also managed $221.5 billion, or 8%, of long-term institutional AUM, for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and
government ministries and agencies at year-end 2013. This specialty client group grew with long-term net new business of $22.7 billion for the year, primarily into passive equity mandates. These clients often require specialized investment policy
advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.



•Financial and Other Institutions.BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $237.3 billion, or 9%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2013, and
contributed $5.7 billion of long-term net inflows. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $373.3 billion, or 14%, of
long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Long-term product offerings include active and passive strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns
in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to
drive portfolio construction. In contrast, passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities
selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Passive strategies include both our institutional non-ETF index products andiSharesETFs.

Although many clients use both active and passive strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain
exposure to a market or asset class. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in
institutional index products on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.

Equity

Year-end 2013 equity AUM of $2.318 trillion increased by $472.2 billion, or 26%, from the end of 2012, largely due to flows into U.S. and a range of international
equity mandates reflecting investors’ increased risk appetite and the effect of higher market valuations. Equity AUM growth included $69.3 billion in net new business and $13.0 billion in new

assets related to the Credit Suisse ETF acquisition in July 2013. Net new business of $69.3 billion was driven by net inflows of $74.1 billion and $10.5 billion intoiSharesand non-ETF
index accounts, respectively. Passive inflows were offset by active net outflows of $15.4 billion, with net outflows of $9.9 billion and $5.5 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products, respectively.

BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is tied to international markets, including
emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than similar U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which do not consistently move in tandem with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on
BlackRock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues.

Fixed Income

Fixed income AUM ended 2013 at $1.242 trillion, declining $17.1 billion, or 1%, relative to December 31, 2012. The decline in AUM reflected $29.1 billion in market
and foreign exchange losses, partially offset by $11.5 billion in net new business and $1.3 billion in new assets related to the Credit Suisse ETF acquisition. In 2013, net new business was led by strong flows into unconstrained fixed income
offerings, such as our Strategic Income Opportunities fund, which had net inflows of $6.9 billion during the year, despite overall industry outflows from U.S. bond funds. Fixed income net inflows of $14.8 billion and $8.5 billion into fundamental
and non-ETF index products, respectively, were partially offset by net outflows of $7.5 billion and $4.3 billion fromiSharesand model based strategies, respectively.













Multi-Asset Class

(1)Amounts include $6.0 billion of AUM reclassed from non-ETF index equity and fixed income to multi-asset.



BlackRock’s multi-asset class team manages a variety of balanced funds and bespoke mandates for a diversified client
base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities, currencies, bonds and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative
investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.Flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $27.1 billion, or 64%,
of net inflows coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows, and contributed $20.5 billion to institutional multi-asset class net new business in 2013, primarily
into target date and target risk product offerings. Retail net inflows of $14.8 billion were driven by particular demand for our Global Allocation suite, which saw $6.3 billion of net inflows, and our Multi-Asset Income fund which raised $4.1
billion in 2013.The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:•Asset allocation and balanced productsrepresented 50% of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, with growth in AUM driven by net new business of $15.9 billion. These strategies combine equity, fixed income
and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to

minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset
Income suites.•Target date and target risk productsgrew 37% organically in 2013. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans accounting for over 80% of
AUM. The remaining 10% of target date and target risk AUM consisted of retail client investments. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in ourLifePathandLifePath Retirement Income®offerings, and included $10.4 billion of assets related to two largeLifePathopen-architecture assignments where we provide customized asset allocation glidepaths, direct asset
management and model the use of third-party managers.LifePathproducts utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing.•Fiduciary management servicesare complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These
customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.

(1)Amounts represent AUM acquired in the Credit Suisse ETF acquisition in July 2013 and AUM acquired in the MGPA acquisition in October 2013.



The BlackRock Alternative Investors (“BAI”) group coordinates our alternative investment efforts, including
product management, business development and client service. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories — core and currency and commodities. Core includes hedge funds, funds of funds (hedge funds and private equity), real estate
and hard asset offerings. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.

We continued to make significant investments in our alternatives platform as demonstrated by our acquisition of MGPA,
which doubled the size of our real estate investment advisory platform in addition to extending our real estate debt and equity investment capabilities to Asia-Pacific and Europe, and the build out of our alternatives retail platform, which now
stands at $16.2 billion in AUM. We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt













their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives, they will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings, and as a top 10
alternative provider4our highly diversified $111.1 billion alternatives franchise is well positioned to meet growing demand from both institutional and retail investors.

Core.



•Hedge Fundsnet inflows of $4.4 billion were led by net inflows of $5.9 billion into single-strategy hedge funds. Single-strategy net inflows were driven by net inflows of $4.6 billion into retail alternative
mutual funds, paced by our zero-duration liquid Global Long/Short Credit fund. Single-strategy net inflows were offset by return of capital of $2.5 billion on opportunistic funds, largely due to a partial liquidation of an opportunistic 2007 vintage
closed-end mortgage fund. Hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single-strategy, multi-strategy, and global macro, as well as portable alpha, distressed and opportunistic offerings. Products include both open-end hedge funds and similar products, and
closed-end funds created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term investment horizon.



•Funds of FundsAUM included $16.9 billion in funds of hedge funds and hybrid vehicles and $11.9 billion in private equity funds of funds. Net outflows of $1.4 billion were predominantly from funds of hedge funds.



•Real Estate and Hard AssetsAUM grew 90% compared to year-end 2012, primarily due to $11.0 billion in new assets from the acquisition of MGPA. Offerings include high yield debt and core, value-added and
opportunistic equity portfolios and renewable power funds. We continued to grow our real estate platform and product offerings with the acquisition of MGPA.



During 2013, we secured $6 billion of alternatives commitments in offerings including infrastructure, strategic credit
and funds of funds. The majority of these commitments are unfunded and are expected to be deployed in future quarters.

Currency and Commodities.AUM
in currency and commodities declined 37% compared to year-end 2012, reflecting net outflows of $8.7 billion, primarily from low fee active currency mandates. Currency and commodities products include a range of active and passive products. OuriSharescommodities products represented $16.1 billion of AUM, including $1.6 billion acquired from Credit Suisse, and are not eligible for performance fees.

Cash Management

Cash management AUM totaled $275.6 billion at
December 31, 2013, of which $114.7 billion was in prime strategies, up $11.8 billion, or 4%, from year-end 2012. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios are
denominated in U.S. dollar, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Euro or British pound. We generated net inflows of $10.1 billion during 2013, and continue to face headwinds around the uncertainty of future regulatory changes and a near zero interest
rate environment. We provided new solutions and choices for our clients by launching ultra-short duration products in the United States, which address the immediate challenge of a continuing low interest rate environment as well as provide valuable
investment alternatives in the wake of money market fund regulatory change. In Europe, we launched a non-rated Euro liquidity fund. Further, some existing products were re-structured with features to address negative yields, should they occur.

Our footprint in each of these regions reflects strong relationships with intermediaries and an established ability to
deliver our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.

Americas.Net new business in
long-term products of $72.1 billion was driven by equity and multi-asset class net inflows of $53.3 billion and $36.1 billion, respectively, which were partially offset by fixed income and alternatives net outflows of $13.0 billion and $4.3
billion, respectively. During the year, we served clients through offices in 33 states in the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Spain.

EMEA.During the year, clients awarded us long-term net new business of $41.3 billion, including inflows from investors in 22 countries across the region.
EMEA net new business was led by equity net inflows of $20.1 billion as clients began to re-risk in the face of improving confidence in European markets. Our offerings include fund families in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and
Dublin andiShareslisted on stock exchanges throughout Europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.

Asia-Pacific.Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, and joint ventures in China and India. Long-term net new business of $3.8 billion was led by fixed income and
multi-asset class net inflows of $8.7 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, partially offset by equity and alternatives net outflows of $4.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

BLACKROCK SOLUTIONS

BlackRock Solutionsoffers investment
management technology systems, risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis.Aladdinis our proprietary technology platform, which serves as the risk management system for both BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated
institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via the Green Package®and risk management advisory services; interactive fixed income
analytics through our web-based calculator, AnSer®; middle and back office outsourcing services; and investment accounting. BRS’ Financial Markets Advisory (“FMA”) group
provides services such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies, for a wide range of global clients.

BlackRock Solutionsrecord revenues of $577 million were up 11% year over year. OurAladdinbusiness, which represented 73% of BRS revenue for the year,
signed more than 15 new clients in 2013, and continues to benefit from trends favoring global investment platform consolidation and multi-asset risk solutions.Aladdinbusiness assignments are typically long-term contracts that provide
significant recurring revenue.

Our FMA group signed more than 50 new assignments during the year and continued to post strong revenues, even as the business
transitions from a “crisis management” emphasis to a more institutionalized advisory business model, with a strong focus on helping clients navigate and implement requirements for the new regulatory environment. Advisory AUM decreased 20%
to $36.3 billion, driven by $7.4 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted levels.

At year-end, BRS served clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across
North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.













SECURITIES LENDING

Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. The cash management team
invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings and/or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The
value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $156 billion, up from $134 billion at year-end 2012. Liability spreads declined from elevated 2012 levels, as
the proportion of “special collateral,” securities commanding premium lending fees, declined due to low idiosyncratic risk, low single stock volatility and lack of M&A activity.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management.
Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and
maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal
risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation/reporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant
portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio
managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.

RISK & QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock
draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies
and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with
portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.

COMPETITION

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer
products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must

be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, investment style and
discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and
the quality of its client service. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new business will be
successful.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

REGULATION

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject
to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United













States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment
companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers, and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers,
investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on business if it fails to comply with
such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser
and other registrations, censures and fines both for individuals and the Company. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion
below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.

REGULATORY REFORM

include those concerning, among other things, the registration and regulation of commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisors (and the accompanying registration and regulation of such
entities by the National Futures Association (the “NFA”)), the registration status of dealer counterparties and other counterparties who are major participants in the swap markets, and requirements concerning mandatory clearing of certain
swap transactions. Jurisdictions outside the United States in which BlackRock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could have a similar
impact on BlackRock and the broader markets.













regulations were issued by the IRS on January 17, 2013, with the earliest effective dates beginning on July 1, 2014. In many instances, however, the precise nature of what needs to be
implemented will be governed by bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (“IGAs”) between the United States and the countries in which BlackRock does business. While many of these IGAs have been put into place, others have yet to be
concluded. FATCA could cause the Company to incur significant administrative and compliance costs and subject clients to U.S. tax withholding.

An example of
changes in the regulatory landscape in Europe is the European Union (“EU”) Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), which became effective on July 21, 2011 and was required to be implemented by EU member
states by July 22, 2013. The AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also
regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). In general, the AIFMD will have a staged implementation between mid-2013 and 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements will restrict AIF marketing
and will place additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management.

Globally, regulators are examining the potential risks in ETFs and may impose additional regulations on ETFs, including requirements to promote increased transparency
and to limit the ability of ETFs to utilize derivatives. The International Organization of Securities Commissions published principles for regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks in 2013, with standards applying to methodologies for benchmark
calculation, and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process; some national and regional regulators are currently reviewing how to apply these principles, with a draft European Regulation published in September 2013. Any of these
regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and/or on behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the
activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors.

Additional
legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock.
BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust
regulation and electronic commerce. See the “— Non-U.S. Regulation” section below for a further discussion of regulatory reforms being considered and/or adopted outside of the United States.

U.S. REGULATION

BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are subject
to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”),

the NFA, the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money
laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers
Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company
Act imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and
impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and
regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.

BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well
as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits,
volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Depending on the scope of the rules to be adopted by the SEC, provisions added to the Exchange Act by the DFA may require certain BlackRock
subsidiaries to register as municipal advisors in relation to their services for state and local governments, pension plans and other investment programs, such as college savings plans. In addition, BlackRock manages a variety of investment funds
listed on U.S. and non-U.S. exchanges, which are subject to the rules of such exchanges. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Company’s activities and damage its reputation.

BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, CDOs, real estate funds, collective
investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to
private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other
matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the
DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are













fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and
disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit
plan clients.

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC
and are members of the NFA. Additional BlackRock entities may need to register as a CPO or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the CFTC. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system
covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”) and
BlackRock Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also
an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) subject to MSRB rules.

U.S. BANKING REGULATION

PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a
“financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As described in “Item 1-Business”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on
the Federal Reserve’s current interpretation of the BHC Act, this ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a non-bank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act and therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the
Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its
banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. PNC’s
relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of BlackRock’s business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.

BTC is a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC
is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and
regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s
customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s stockholders.

BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company under the BHC Act.
Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in
investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve,
deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of PNC to extend credit to
or conduct other transactions with BlackRock or its funds. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of
BlackRock’s businesses.

The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any
activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRock’s business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of
applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s non-bank affiliates, such as BlackRock.

Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a
change of status could be caused by any failure of PNC or one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure
of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act.

NON-U.S. REGULATION

BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies and, in certain
cases, are affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. As BlackRock continues to expand its international presence, a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory
frameworks comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.

The Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”) currently regulates certain
BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, and branches of its U.K. regulated entities in the EU, and the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) also regulates one BlackRock subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the
FCA and/or the PRA is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA’s rules made under that Act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements,
senior management arrangements,













conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements imposed on firms. The FCA supervises the
Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews — in order to monitor the Company’s compliance with regulatory requirements.
Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.

In
addition to the above, the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
(“MiFID”), which became effective on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA, as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital
requirements. Revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms apply as of January 1, 2014. These include requirements not only on capital, but address matters of governance and remuneration as well. These will
have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade
transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.

The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into national
legislation and FCA regulations, as have those other European jurisdictions in which BlackRock has a presence (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU or EEA). A review of MiFID by the European Commission has led to the publication of a
draft amended Directive and a draft new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. The proposals, which are currently being finalized, are likely to result in changes to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of
instruments subject to these requirements. They may affect the buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading. The proposals may also result in
changes to conduct of business requirements including selling practices, intermediary inducements and client categorization. The proposals also envisage giving the European Commission power to ban certain products and services. A further EU
regulation, Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, was adopted in August 2012, and requires (i) the central clearing of
standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative contracts from February 2014.

In addition, the FCA will introduce rules in April 2014 that ban payments by product providers to distribution platforms for both advised and non-advised business.
These rules follow on from the retail distribution review that came into effect in December 2012 and changed how retail clients pay for investment advice. The FCA also has proposed a prohibition on the use of dealing commissions to pay for corporate
access. Final rules are expected to be issued in mid-2014 along with a discussion paper on the broader use of dealing commissions.

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform,
outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the MiFID review (mentioned above) was a part. These, together with the changes contemplated by the AIFMD (mentioned above),
will have direct and indirect effects on BlackRock’s operations in the EEA.

The European Commission has also published proposals to replace the Market Abuse
Directive with a regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions. The Regulation has now been largely agreed, but an implementation date remains outstanding as it will be linked to the
commencement of the revised MiFID rules.

The next iteration of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive
(“UCITS IV”), was required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July 1, 2011. The United Kingdom has adopted UCITS IV requirements into national legislation and FCA regulation. Luxembourg and Ireland have
also adopted UCITS IV into their national legislation. However, several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. UCITS IV introduced new requirements including a requirement on UCITS funds to provide a key investor
information document. Recent European Commission consultations have addressed retail investor protection issues, including UCITS V, which considers, among other items, custodial liability, and UCITS VI, which includes proposals on depositaries and
product management. A separate proposed regulation on money market funds has also been published and would, if adopted, have a significant impact on BlackRock’s European money market fund offerings.

Proposals on packaged retail investment products (“PRIPs”) are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs),
revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directive’s selling standard (for all insurance-based PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all PRIPs though a separate EU legislative process.

The European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) has published guidelines on ETFs and other UCITS issues in February 2013, which introduce new
collateral management requirements for UCITS concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives using Efficient Portfolio Management techniques and OTC derivative transactions. These rules will require significant changes and
implementation is due by February 2014.

Certain individual EU Member States, such as France and Italy, have enacted national financial transaction taxes
(“FTTs”), and a group of Member States also could adopt a FTT under an EU Enhanced Cooperation procedure that would apply in those Member States. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would likely have a negative
impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. A FTT could
significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into, on behalf of our clients, securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to a FTT, which would adversely impact our revenues.

For the insurance sector, the Solvency II process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set













aside and will have an indirect effect on fund managers with insurance clients. The Solvency II process has been delayed from an original compliance date of January 1, 2014 but agreement has
now been confirmed for implementation on January 1, 2016.

In addition to the FCA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and
representative offices are overseen by financial services regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these
jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net
capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in Japan, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment
Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection
requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted
under the FIEL.

In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the
Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure to comply with applicable law and
regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.

The activities of certain BlackRock
subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of
intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock
subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with
the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.

There
are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business. Among the various international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the
extensive and increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.
