Overview

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK; “BlackRock” or the “Company”) is the world’s largest publicly traded investment management firm with employees
in 30 countries that serve clients in over 100 countries across the globe. We provide a broad range of investment and risk management services and had $3.792 trillion of assets under management (“AUM”) at December 31, 2012. Our
clients include retail, high net worth (“HNW”) and institutional investors, comprised of pension funds, official institutions, endowments, insurance companies, corporations, financial institutions, central banks and sovereign wealth funds.
The Company is highly regulated and serves its clients as a fiduciary. We do not engage in proprietary trading activities that could conflict with the interests of our clients.

Our unique platform enables us to offer active (alpha) investments with index (beta) products and risk management to develop tailored
solutions for clients. Our product range includes single- and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and/or money market instruments. We offer our products directly and through intermediaries in a variety of
vehicles, including open-end and closed-end mutual funds,iShares®exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and other exchange-traded products (together with ETFs,
“ETPs”), collective investment funds and separate accounts. We also offer our BlackRock Solutions®(“BRS”) investment systems, risk management and
advisory services primarily to institutional investors.

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and a
majority of independent directors on its Board of Directors. At December 31, 2012, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) owned approximately 20.8% of BlackRock’s voting common shares outstanding and approximately 21.9%
of total capital stock.

Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the following
factors:



•the Company’s diversified alpha and beta product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products
across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi-asset class investment solutions to address specific client needs;

•the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for passive products;



•the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services;



•the Company’s positioning in the face of macro challenges driving trends in investor behavior, including the secular shift to passive investing and ETPs, a
focus on income and retirement, and barbelling of risk using passive and high alpha products including alternatives;



•the Company’s global presence and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 45% of employees outside the United States supporting
local investment capabilities and serving clients, and approximately 44% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States; and



•the growing recognition of the global BlackRock brand, and the depth and breadth of the Company’s intellectual capital.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect
earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is
predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk
preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the
Company’s long-term success.

(1)Net of net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests.

(2)BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”); however,
management believes evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced if investors have additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations and, for the
reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such non-GAAP financial
measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. GAAP reported results include certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions
that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value and, therefore, are excluded in calculating as adjusted results as described below.





(3)Operating income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch
costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s
results until future periods. Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because
such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. In addition, in 2008 and 2007, revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excluded reimbursable property management compensation, which represented
compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to a third party, these employees were retained
on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted,
because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock.



Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted exclude the after-tax impact of the items listed above and also
include the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of income tax law changes and a state tax election.

due to manager concentration considerations prior to third quarter 2011 and outflows from scientific active equity performance prior to second quarter 2011. As a result of client investment manager concentration limits and the scientific active
equity performance, outflows were expected to occur for a period of time subsequent to the close of the transaction.

AUM represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to
investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not
include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of non-discretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may
earn securities lending fees. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietaryAladdin®investment system as well

as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be based on several criteria including value of positions,
number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.At December 31, 2012, total AUM was $3.792 trillion, representing a
compounded annual growth rate of 23% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net new business and acquisitions, including BGI, which added approximately $1.844
trillion of AUM in December 2009 and Claymore and SRPEP, which added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012. These acquisitions significantly changed our AUM mix, from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2007 to a broadly diversified product
range, as described below.

At year-end 2012, products invested primarily in long-term assets represented 92% of total AUM, or $3.482 trillion,
of which 53% were equity mandates, 36% fixed income accounts, 8% multi-asset class portfolios and 3% alternative investments. The remaining AUM was in cash management products and advisory mandates representing long-term portfolio liquidation
assignments. Net new business in long-term products totaled $107.7 billion excluding the effect of two large, low-fee non-ETP index fixed income outflows from two institutional clients of $36.0 billion in the first quarter of 2012 and $74.2 billion
in the third quarter of 2012. Net inflows in long-term products, excluding these outflows, were augmented by net inflows into cash management products. Long-term and cash product net inflows were offset by advisory distributions due to the
successful completion of asset dispositions related to the three Maiden Lane vehicles associated with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,

marking the repayment of all senior and junior obligations of the three vehicles and the generation of net gains benefiting the U.S. public.Long-term product offerings include active and passive (index) strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or
performance hurdle (alpha) while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio
construction. In contrast, passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index (beta), generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to
approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Passive strategies include both our institutional non-ETP index products andiSharesETPs.









Although many clients use both active and passive strategies, the application of these strategies differs greatly.
For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager. This has the effect of increasing turnover of index AUM. In addition, institutional non-ETP index assignments tend to
be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.

Equity

Year-end 2012 equity AUM of $1.845 trillion
increased by $285.4 billion, or 18%, from the end of 2011, largely due to flows into regional, country-specific and global mandates and the effect of higher market valuations. Equity AUM growth included $54.0 billion in net new business and $3.6
billion in new assets related to the acquisition of Claymore. Net new business of $54.0 billion was driven by net inflows of $53.0 billion and $19.1 billion intoiSharesand non-ETP index accounts, respectively. Passive inflows were offset by
active net outflows of $18.1 billion, with net outflows of $10.0 billion and $8.1 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products, respectively.

Passive strategies represented 84% of equity AUM with the remaining 16% in active mandates. Institutional investors represented 62% of equity AUM, whileiShares,and retail and HNW represented 29% and 9%,
respectively. At year-end 2012, 63% of equity AUM was managed for clients in the Americas (defined as the United States, Caribbean, Canada, Latin America and Iberia) compared with 28% and 9% managed for clients in EMEA and Asia-Pacific,
respectively.

BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s
equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than similar U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which do not consistently move in tandem
with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on BlackRock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues.Fixed IncomeFixed income AUM ended 2012 at $1.259 trillion, rising $11.6 billion, or 1%, relative to December 31, 2011. Growth in AUM reflected $43.3 billion in net new
business, excluding the two large previously mentioned low-fee outflows, $75.4 billion in market and foreign exchange gains and $3.0 billion in new assets related to Claymore. Net new business was led by flows into domestic specialty and global bond
mandates, with net inflows of $28.8 billion, $13.6 billion and $3.1 billion intoiShares, non-ETP index and model-based products, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $2.2 billion from fundamental strategies.Fixed Income AUM was split between passive and active strategies with 48% and 52%, respectively. Institutional investors represented 74% of fixed income AUM whileiSharesand retail and HNW represented 15% and 11%, respectively. At year-end 2012, 59% of fixed income AUM was managed for clients in the Americas compared with 33% and 8% managed for clients in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively.

Multi-asset class AUM totaled $267.7 billion at year-end 2012, up 19%, or $42.6 billion, reflecting $15.8 billion in
net new business and $26.7 billion in portfolio valuation gains. BlackRock’s multi-asset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverages our broad investment expertise in global equities,
currencies, bonds and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only

portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.At
December 31, 2012, institutional investors represented 66% of multi-asset class AUM, while retail and HNW accounted for the remaining AUM. Additionally, 58% of multi-asset class AUM is managed for clients based in the Americas with 37% and 5%
managed for clients in EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively. Flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our advice in an increasingly









challenging investment environment with $15.0 billion, or 95%, of net inflows coming from institutional clients, with the remaining $0.8 billion, or 5%, generated by retail and HNW clients.
Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows. This client group added $13.1 billion of net new business in 2012. During the year, Americas net inflows of $18.5 billion were partially offset by net
outflows of $2.6 billion collectively from EMEA and Asia-Pacific clients.The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:•Asset allocation and balanced productsrepresented 52%, or $140.2 billion, of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, up $14.1 billion, with growth in
AUM driven by net new business of $1.6 billion and $12.4 billion in market and foreign exchange gains. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific
benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions.•Target date and target risk productsended the year at $69.9 billion, up $20.8 billion, or 42%, since December 31, 2011. Growth in AUM was
driven by

net new business of $14.5 billion, a year-over-year organic growth rate of 30%. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans
accounting for over 80% of AUM. The remaining 10% of target date and target risk AUM consisted of retail client investments. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in ourLifePathandLifePath Retirement Income®offerings, which are qualified investment options under the Pension Protection Act of 2006. These products utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to
balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected retirement timing.•Fiduciary management servicesaccounted for 22%, or $57.7 billion, of multi-asset AUM at December 31, 2012 and increased $7.7 billion during
the year due to market and foreign exchange gains. These are complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These customized services require strong partnership
with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.

Alternatives AUM totaled $109.8 billion at year-end 2012, up $4.8 billion, or 5%, reflecting $3.3 billion in
portfolio valuation gains and $7.0 billion in new assets related to the acquisitions of SRPEP, which deepened our alternatives footprint in the European and Asian markets, and Claymore. Core alternative outflows of $3.9 billion were driven almost
exclusively by return of capital to clients. Currency net outflows of $5.0 billion were partially offset by net inflows of $3.5 billion intoiSharescommodity funds.We continued to make significant investments in our alternatives platform as demonstrated by our acquisition of SRPEP, successful closes on the renewable power initiative and our build out of an alternatives retail
platform, which now stands at nearly $10.0 billion in AUM.

We believe that as alternatives become more conventional and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives, they will further increase their use of
alternative investments to complement core holdings.Institutional investors represented 69%, or $75.8 billion, of alternatives AUM with retail and HNW
investors comprising an additional 9%, or $9.7 billion, at year-end 2012.iSharescommodity products accounted for the remaining $24.3 billion, or 22%, of AUM at year-end. Alternative clients are geographically diversified with 56%, 26%, and
18% of clients located in the Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific, respectively.The BlackRock Alternative Investors (“BAI”) group coordinates
our alternative investment efforts, including









product management, business development and client service. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories – core, which includes hedge funds, funds of funds (hedge funds and
private equity) and real estate offerings, and currency and commodities. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.

Core.



•Hedge Fundsended the year with $26.6 billion in AUM, down $1.4 billion as net inflows into single-strategy hedge funds of $1.0 billion were more than
offset by return of capital on opportunistic funds. Market valuation gains contributed $1.1 billion to AUM growth. Hedge fund AUM includes a variety of single-strategy, multi-strategy, and global macro, as well as portable alpha, distressed and
opportunistic offerings. Products include both open-end hedge funds and similar products, and closed-end funds created to take advantage of specific opportunities over a defined, often longer-term investment horizon.



•Funds of FundsAUM increased $6.3 billion, or 28%, to $29.1 billion at December 31, 2012, including $17.1 billion in funds of hedge funds and hybrid
vehicles and $12.0 billion in private equity funds of funds. Growth largely reflected $6.2 billion of assets from SRPEP as we expanded our fund of funds product offerings and further engage in European and Asian markets.



•Real Estate and Hard AssetsAUM totaled $12.7 billion, down $0.1 billion, or 1%, reflecting $0.6 billion in client net redemptions and distributions and
$0.5 billion in portfolio valuation gains. Offerings include high yield debt and core, value-added and opportunistic equity portfolios and renewable power funds. We continued to expand our real estate platform and product offerings with the launch
of our first U.S. real estate investment trust (“REIT”) mutual fund and addition of an infrastructure debt team to further increase and diversify our offerings within global infrastructure investing.

Currency and Commodities.AUM in currency and commodities strategies totaled $41.4 billion at year-end
2012, flat from year-end 2011, reflecting net outflows of $1.5 billion, primarily from active currency and currency overlays, and $0.8 billion of market and foreign exchange gains. Claymore also contributed $0.9 billion of AUM. Currency and
commodities products include a range of active and passive products. OuriSharescommodities products represented $24.3 billion of AUM, including $0.7 billion acquired from Claymore, and are not eligible for performance fees.

Cash Management

Cash management AUM totaled $263.7 billion
at December 31, 2012, up $9.1 billion, or 4%, from year-end 2011. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts. Portfolios may be denominated in U.S. dollar, Euro or British pound.

At year-end 2012, 84% of cash AUM was managed for institutions and 16% for retail and HNW investors. The investor base was also predominantly in the
Americas, with 69% of AUM managed for investors in the Americas and 31% for clients in other regions, mostly EMEA-based. We generated net inflows of $5.0 billion during 2012, reflecting continued uncertainty around future regulatory changes and a
challenging investing environment. To meet investor needs, we sought to provide new solutions and choices for our clients by launching short duration products in the United States, which both immediately address the challenge of a continuing low
interest rate environment and will also be important investment options should regulatory changes occur. In the EMEA business, and in particular for our Euro product set, we have taken action to ensure that we can provide effective cash management
solutions in the face of a potentially negative yield environment by taking steps to launch new products and re-engineer our existing product set.

The ETP industry experienced a banner year as annual inflow records from 2008 were broken in the
United States, the Asia-Pacific region and on a global basis, propelled by exceptional growth in fixed income and emerging markets equity products1. The industry saw $260billion1of net new business, representing 17% in organic growth during 2012, with year-end AUM
totaling $1.902 trillion1.

The global growth of the ETP
market reflects both continued adoption and new product introduction with investor product preferences driven to varying degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the
corresponding targeted index), liquidity (bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. Fixed income and emerging markets were drivers of industry growth. Fixed income ETPs globally gathered a record $70 billion of net inflows,
$54 billion of which was U.S.-listed, led by investment grade and high yield demand as investors shunned the record low yields of government securities in favor of higher yielding products. Both developed and emerging markets equity ETPs saw strong
inflows in 2012 as central banks around the world continued to pump liquidity into the global economy via asset purchase programs and accommodative monetary policy to help spur economic growth. U.S. equity ETPs globally had inflows of $116 billion,
$82 billion of which was into U.S.-listed funds, and emerging markets equity ETPs globally had $55 billion of net inflows, $30 billion of which was into U.S.-listed funds.1

iSharesis the leading ETP provider in the world, with $752.7 billion of AUM at December 31, 2012, which increased
$159.4 billion, or 27%, since year-end 2011.iShareswas the top asset gatherer globally in 20121with $85.2 billion of net inflows for an organic growth rate of 14%,
with additional AUM growth of $66.9 billion due to market valuation improvements. During 2012,iSharesintroduced 85 new ETPs, acquired Claymore’s 35 ETPs in Canada and continued our dual commitment to innovation and responsible product
structuring. Our broad product range offers investors a precise, transparent and low-cost way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult or expensive for many investors to
access until now, as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently.

At year-end,iSharesAUM included $534.7 billion, or 71%, in equity offerings, $192.9 billion, or 26%, in fixed income ETPs and $25.2 billion, or 3%, in multi-asset class and alternative investments.iSharesequity AUM increased $115.0 billion, or 27%, from

resulting currency debasement with an additional $1.1 billion of market and foreign exchange valuation gains.

iSharesoffers the most diverse product set in the industry with 621 ETPs at year-end 2012 and serves the broadest client base, covering 27 countries on five continents including North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia.iShareswas the ETP leader in asset gathering in 2012 with four of the top ten products and the highest number of leading products as measured by total assets, with five
of the top ten1. Notwithstanding an increase in the number of ETP products offered in the industry,iSharescontinued to maintain the largest share of global AUM with
39% at December 31, 20121.



•U.S. iSharesAUM ended at $552.3 billion with $61.0 billion of net inflows driven by strong demand for our yield-oriented and equity dividend
products with our flagship emerging markets fund also attracting strong flows in 2012. In the United States, we re-gained the top position for 2012 ETP flows with more than 30% market share, and at year-end 2012,iShareswas the largest ETP
provider in the United States with 41% share of AUM1. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we debuted the core series in the United States, designed to provide the essential
building blocks for buy-and-hold investors to use in constructing the core of their portfolio. The core series demonstrated solid early results with four new and six rebranded products covering U.S. and international equities and U.S. fixed income.



•International iSharesAUM ended at $200.4 billion with robust net new business of $24.2 billion for the year, led by emerging markets equity and
corporate fixed income products. In Europe, we captured 80% and 71% of 2012 fixed income and equity net inflows, respectively. At year-end 2012,iShareswas the largest European provider with 38% of AUM and 55% of total 2012 industry inflows
in the European market1.

In addition,
we were the largest ETP manager in Latin America with over 85% of AUM at December 31, 20121. We continue to look for opportunities to further diversify product offerings
in key strategic focus areas including attractive, high-growth markets both organically and









through acquisitions as demonstrated by our acquisition of Claymore and our 2013 agreement with Credit Suisse to acquire their ETF business, the closing of which is subject to customary closing
conditions.

In general, we expect to maintain relatively stable pricing, so long as it is supported by performance and theiSharesvalue proposition, although we continually seek to achieve efficiencies and pass them on to our clients.

We serve a diverse mix of institutional and retail investors worldwide. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution
pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions,
corporations and third-party fund sponsors; and retail and HNW investors. We also serve both institutional and retail and HNW investors who acquireiShareson exchanges worldwide.iSharesis presented under “Products” above,

In 2012, we completed an internal reorganization of the firm, structuring ourselves to ensure that strong investment
performance is our highest priority, and better align with our clients’ needs to capitalize on broader industry trends. Specifically, we organized the client side of our business into two groups: one comprising Retail andiSharesand
another comprising Institutional andBlackRock Solutions. The separation of the client

functions into these two teams allows us to better focus on the unique needs of these client groups by bringing the full capabilities of the firm to bear in an organized, cohesive approach.
Additionally, we split our investments functions into five distinct strategies: Alpha, Beta, Multi-Asset, Alternatives and Trading/Liquidity. This new organizational structure allows us to enhance our focus on performance and client engagement.

Long-term assets managed for institutional investors totaled $2.326 trillion, or 61%, of total AUM at year-end 2012.
During the year, net outflows in long-term products totaled $99.2 billion, which includes two large low-fee non-ETP index fixed income outflows from two institutional clients totaling $110.2 billion. Excluding these outflows, long-term net new
business from institutional clients totaled $11.0 billion with investment performance, market appreciation and foreign exchange valuation gains contributing $237.9 billion to AUM growth.

BlackRock’s institutional AUM is well diversified by both product and region, with 49% of long-term AUM in equities, 40% in fixed income, 8% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternatives. We serve institutional
investors on six continents, with 52% of long-term AUM managed on behalf of investors in the Americas, 37% in EMEA and 11% in Asia-Pacific. Institutional AUM is further diversified by investment style and by sub-categories: pensions, endowments and
foundations, official institutions, and financial institutions, as described below.

The mix by investment style was 38% active and 62% passive
(excluding institutional investors iniShares). As noted earlier, non-ETP index accounts tend to be larger institutional mandates managed for relatively low fee rates and subject to higher turnover.

A discussion of the Company’s Institutional AUM is presented below:

Institutional activeAUM ended the quarter at $884.7 billion, up $53.4 billion, or 6%, since year-end 2011, earning base fees of $1.8 billion. Institutional active represented 25% of long-term firm
AUM and 23% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM included market and investment performance gains of $71.3 billion and continued strength in multi-asset class products with net inflows of $12.3 billion largely into defined contribution plans,
target date and asset allocation offerings. Multi-asset net inflows were offset by equity net outflows of $14.1 billion, which were split between active fundamental and scientific active equity, and fixed income net outflows of $15.1 billion,
reflecting outflows from U.S. core and local currency mandates. Core alternatives net outflows were $0.3 billion, excluding $3.9 billion of return of capital.

Institutional non-ETP indexAUM totaled $1.441 trillion at December 31, 2012, reflecting net outflows of $75.1 billion, which included two large low-fee fixed income outflows from two clients of
$36.0 billion and $74.2 billion. Excluding these outflows, net new business was $35.0 billion, with market and foreign exchange valuation gains contributing $166.6 billion to AUM growth. The shift to passive strategies has proven to be a significant
and long-term trend in the

industry. Flows were led by equities with net inflows of $20.5 billion with flows primarily into global mandates as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for macro exposure as
they modestly re-risked. In 2012, institutional non-ETP index equity AUM crossed the $1 trillion threshold. Excluding the two previously mentioned outflows, fixed income garnered net inflows of $13.6 billion, led by flows into U.S. sector specialty
and global bond mandates. While institutional non-ETP index represented 41% of long-term firm AUM, it accounted for 11% of long-term base fees.

The
Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:



•Pensions, Endowments and Foundations.BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world with $1.542 trillion, or 66%, of
long-term institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2012. Retirement is a key theme as longevity, aging populations and changing
demographics worldwide are driving investment decisions. The market landscape is shifting from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $28.4 billion of long-term net inflows for
the year, or 9% organic growth. Defined contribution net inflows were led by $13.1 billion into multi-asset class products, with ourLifePathtarget date suite serving as a key component of our retirement solutions. We ended 2012 with $404.9
billion in defined contribution AUM and remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $58.1 billion was managed for other tax-exempt
investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.



•Official Institutions.We also managed $171.2 billion, or 7%, of long-term institutional AUM, for official institutions, including central banks,
sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2012. This specialty client group flourished with long-term net new business of $24.5 billion for the year. These clients often require
specialized investment policy advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.



•Financial Institutions.BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $226.6 billion, or 10%, of
institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2012. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $328.2 billion, or 14%, of long-term
institutional AUM at year-end.









Retail and HNW Investors (Excluding Investments in iShares)

BlackRock serves retail and HNW investors globally through separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit
trusts and private investment funds. At December 31, 2012, long-term assets managed for retail and HNW investors totaled $403.5 billion, up 11%, or $40.1 billion, versus year-end 2011. During the year, net inflows of $11.6 billion in
long-term products were augmented by market valuation improvements of $28.3 billion.

Retail and HNW investors are served principally through
intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $322.4 billion, or 80%, of retail and HNW long-term AUM at year-end,
with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. The product mix is well diversified, with 41% of long-term AUM in equities, 34% in fixed income, 23% in multi-asset class and 2% in alternatives. The vast
majority (98%) of long-term AUM is invested in active products, although this is partially inflated by the fact thatiSharesis shown separately, since we do not identify all of the underlying investors.

The client base is also diversified geographically, with 74% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 19% in EMEA and 7% in Asia-Pacific at
year-end 2012.



•U.S. retail and HNWlong-term inflows of $9.8 billion were driven by strong demand for U.S. sector-specialty and municipal fixed income mutual fund
offerings and income-oriented equity. In 2012, we broadened the distribution of alternatives funds to bring higher alpha, institutional quality hedge fund products to retail investors as three mutual funds launched at the end of 2011 gained traction
and acceptance, raising close to $0.8 billion of assets. U.S. retail alternatives AUM crossed the $5.0 billion threshold in 2012. The year also included the launch of the BlackRock Municipal Target Term Trust (“BTT”) with $2.1 billion of
assets raised, making it the largest municipal fund ever launched and the

largest overall industry offering since 2007. We are the leading U.S. manager by AUM of separately managed accounts, the second largest closed-end fund manager and a top-ten manager of long-term
open-end mutual funds2.



•International retailnet inflows of $1.8 billion in 2012 were driven by fixed income net inflows of $5.2 billion. Investor demand remained
distinctly risk-off in 2012, largely driven by macro political and economic instability and continued trends toward de-risking. Equity net outflows of $2.9 billion were predominantly from sector-specific and regional and country-specific equity
strategies due to uncertainty in European markets. Our international retail and HNW offerings include our Luxembourg cross-border fund families, BlackRock Global Funds (“BGF”), BlackRock Strategic Funds with $83.1 billion and $2.4 billion
of AUM at year-end 2012, respectively, and a range of retail funds in the United Kingdom. BGF contained 67 funds registered in 35 jurisdictions at year-end 2012. Over 60% of the funds were rated by S&P. In 2012, we were ranked as the third
largest cross border fund provider3. In the United Kingdom, we ranked among the five largest fund
managers3, and are known for our innovative product offerings, especially within natural resources, European equity, Asian equity and equity income.

Global Clientele

footprint in each of these regions reflects strong relationships with intermediaries and an established ability to deliver our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.

Americas.At year-end 2012, assets managed on behalf of clients domiciled in the Americas totaled
$2.326 trillion, or 61%, of total AUM, up $203.0 billion, or 10%, since year-end 2011. Net new business in long-term products of $69.8 billion and in cash management of $1.9 billion was offset by planned advisory distributions of $72.4 billion,
primarily due to the successful completion of asset dispositions related to the Maiden Lane vehicles. Market valuation gains contributed an additional $195.7 billion to AUM growth. During the year, we served clients through offices in 30 states in
the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Spain.

EMEA.AUM for clients based in EMEA ended the year at
$1.158 trillion, or 31%, of total AUM, an increase of $131.3 billion from year-end 2011. During the year, clients awarded net new business of $9.0 billion, including inflows from investors in 22 countries across the region. In the first quarter
2012, flows were impacted by one $36.0 billion low-fee institutional index fixed income redemption from a single client relating to the client’s decision to insource. Excluding this redemption, EMEA net new business was $45.0 billion, led by
equity net inflows of $32.7 billion as clients slowly began to re-risk in the face of improving confidence in European markets. Our offerings include fund families in the United Kingdom, Luxembourg and Dublin andiShareslisted on stock
exchanges throughout Europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.

Asia-Pacific.Clients in the Asia-Pacific region
are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and Korea, and joint ventures in China and India. At December 31, 2012, we managed $306.8 billion of AUM for clients in the region, a decrease of 15%, or $55.4
billion, from year-end 2011. Net outflows of $80.3 billion included one large low-fee institutional index fixed income redemption. Market and investment performance were favorable with $24.9 billion of gains.

Performance Notes.Past performance is not indicative of future results. The performance information shown is based on preliminarily available data. The performance information for actively managed accounts reflects U.S. open-end and closed-end
mutual funds and similar EMEA-based products with respect to peer median comparisons, and actively managed institutional and HNW separate accounts and funds located globally with respect to benchmark comparisons, as determined using objectively
based internal parameters, using the most current verified information available as of December 31, 2012.

Accounts terminated prior to
December 31, 2012 are not included. In addition, accounts that have not been verified as of January 29, 2013 have not been included. If such terminated and other accounts had been included, the performance information may have differed
substantially from that shown. The performance information does not include funds or accounts that are not measured against a benchmark, any benchmark-based alternatives product, private equity products, CDOs, or liquidation accounts managed by
BlackRock’s FMA group. Comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance for U.S. retail, institutional and HNW separate accounts and EMEA institutional separate accounts and net-of-fee performance for EMEA based retail products. The
performance tracking information for institutional non-ETP index accounts is based on gross-of-fee performance









as of December 31, 2012, and includes all institutional accounts and alliSharesfunds globally using an index strategy. AUM information is based on AUM for each account or fund in
the asset class shown without adjustment for overlapping management of the same account or fund as of December 31, 2012. The information reported may differ slightly from that reported previously due to the increased number of accounts that
have been verified since the last performance disclosure. BlackRock considers these differences to be not material.

The source of performance
information and peer medians is BlackRock and is based in part on data from Lipper Inc. for U.S. funds and Morningstar, Inc. for non-U.S. funds. Fund performance reflects the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, but does not reflect sales
charges.

BlackRock Solutions

BlackRock Solutionsoffers investment management technology systems, risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis. At
December 31, 2012, approximately $13.7 trillion of positions were processed on ourAladdinproprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment system for both BlackRock and a growing number of sophisticated institutional
investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via theGreen Package®and risk management advisory services; interactive
fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator,AnSer®; middle and back office outsourcing services; and investment accounting. BRS’ Financial
Markets Advisory (“FMA”) group provides services such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet strategies, for a wide range
of global clients.

In the face of increasing regulatory scrutiny, clients have increased their focus on risk management and demand for BRS services
continues to be robust. During 2012, BRS added 43 net new assignments and ended the year with record revenues of $518 million. At year-end, BRS served 169 clients, including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset
managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

OurAladdinbusiness posted strong annual growth of
16%. In 2012, we added $3.5 trillion in new assets to theAladdinplatform with the addition of 16 clients and expansion of 10 existing client mandates. We now have 51Aladdinclients and $14 trillion of assets on the platform with the
average size of theAladdinclient growing substantially in the last year.Aladdinassignments are long-term contracts that provide significant levels of recurring revenue.

In FMA, the nature of assignments is shifting to longer-term advisory and risk monitoring engagements. Advisory AUM
decreased 62% to $45.5 billion, driven by $74.5 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted levels.

Securities Lending

Securities lending, which is offered as a potential source of incremental returns on
long-term portfolios, is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. The cash management team invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other
portfolios. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings and/or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the
corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately
$134 billion, up from $122 billion at year-end 2011. Spreads were approximately flat compared to 2011, as lending premiums increased and offset declining cash reinvestment spreads. The proportion of securities commanding premium lending fees grew
slowly through the year, and started 2012 above the 2011 average.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending
collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and superior client service through all market cycles. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash
Management Risk Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our
business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily
evaluation/reporting of the profile of the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio
manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.









Risk & Quantitative Analysis

Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and
proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and
operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to
facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and analytics.

Competition

BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to,
those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products,
investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and
analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new
business will be successful.

development,iShares, alternatives, institutional sales and Asia.

Regulation

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily
intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers, and
the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as BlackRock and its subsidiaries, have broad administrative
powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of
individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. The rules governing the regulation of financial institutions and
their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.









Regulatory Reform

in which BlackRock operates are also in the process of devising or considering more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could have a similar impact on
BlackRock and the broader markets.









financial institutions to report to the IRS information about financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers and imposes withholding, documentation and reporting requirements on foreign financial
institutions. Final regulations were issued by the IRS on January 17, 2013, with the earliest effective dates beginning in January 1, 2014. In many instances, however, the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be governed by
bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (“IGAs”) between the United States and the countries in which BlackRock does business. Many of these IGAs have yet to be concluded. FATCA could cause the Company to incur significant administrative
and compliance costs and subject clients to U.S. tax withholding.

An example of changes in the regulatory landscape in Europe is the European Union
(“EU”) Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), which became effective on July 21, 2011 and is required to be implemented by EU member states by July 22, 2013. The AIFMD regulates managers of, and
service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area
(the “EEA”). In general, the AIFMD is expected to have a staged implementation between mid-2013 and 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements may restrict AIF marketing and will place additional compliance and disclosure
obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management.

Globally, regulators are examining the potential risks in ETFs and may impose additional regulations on ETFs, including requirements to promote increased transparency and to limit the ability of ETFs to utilize
derivatives. The International Organization of Securities Commissions is also examining the appropriate level of regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks, whether standards should apply to methodologies for benchmark calculation, and
transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process. Any of these regulatory changes could also lead to business disruptions, could materially and adversely impact the value of assets in which BlackRock has invested directly and/or on
behalf of clients, and, to the extent the regulations strictly control the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses or distinguish itself from competitors.

Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing
laws and regulations may directly affect the method of operation

and profitability of BlackRock. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial
communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. See the “–Non-U.S. Regulation” section below for a further discussion of regulatory reforms being considered
and/or adopted outside of the United States.

U.S. Regulation

BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the NFA, the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money
laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by various agencies.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the
“Advisers Act”), imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The
Investment Company Act imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute
proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state
securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.

BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange
Act”), as well as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g.,
short sale limits, volume limitations, reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Depending on the scope of the rules to be adopted by the SEC, provisions added to the Exchange Act by the DFA may require
certain BlackRock subsidiaries to register as municipal advisors in relation to their services for state









and local governments, pension plans and other investment programs, such as college savings plans. In addition, BlackRock manages a variety of investment funds listed on U.S. and non-U.S.
exchanges, which are subject to the rules of such exchanges. Violation of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Company’s activities and damage its reputation.

BlackRock manages a variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, CDOs, real estate funds, collective investment trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid
funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with
respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities, record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely
affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by
the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain
transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or
dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members of the NFA. Additional BlackRock entities may need
to register as a CPO or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the CFTC. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other financial instruments,
including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Three of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”), BlackRock Capital Markets, LLC and BlackRock Execution Services, are
registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of

FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock
Exchange (“NYSE”) and a member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) subject to MSRB rules.

U.S. Banking
Regulation

PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). Based on PNC’s interests in and relationships with BlackRock, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of PNC and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal
Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking
subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. PNC’s
relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of BlackRock’s business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.

BTC is a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly,
BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws
and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of
BTC’s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s stockholders.

BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that
are authorized for a “financial holding company” under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those
BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws. BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and
regulatory









interpretations. The Federal Reserve has broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or
assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock or its funds. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by
various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and growth of BlackRock’s businesses.

The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes
an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRock’s business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal
Reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s non-bank affiliates, such as BlackRock.

Any failure of PNC to
maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain
“well capitalized,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the DFA
broadened the requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by also requiring the holding company to remain “well capitalized” and “well managed.”

Non-U.S. Regulation

BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of
non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies and, in certain cases, are affected by U.S. laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application. As BlackRock continues to expand its international presence, a number of its
subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory frameworks comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.

The Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”) currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA is
required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA’s rules made under that Act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management

arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and controls. The FSA also supervises the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries under a “close and
continuous” regime – which include regular visits and meetings with senior management and control functions – to monitor the Company’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FSA’s rules may result in a wide
range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. In April 2013, the FSA is expected to be replaced by Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. Pending formal implementation, the FSA
has introduced a shadow internal structure in anticipation of the creation of the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Bank of England has created an interim Financial Policy Committee.

In addition to the above, the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory
regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”), which became effective on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the EEA, as well as the Capital
Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade
transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.

The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into
national legislation and FSA regulations, as have those other European jurisdictions in which BlackRock has a presence (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU or EEA). A review of MiFID by the European Commission has led to the
publication of a draft amendment Directive and a draft new Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. The proposals, if implemented, are likely to result in changes to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of
instruments subject to these requirements. They may affect the buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading. The proposals may also result in
changes to conduct of business requirements including selling practices, intermediary inducements and client categorization. The proposals also envisage giving the European Commission power to ban certain products and services. A further European
Commission Regulation, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”), was adopted in August 2012, and requires the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives and the mandatory reporting of all derivative contracts. Some of
the EMIR technical standards have recently been finalized and the remainder are expected to be finalized in 2013.









In addition, the FSA has finalized rules relating to its retail distribution review. These rules, which came into
effect on December 31, 2012, have changed how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products, including open-end and closed-end funds, structured products and insurance-based savings products. The
FSA is also considering further rules that would ban payments by product providers to distribution platforms for both advised and non-advised business.

In the aftermath of the financial crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be
reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the MiFID review (mentioned above) was a part. These, together with the changes contemplated by the AIFMD (mentioned above), will have direct and indirect effects on
BlackRock’s operations in the EEA.

The European Commission has also published proposals to replace the Market Abuse Directive with a regulation on
insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions. There are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject, including in relation to regulatory capital and the
protection of client assets, which will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.

The next iteration of the Undertakings
for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (“UCITS IV”), was required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July 1, 2011. The United Kingdom has adopted UCITS IV requirements into national
legislation and FSA regulation. Luxembourg and Ireland have also adopted UCITS IV into their national legislation. However, several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. UCITS IV introduced new requirements
including a requirement on UCITS funds to provide a key investor information document. There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection, including UCITS V, which addresses, among
other items, custodial liability, and UCITS VI, which includes proposals on depositaries, money market funds and product management.

Proposals on
packaged retail investment products (“PRIPs”) are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs), revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directive’s selling standard (for all insurance-based
PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all PRIPs though a separate EU legislative process.

Certain individual EU Member States, such as France and Italy, have enacted national financial transaction taxes
(“FTTs”), and a group of Member States also could adopt an FTT under an EU Enhanced Cooperation procedure that would apply only in those Member States. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would likely have a
negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. An FTT
could significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into, on behalf of our clients, securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an FTT, which would adversely impact our revenues.

For the insurance sector the Solvency II process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set aside and will have an indirect effect on fund
managers with insurance clients. The Solvency II process has been delayed from an original compliance date of January 1, 2014; no new timetable has been currently proposed.

In addition to the FSA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are overseen by financial services regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg,
Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, South Africa, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel
required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in Japan, Australia, China,
Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject
to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”),
which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result
in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.









In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain
subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (“APRA”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is
responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. APRA is the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry and oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, general insurance and reinsurance companies,
life insurance, friendly societies and most members of the superannuation (pension) industry. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in
Australia.

The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”)
which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the
“SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO
are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the
suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.

There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many other non-U.S.
jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business.
