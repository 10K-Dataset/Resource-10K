across the globe. Clients include tax-exempt institutions, such as defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans, charities, foundations and endowments; official institutions, such as central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals
and other government entities; taxable institutions, including insurance companies, financial institutions, corporations and third-party fund sponsors, and retail investors.

BlackRock maintains a significant global sales and marketing presence that is focused on establishing and maintaining retail and institutional investment management
relationships by marketing its services to investors directly and through financial professionals and pension consultants, and establishing third-party distribution relationships.

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and over two-thirds of its Board of Directors consisting of independent
directors. At December 31, 2014, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) held 21.0% of BlackRock’s voting common stock and 22.0% of BlackRock’s capital stock, which includes outstanding common stock and nonvoting

Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by, among other things, capitalizing on the
following factors:



•the Company’s focus on strong performance providing alpha for active products and limited or no tracking error for index products;



•the Company’s global reach and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 48% of employees outside the United States supporting local investment capabilities and serving clients, and
approximately 43% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;



•the Company’s diversified active and index product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and
multi-asset investment solutions to address specific client needs;



•the Company’s differentiated client relationships and fiduciary focus, which enable effective positioning toward changing client needs and macro trends including the secular shift to passive investing and ETFs, a
focus on income and retirement, and barbelling of risk using index and active products, including alternatives; and



•the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty, factors that can significantly affect earnings
and stockholder returns in any given period.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue, earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability
to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to
deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term
success.

AUM represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis pursuant to investment
management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported AUM does not include
assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of nondiscretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis.Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of AUM. We also earn performance fees on certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or
return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending fees. In addition, BlackRock offers its

proprietaryAladdininvestment system as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be based
on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.At December 31, 2014, total
AUM was $4.652 trillion, representing a CAGR of 7% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net new business and acquisitions, including Claymore and SRPEP, which
added $13.7 billion of AUM in 2012, and Credit Suisse and MGPA, which collectively added $26.9 billion of AUM in 2013. Our AUM mix encompasses a broadly diversified product range, as described below.

Retail



BlackRock serves retail investors globally through a wide array of vehicles across the active and passive spectrum,
including separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds, unit trusts and private investment funds. Retail investors are served principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and
independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $440.2

billion, or 82%, of retail long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts (“SMAs”). The majority (93%) of
long-term retail AUM is invested in active products, although this is impacted byiSharesbeing shown separately. Retail represented 12% of long-term AUM at December 31, 2014 and 35% of long-term base fees for 2014.

Institutional activeAUM ended 2014 at $959.2 billion, up $26.8 billion, or 3%, since year-end 2013.
Institutional active represented 22% of long-term AUM and 20% of long-term base fees. Growth in AUM reflected continued strength in multi-asset class products with net inflows of $15.8 billion largely from defined contribution plans into target date
offerings. Multi-asset class net inflows were offset by equity net outflows of $18.6 billion, with 63% of outflows coming from fundamental strategies. Fixed income net outflows of $6.9 billion were primarily due to several large client-specific
asset allocation decisions and corporate actions such as client acquisitions. These events offset positive momentum in credit mandates. Alternatives net outflows of $0.7 billion included $3.1 billion of return of capital; excluding return of
capital, alternatives net inflows of $2.4 billion were led by inflows into hedge fund and private equity solutions.

Institutional indexAUM totaled
$1.816 trillion at December 31, 2014, reflecting net inflows of $36.1 billion. Flows were led by fixed income with net inflows of $26.3 billion, primarily into local currency, U.S. targeted duration and global bond mandates, reflecting
solutions-based LDI activity and portfolio rebalancing. Equities saw net inflows of $9.9 billion, primarily into global mandates, as clients increasingly looked to use passive vehicles for broad macro exposure. Institutional index represented 42% of
long-term AUM at December 31, 2014 and accounted for 10% of long-term base fees for 2014.

The Company’s institutional clients consist of the following:



•Pensions, Foundations and Endowments.BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world with $1.877 trillion, or 68%, of long-term

institutional AUM managed for defined benefit, defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2014. The market landscape is shifting
from defined benefit to defined contribution, driving strong flows in our defined contribution channel, which had $29.3 billion of long-term net inflows for the year, or 6% organic growth, driven by continued demand for ourLifePath®target-date suite. We ended 2014 with $599.2 billion in defined contribution AUM, and remain well positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market
and demand for outcome-oriented investments. An additional $55.6 billion, or 2% of long-term institutional AUM, was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and endowments.



•Official Institutions.We also managed $228.8 billion, or 8%, of long-term institutional AUM for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds, supranationals, multilateral entities and
government ministries and agencies at year-end 2014. These clients often require specialized investment advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.



•Financial and Other Institutions.BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $233.7 billion, or 8%, of institutional long-term AUM at year-end 2014. Assets
managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $379.9 billion, or 14%, of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Long-term product offerings include active and index strategies. Our active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in
excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to
drive portfolio construction. In contrast, index strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index, generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities
selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index. Index strategies include both our non-ETF index products andiSharesETFs.

Although
many clients use both active and index strategies, the application of these strategies may differ. For example, clients may use index products to gain exposure to a market or asset class. In addition, institutional non-ETF index assignments tend to
be very large (multi-billion dollars) and typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index products on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.

Equity

Year-end 2014 equity AUM of $2.451 trillion increased by $133.4
billion, or 6%, from the end of 2013 due to net new business of $52.4 billion and net market appreciation and foreign exchange movements of $81.0 billion. Net inflows were driven by $59.6 billion and $17.7 billion intoiSharesand non-ETF
index accounts, respectively. Index inflows were offset by active net outflows of $24.9 billion, with outflows of $18.0 billion and $6.9 billion from fundamental and scientific active equity products, respectively.

BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately half of BlackRock’s equity AUM is

tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than similar U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets,
which do not consistently move in tandem with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on BlackRock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues.

Fixed Income

Fixed income AUM ended 2014 at $1.394 trillion, increasing $151.5 billion, or 12%, from December 31, 2013. The increase in AUM reflected $96.4 billion in
net new business and $55.1 billion in net market appreciation and foreign exchange movements. In 2014, net new business was diversified across fixed income offerings, with strong flows into our unconstrained, total return and high yield products.
Flagship funds in these product areas include our unconstrained Strategic Income Opportunities and Fixed Income Global Opportunities funds, with net inflows of $13.3 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively; our Total Return fund with net inflows of

Flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for our solutions-based advice with $15.1 billion, or 52%, of net inflows
coming from institutional clients. Defined contribution plans of institutional clients remained a significant driver of flows, and contributed $12.8 billion to institutional multi-asset class net new business in 2014, primarily into target date
and target risk product offerings. Retail net inflows of $13.4 billion were driven by particular demand for our Multi-Asset Income fund, which raised $6.3 billion in 2014.The Company’s multi-asset strategies include the following:•Asset allocation and balanced productsrepresented 48% of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, with growth in AUM driven by net new business of $18.4 billion. These strategies combine equity, fixed income
and alternative components for investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and
tactical asset allocation decisions. Flagship products in this category include our Global Allocation and Multi-Asset Income suites.

•Target date and target risk productsgrew 10% organically in 2014. Institutional investors represented 90% of target date and target risk AUM, with defined contribution plans accounting for over 80% of
AUM. The remaining 10% of target date and target risk AUM consisted of retail client investments. Flows were driven by defined contribution investments in ourLifePathandLifePath Retirement Income®offerings.LifePathproducts utilize a proprietary asset allocation model that seeks to balance risk and return over an investment horizon based on the investor’s expected
retirement timing.•Fiduciary management servicesare complex mandates in which pension plan sponsors or endowments and foundations retain BlackRock to assume responsibility for some or all aspects of plan management. These
customized services require strong partnership with the clients’ investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.













AlternativesBlackRock
Alternative Investors (“BAI”) focuses on sourcing and managing high-alpha investments with lower correlation to public markets and developing a holistic approach to address client needs in alternatives investing. Our alternatives products
fall into two main categories — core

and currency and commodities. Core includes hedge funds, hedge fund and private equity solutions (funds of funds), opportunistic private equity and credit, real estate and infrastructure
offerings. The products offered under the BAI umbrella are described below.

SECURITIES LENDING

Securities lending is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. The cash management team
invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a share of earnings and/or as a management fee based on a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The
value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $187 billion, up from $156 billion at year-end 2013. Liability spreads declined from 2013 levels, as the
proportion of “special collateral,” securities commanding premium lending fees, declined due to low idiosyncratic risk, low single stock volatility and lack of M&A activity.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality, liquidity and interest rate risk management.
Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Credit Committee has established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and
maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal
risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation/reporting of the profile of the portfolios













identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio
manager must obtain approval from the credit research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.

RISK & QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

Across all asset classes, in
addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to identify, measure and manage a
wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for firm wide investment
performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk models and
analytics.

COMPETITION

BlackRock competes with investment management
firms, mutual fund complexes, insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able
to compete effectively for AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for index products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the
Company has competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service.

GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION

At December 31, 2014, BlackRock served clients
in more than 100 countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. See Note 22,Segment Information, contained in Part II, Item 8 of this filing for more information.

EMPLOYEES

At December 31, 2014, BlackRock had a total of
approximately 12,200 employees, including approximately 5,800 located in offices outside the United States. Consistent with our commitment to continually expand and enhance our talent base to support our clients, we added approximately 800 employees
during the year, including in strategic focus areas.

REGULATION

Virtually all
aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations around the world, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered
and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their customers and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that
regulate investment advisers, investment funds and bank holding companies and other individuals and entities have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity or person from carrying on
business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time,
revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines both for individuals and the Company.

The rules governing the regulation of financial
institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.

GLOBAL REGULATORY REFORM

BlackRock is subject to numerous regulatory
reform initiatives around the world. Any such initiative, or any new laws or regulations or changes in enforcement of existing laws or regulations, could materially and adversely impact the scope or profitability of BlackRock’s business
activities, lead to business disruptions, require BlackRock to change certain business practices and expose BlackRock to additional costs (including compliance and legal costs), as well as reputational harm. BlackRock’s profitability also could
be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general, including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce.

Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act

In July 2010,
the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “DFA”) was signed into law in the United States. The DFA is expansive in scope and requires the adoption of extensive regulations and numerous regulatory decisions, many of
which have been adopted. As the impact of these rules will become evident over time, it is not yet possible to predict the ultimate effects that the DFA, or subsequent implementing regulations and decisions, will have upon BlackRock’s business,
financial condition, and results of operations.













Systemically Important Financial Institution Review

Under the DFA, BlackRock could be designated a systemically important financial institution (“SIFI”) and become subject to direct supervision by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). On July 31, 2014, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) principals directed the staff to undertake a more focused analysis of industry-wide products
and activities to assess potential risks associated with the asset management industry, and on December 18, 2014 the FSOC issued a Request for Information related to this analysis.

In addition, on January 8, 2014, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) issued
a consultative document on proposed methodologies to identify nonbank/noninsurance global systemically important financial institutions (“G-SIFI”). A second FSB-IOSCO consultation is expected to be released in the near future.

If BlackRock were designated a SIFI or G-SIFI, it could become subject to enhanced prudential, capital, supervisory and other requirements, such as risk-based capital
requirements, leverage limits, liquidity requirements, resolution plan and credit exposure report requirements, concentration limits, a contingent capital requirement, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits and overall risk management
requirements. Requirements such as these, which were designed to regulate banking institutions, would likely need to be modified to be applicable to an asset manager such as BlackRock. No proposals have been made indicating how such measures would
be adapted for asset managers.

Securities and Exchange Commission Review of Asset Managers

BlackRock’s business may also be impacted by Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulatory initiatives. For example, on December 11, 2014 the
Chair of the SEC announced that she is recommending that the SEC enhance its oversight of asset managers by (i) expanding and updating data requirements with which asset managers must comply, (ii) improving fund level controls, including
those related to liquidity levels and the nature of specific instruments and (iii) ensuring that asset management firms have appropriate transition plans in place to deal with market stress events or situations where an investment adviser is no
longer able to serve its clients. Although these recommendations have not yet resulted in any proposed rules, any additional SEC oversight or the introduction of any new reporting, disclosure or control requirements could expose BlackRock to
additional compliance costs and may require the Company to change how it operates its business.

Money Market Fund Reform

In July 2014, the SEC adopted rule amendments designed to reform the regulatory structure governing money market funds and to address the perceived systemic risks that
such funds present. The new rules require institutional prime and institutional municipal money market funds to employ a floating net asset value method of pricing, which allows the daily share prices of these funds to fluctuate along with changes
in the market-based value of fund assets. The rules also provide for new tools for the funds’ boards designed to address liquidity shocks, including liquidity fees and redemption gates. The rules do not apply to government

(non-municipal) and retail money market funds, except that retail money market funds must comply with liquidity fees and redemption gate requirements. The potential impact of the rules that
affect the structure of the funds, which have a two-year compliance period, on BlackRock’s business remains untested; they may, however, reduce the attractiveness of certain money market funds to investors.

Regulation of Derivatives

The SEC, the Internal Revenue Service
(“IRS”) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) each continue to review the use of futures, swaps and other derivatives by mutual funds. Such reviews could result in regulations that further limit the use of such
products by mutual funds. If adopted, these limitations could require BlackRock to change certain mutual fund business practices or to register additional entities with the CFTC, which could result in additional costs and/or restrictions. BlackRock
also reports certain information about a number of its private funds to the SEC and certain information about a number of its commodity pools to the CFTC, under systemic risk reporting requirements adopted by both agencies. These reporting
obligations have required, and will continue to require, investments in people and systems to assure timely and accurate reporting.

Further, the full
implementation of regulations under the DFA relating to regulation of swaps and derivatives will impact the manner in which BlackRock-advised funds and accounts use and trade swaps and other derivatives, increasing the costs of derivatives trading
for BlackRock’s clients. For example, CFTC, and eventually SEC rules and regulations applicable to offshore funds, accounts and counterparties will require BlackRock to build and implement new compliance monitoring procedures to address the
enhanced level of oversight to which it will be subject. These rule changes also introduce new requirements for centrally clearing certain swap, and eventually security-based swap, transactions and for executing certain swap, and eventually
security-based swap, transactions on or through CFTC or SEC-registered trading venues. Jurisdictions outside the United States in which BlackRock operates also have adopted and implemented, or are in the process of considering, adopting or
implementing more pervasive regulation of many elements of the financial services industry, which could further impact BlackRock and the broader markets. This includes the implementation of mandated central clearing of swaps in the European
Union (“EU”) and the implementation of trade reporting, documentation, central clearing and other requirements in various jurisdictions globally.

Regulation of ETFs

Globally, regulators are examining the potential risks
in ETFs and may impose additional regulations on ETFs. Depending on the outcome of this analysis, these products may be restricted in some ways and may require BlackRock to incur additional compliance expenses, which may adversely affect the
Company’s business.

Benchmark Reform

The IOSCO published
principles for regulatory oversight of financial benchmarks in 2013, with standards applying to methodologies for benchmark calculation, and transparency and governance issues in the benchmarking process; some national and regional regulators are
currently reviewing how













to apply these principles, with a draft European Regulation published in September 2013. Similarly, in July 2014, the FSB published a report aimed at reforming major interest rate benchmarks.
These regulations may result in business disruptions, which could adversely impact the value of assets in which asset managers, including BlackRock, have invested directly or on behalf of their clients. To the extent the regulations strictly control
the activities of financial services firms, could make it more difficult for BlackRock to conduct certain businesses.

Taxation

BlackRock’s global business may be impacted by the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (“FATCA”), which was enacted in 2010 and introduced expansive new
investor onboarding, withholding and reporting rules aimed at ensuring U.S. persons with financial assets outside of the United States pay appropriate taxes. In many instances, however, the precise nature of what needs to be implemented will be
governed by bilateral Intergovernmental Agreements (“IGAs”) between the United States and the countries in which BlackRock does business. While many of these IGAs have been put into place, others have yet to be concluded. The FATCA rules
will impact both U.S. and non-U.S. funds and subject BlackRock to extensive additional administrative burdens. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has also recently launched a base erosion and profit shifting
(“BEPS”) proposal that aims to rationalize tax treatment across jurisdictions. If the BEPS proposal becomes the subject of legislative action in the format proposed, it could have unintended taxation consequences for collective investment
vehicles and the Company’s tax position, which could adversely affect BlackRock’s financial condition.

In addition, certain individual EU Member States,
such as France and Italy, have enacted national financial transaction taxes (“FTTs”). There has also been renewed momentum by several other Member States to introduce FTTs, which would impose taxation on a broad range of financial
instrument and derivatives transactions. In general, any tax on securities and derivatives transactions would impact investors and would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the securities and derivatives markets, could diminish the
attractiveness of certain types of products that we manage in those countries and could cause clients to shift assets away from such products. An FTT could significantly increase the operational costs of our entering into, on behalf of our clients,
securities and derivatives transactions that would be subjected to an FTT, which could adversely impact our financial results and clients’ performance results.

BlackRock’s business could also be impacted to the extent there are other changes to tax laws. For example, the administration recently announced its proposed U.S.
federal budget, which called for new industry fees for financial firms. To the extent such fees are adopted and found to apply to BlackRock, they could adversely affect the Company’s financial results.

Regulation of Securities Lending

In its 2014 Annual Report, the FSOC
identified securities lending indemnification by asset managers as a potential systemic risk that required further review and monitoring. In addition, in January 2015, the European Parliament published its draft report on the European
Commission’s proposal for a European regulation on the reporting and transparency of securities financing transactions (“SFT”).

The SFT regulation aims to improve the transparency surrounding SFTs and limit the perceived risks of SFTs by, among other things, requiring central reporting of SFTs, requiring disclosure of
SFTs to investors and imposing minimum requirements relating to the difference in prices at which a market maker can buy and sell a security in SFTs. If the recent scrutiny of securities lending practices results in new regulatory requirements or
reporting obligations, BlackRock may be required to modify its securities lending activities or introduce additional compliance measures, which will subject the Company to additional expenses.

Volcker Rule

Provisions of the DFA referred to as the “Volcker
Rule” place limitations on the ability of banks and their subsidiaries to engage in proprietary trading and to invest in and transact with certain private investment funds, including hedge funds, private equity funds and funds of funds
(collectively “covered funds”). Because the Federal Reserve currently treats BlackRock as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC, BlackRock may be required to conform its activities to the requirements of the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule’s
restrictions would, among other things, limit BlackRock’s ability to invest in covered funds and require BlackRock to remove its name from the names of its covered funds, which could subject the Company to additional expense. The Volcker Rule
may also require BlackRock to sell certain seed and co-investments that it holds in covered funds, potentially at a discount to existing carrying value, depending on market conditions. The Volcker Rule may also reduce the level of market making and
liquidity activities of several of BlackRock’s trading counterparties, which may adversely impact the liquidity and, in some cases, the pricing of various financial instruments in which BlackRock client accounts invest. For a further discussion
of the Volcker Rule, see “Item 1A — Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Risks.”

Markets in Financial Instrument Directives













Organized Trading Facility for non-equity financial instruments, (viii) commodity derivative position limits and reporting requirements, (ix) a move away from vertical silos in
execution, clearing and settlement, (x) an enhanced role for ESMA in supervising EU securities and derivatives markets and (xi) new requirements regarding non-EU investment firms’ access to EU financial markets. Implementation of
these measures will have direct and indirect impacts on the Company and its subsidiaries and may require significant changes to client servicing models.

Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive

BlackRock’s European
business is impacted by the EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (“AIFMD”), which became effective on July 21, 2011. The AIFMD regulates managers of, and service providers to, a broad range of alternative investment funds
(“AIFs”) domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD also regulates the marketing of all AIFs inside the European Economic Area (“EEA”). The AIFMD is being implemented in stages, which
run through 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirements restrict alternative investment fund marketing and impose additional compliance and disclosure obligations regarding remuneration, capital requirements, leverage, valuation, stakes in
EU companies, depositaries, the domicile of custodians and liquidity management on BlackRock. These new compliance and disclosure obligations and the associated risk management and reporting requirements will subject BlackRock to additional
expenses.

Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities

The EU has also adopted directives on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in
transferable securities (“UCITS”) as regards depositary functions, remuneration policies and sanctions. The latest initiative in this area, UCITS V, which became effective in September 2014, seeks to align the depositary regime,
remuneration rules and sanctioning powers of regulators under the UCITS Directive with the requirements of the AIFMD. UCITS V is required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state during the second quarter of 2016. Similarly, in
August 2014 ESMA revised the guidelines it initially published in 2012 on ETFs and other UCITS funds. The guidelines introduced new collateral management requirements for UCITS funds concerning collateral received in the context of derivatives
using Efficient Portfolio Management (“EPM”) techniques (including securities

lending) and over-the-counter derivative transactions. These rules,
which are now in effect, required BlackRock to make a series of changes to its collateral management arrangements applicable to the EPM of its UCITS fund ranges. Compliance with the UCITS directives will cause BlackRock to incur additional expenses
associated with new risk management and reporting requirements.

Extension of Retail Distribution Review

BlackRock must also comply with newly implemented retail distribution rules aimed at enhancing consumer protections, overhauling mutual fund fee structures and
increasing professionalism in the retail investment sector. The rules were originally introduced in the United Kingdom and have since been introduced in other jurisdictions where BlackRock operates. Similarly, MiFID 2 will contain a ban on certain
advisers recovering commissions and other

nonmonetary benefits from fund managers. These rules, if implemented, may lead to changes to the fees and commissions BlackRock is able to charge to its clients, as well as to its client
servicing and distribution models.

EXISTING U.S. REGULATION - OVERVIEW

BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are currently subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the
“DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (“NFA”), the CFTC and other
government agencies and regulatory bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions laws and regulations established by
various agencies.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as
BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”) imposes stringent governance,
compliance, operational, disclosure and related obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of
the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with
the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.

BlackRock’s trading and investment activities for client accounts are regulated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), as well
as the rules of various U.S. and non-U.S. securities exchanges and self-regulatory organizations, including laws governing trading on inside information, market manipulation and a broad number of technical requirements (e.g., short sale limits,
volume limitations and reporting obligations) and market regulation policies in the United States and globally. Violation of any of these laws and regulations could result in restrictions on the Company’s activities and damage its reputation.
Furthermore, the SEC has recently promulgated new rules that give effect to a section of the DFA that requires municipal advisors (as that term is defined in the statute) to register with the SEC. The new rules require entities that provide certain
types of advice to, or on behalf of, or solicit municipal entities or certain other persons, to register with the SEC and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) as municipal advisors, thereby subjecting those entities to new or
additional regulation by the SEC and MSRB. BlackRock has registered one of its subsidiaries, BTC, as a municipal advisor under these new rules.

BlackRock manages a
variety of private pools of capital, including hedge funds, funds of hedge funds, private equity funds, collateralized debt obligations (“CDOs”), collateralized loan obligations (“CLOs”), real estate funds, collective investment
trusts, managed futures funds and hybrid funds. Congress, regulators, tax authorities and others continue to explore, on their own and in response to demands from the













investment community and the public, increased regulation related to private pools of capital, including changes with respect to investor eligibility, certain limitations on trading activities,
record-keeping and reporting, the scope of anti-fraud protections, safekeeping of client assets and a variety of other matters. BlackRock may be materially and adversely affected by new legislation, rule-making or changes in the interpretation or
enforcement of existing rules and regulations imposed by various regulators.

Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security
Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures
and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.

BlackRock has seven subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators (“CPOs”) and/or commodity trading advisors with the CFTC and are members
of the NFA. Additional BlackRock entities may need to register as a CPO or commodity trading advisor as a result of recently enacted regulatory changes by the CFTC. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures
contracts and various other financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Two of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”) and BlackRock
Execution Services, are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an
approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and a member of the MSRB, subject to MSRB rules.

U.S. Banking Regulation

PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC
Act”). As described in “Item 1-Business”, PNC owns approximately 22% of BlackRock’s capital stock. Based on the Federal Reserve’s interpretation of the BHC Act, the Federal Reserve currently takes the position that this
ownership interest causes BlackRock to be treated as a nonbank subsidiary of PNC for purposes of the BHC Act, thereby subjecting BlackRock to banking regulation, including the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking
laws, regulations and orders that apply to PNC, including the Volcker Rule. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its
depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. BlackRock may also be subject to
foreign laws and supervision that could affect its business.

BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a financial holding company
under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory

Any failure of PNC to
maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of PNC or one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain
“well capitalized” and “well managed,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community
Reinvestment Act.

One of BlackRock’s subsidiaries, BTC, is organized as a limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make
commercial loans and which is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing
fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with
affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s stockholders.

EXISTING INTERNATIONAL REGULATION — OVERVIEW

BlackRock’s
international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of a number of international jurisdictions, as well as oversight by numerous regulatory agencies and bodies in those jurisdictions. In some instances, they are also affected by U.S.
laws and regulations that have extra-territorial application.

Below is a summary of certain international regulatory standards to which BlackRock is subject. It is
not meant to be comprehensive as there are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in force in many jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries conduct business.













Of note among the various other international regulations to which BlackRock is subject, are the extensive and
increasingly stringent regulatory reporting requirements that necessitate the monitoring and reporting of issuer exposure levels (thresholds) across the holdings of managed funds and accounts and those of the Company.

European Regulation

The Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”)
currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. It also regulates those U.K. subsidiaries’ branches established in other European countries and the U.K. branches of certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries. In
addition, the Prudential Regulation Authority (the “PRA”) regulates one BlackRock U.K. subsidiary. Authorization by the FCA and the PRA is required to conduct certain financial services related business in the United Kingdom under the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FCA’s rules adopted under that Act govern the majority of a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients, and systems and
controls, whereas the rules of the PRA focus solely on the prudential requirements that apply to the Company’s U.K.-regulated insurance subsidiary. The FCA supervises the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries through a combination of
proactive engagement, event-driven and reactive supervision and thematic based reviews in order to monitor the Company’s compliance with regulatory requirements. Breaches of the FCA’s rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary
actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and/or its employees.

In addition, the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European
subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European regulatory regime established by MiFID, which became effective on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the wider EEA. MiFID,
the scope of which is being enhanced through MiFID 2 which is described more particularly under “— Global Regulatory Reform” above, sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms
and regulated markets. It also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements. Certain BlackRock entities must also comply with the U.K.’s Consolidated Life Directive
and Insurance Mediation Directive. In addition, relevant entities must comply with revised obligations on capital resources for banks and certain investment firms (the Capital Requirements Directive), which became effective in January 2014. These
include requirements not only on capital, but address matters of governance and remuneration as well. The obligations introduced through these directives will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.

BlackRock’s EU-regulated subsidiaries are additionally subject to an EU regulation on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories, which was
adopted in August 2012 and which requires (i) the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives, (ii) the application of risk-mitigation techniques to non-centrally cleared OTC derivatives and (iii) the reporting of all derivative
contracts from February 2014.

Regulation in the Asia-Pacific Region

In Japan, a BlackRock subsidiary is subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law

Concerning Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards
for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the
issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL. This Japanese subsidiary also holds a license for real estate brokerage activity which subjects it to the regulations set forth
in the Real Estate Brokerage Business Act.

In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and state laws and certain
subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). ASIC regulates companies and financial services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. Failure
to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.

The
activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and
provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and Futures Commission (the “SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The
relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC. Failure to comply with
the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.

BlackRock’s operations in Taiwan are regulated by the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission, which is responsible for regulating securities markets (including
the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the Taiwan Futures Exchange), the banking industry and the insurance sector. Other financial regulators oversee BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices across the Asia Pacific region, including in
Singapore and South Korea. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may
subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements.
