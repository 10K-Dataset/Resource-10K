investors and high net worth individuals. The Company is highly regulated, serves its clients as a fiduciary and derives all of its revenues from client business. We do not engage in proprietary trading or other activities that could conflict with
the interests of our clients.

The December 2009 combination of BlackRock and Barclays Global Investors (“BGI”)
created a firm with unsurpassed breadth of investment expertise and risk management capabilities across the global capital markets. Our unique platform enables us to offer active (alpha) investments with index (beta) products and risk management to
develop tailored solutions for clients. Our product range includes single- and multi-asset class portfolios investing in equities, fixed income, alternatives and/or money market instruments. We offer our products directly and through intermediaries

(“ETFs”) and other exchange-traded products (together with ETFs, “ETPs”), collective investment funds and separate accounts. We also offer ourBlackRock Solutions®(“BRS”) investment systems, risk management and advisory services to institutional investors.

BlackRock is an independent, publicly traded company, with no single majority shareholder and a majority of independent directors on its Board. At December 31, 2011 The PNC Financial Services Group,
Inc. (“PNC”) owned approximately 24.0% of BlackRock’s voting common shares outstanding and approximately 21.0% of total capital stock while Barclays Bank PLC (“Barclays”) held approximately 2.2% of BlackRock’s voting
common shares and approximately 19.7% of total capital stock.

Management seeks to achieve attractive returns for stockholders over time by,
among other things, capitalizing on the following factors:



•the Company’s diversified product offerings, which enhance its ability to offer a variety of traditional and alternative investment products
across the risk spectrum and to tailor single- and multi- asset class investment solutions to address specific client needs;



•the Company’s longstanding commitment to risk management and the continued development of, and increased interest in, BRS products and services;



•the Company’s global presence and commitment to best practices around the world, with approximately 43% of employees outside the U.S. supporting
local investment capabilities and serving clients, and approximately 44% of total AUM managed for clients domiciled outside the United States;



•the strength of the Company’s collaborative culture and unified technology platform that allows professionals to share and compare information
across teams and time zones, translating local insight in one part of the world into action in another; and



•the growing recognition of the global BlackRock brand, and the depth and breadth of the Company’s intellectual capital.

BlackRock operates in a global marketplace characterized by a high degree of market volatility and economic uncertainty,
factors that can significantly affect earnings and stockholder returns in any given period.

The Company’s ability to increase revenue,
earnings and stockholder value over time is predicated on its ability to generate new business, including business in BRS products and services. New business efforts are dependent on BlackRock’s ability to achieve clients’ investment
objectives in a manner consistent with their risk preferences and to deliver excellent client service. All of these efforts require the commitment and contributions of BlackRock employees. Accordingly, the ability to attract, develop and retain
talented professionals is critical to the Company’s long-term success.

Overview.

See additional information in Item 6, Selected Financial Data.

BlackRock reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”);
however, management believes that evaluating the Company’s ongoing operating results may be enhanced by also evaluating additional non-GAAP basis financial measures. Management reviews non-GAAP financial measures to assess ongoing operations
and, for the reasons described below, considers them to be effective indicators, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s financial performance over time. BlackRock’s management does not advocate that investors consider such
non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Operating
Income,as Adjusted. GAAP reported operating income includes certain significant items, the after-tax impact of which management considers non-recurring or transactions that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value and,
therefore, are excluded in calculating operating income, as adjusted.

Operating income, as adjusted (a non-GAAP measure), excludes certain
expenses incurred related to the integration of the acquisitions of Merrill Lynch Investment Managers (“MLIM”), the fund of funds business of Quellos Group, LLC (“Quellos”) and BGI, as well as advisory fees, legal fees and
consulting transaction expenses related to the acquisition of BGI from Barclays on December 1, 2009 (the “BGI Transaction”), a 2007 termination fee for closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, 2011 UK
lease exit costs, 2008, 2009 and 2011 restructuring charges and compensation expense associated with appreciation (depreciation) on assets related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans. These expenses have been excluded from operating
income, as adjusted, because they have been deemed non-recurring by management and to help enhance the comparability of this information to prior periods.

The portion of compensation expense associated with certain of BlackRock’s long-term incentive plan (“LTIP”) awards that has been or will be funded through distributions to participants of
shares of BlackRock stock held by PNC and a Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, has been excluded because, exclusive of the impact related to the exercise of LTIP participants’ put options,
primarily in the three months ended March 31, 2007, these charges do not impact BlackRock’s book value. The expense related to the Merrill Lynch cash compensation contribution ceased at the end of the third quarter 2011. A detailed
discussion of the LTIP funded by PNC is included in Note 13, Stock-Based Compensation, to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page F-1 of this Form 10-K.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Overview (continued)



Operating Income, as Adjusted (continued). Compensation expense associated with appreciation
(depreciation) on investments related to certain BlackRock deferred compensation plans has been excluded as returns on investments set aside for these plans, which substantially offset this expense, are reported in non-operating income (expense).

Management believes that operating income exclusive of these costs is a useful measure in evaluating BlackRock’s operating performance
and helps enhance the comparability of this information for the reporting periods presented.

Operating Margin, as Adjusted.Operating
income used for measuring operating margin, as adjusted, is equal to operating income, as adjusted, excluding the impact of closed-end fund launch costs and commissions. Management believes that excluding such costs and commissions is useful because
these costs can fluctuate considerably and revenues associated with the expenditure of these costs will not fully impact the Company’s results until future periods.

Operating margin, as adjusted, allows the Company to compare performance from period-to-period by adjusting for items that may not recur, recur infrequently or may fluctuate based on market movements,
such as restructuring charges, transaction/integration costs, UK lease exit costs, closed-end fund launch costs and fluctuations in compensation expense based on mark-to-market movements in investments held to fund certain compensation plans. The
Company also uses operating margin, as adjusted, to monitor corporate performance and efficiency and as a benchmark to compare its performance with other companies. Management uses both the GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the
financial performance of BlackRock. The non-GAAP measure by itself may pose limitations because it does not include all the Company’s revenues and expenses.

Revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, excludes distribution and servicing costs paid to related parties and to other third parties. Management believes the exclusion of such costs is useful to
BlackRock because it creates consistency in the treatment for certain contracts for similar services, which due to the terms of the contracts, are accounted for under GAAP on a net basis within investment advisory, administration fees and securities
lending revenue. Amortization of deferred sales commissions is excluded from revenue used for operating margin measurement, as adjusted, because such costs, over time, substantially offset distribution fee revenue earned by the Company. Reimbursable
property management compensation represented compensation and benefits paid to personnel of Metric Property Management, Inc. (“Metric”), a subsidiary of BlackRock Realty Advisors, Inc. (“Realty”). Prior to the transfer in 2008 to
a third party, these employees were retained on Metric’s payroll when certain properties were acquired by Realty’s clients. The related compensation and benefits were fully reimbursed by Realty’s clients and have been excluded from
revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, because they did not bear an economic cost to BlackRock. BlackRock excludes from revenue used for operating margin, as adjusted, the costs related to each of these items as a proxy for such offsetting
revenues.

Non-Operating Income (Expense), Less Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Non-controlling Interests, as adjusted.Non-operating
income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests (“NCI”), as adjusted, equals non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis, less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, GAAP basis, adjusted for compensation
expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain deferred compensation plans. The compensation expense offset is recorded in operating income. This compensation expense has been included in non-operating income
(expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, to offset returns on investments set aside for these plans, which are reported in non-operating income (expense), GAAP basis.

Management believes that non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted, provides for comparability of this
information to reporting periods and is an effective measure for reviewing BlackRock’s non-operating contribution to its results. As compensation expense associated with (appreciation) depreciation on investments related to certain BlackRock
deferred compensation plans, which is included in operating income, offsets the gain (loss) on the investments set aside for these plans, management believes non-operating income (expense), less net income (loss) attributable to NCI, as adjusted,
provides a useful measure, for both management and investors, of BlackRock’s non-operating results that impact book value.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Overview (continued)



Net Income Attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted.Management believes net income
attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted, are useful measures of BlackRock’s profitability and financial performance. Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, equals net
income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., GAAP basis, adjusted for significant non-recurring items, charges that ultimately will not impact BlackRock’s book value or certain tax items that do not impact cash flow.

Net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc., as adjusted, and diluted earnings per common share, as adjusted (non-GAAP measures), exclude the after-tax
impact of the 2008, 2009 and 2011 restructuring charges, UK lease exit costs, the 2007 termination of closed-end fund administration and servicing arrangements with Merrill Lynch, LTIP expense to be funded by PNC and by a Merrill Lynch cash
compensation contribution, a portion of which has been received, the MLIM, Quellos and BGI integration costs, BGI transaction costs, the effect on deferred income tax expense attributable to changes in corporate income tax rates as a result of
legislation and a state tax election.

See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations, for a detailed reconciliation of GAAP reported operating income, non-operating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. and diluted earnings per common
share to adjusted non-GAAP operating income, non-operating income (expense) less net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests, net income attributable to BlackRock, Inc. and diluted earnings per common share.

Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Overview (continued)



AUM represents the broad ranges of financial assets we manage for clients on a discretionary basis
pursuant to investment management agreements that are expected to continue for at least 12 months. In general, reported AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for billing (for example, net asset value). Reported
AUM does not include assets for which we provide risk management or other forms of non-discretionary advice, or assets that we are retained to manage on a short-term, temporary basis (for example, in a transition mandate, as described below).

Investment management fees are typically expressed as a percentage of net asset value. We also earn performance fees on
certain portfolios relative to an agreed-upon benchmark or return hurdle. On some products, we also may earn securities lending fees. In addition, BlackRock offers its proprietaryAladdin®investment system as well as risk management, outsourcing and advisory services, to institutional investors under the BRS name. Revenue for these services may be
based on several criteria including value of positions, number of users, accomplishment of specific deliverables or other objectives.

At
December 31, 2011, total AUM was $3.513 trillion, representing a compound annual growth rate of 26% over the last five years. AUM growth during the period was achieved through the combination of net market valuation gains, net new business and
mergers, including the acquisitions of the fund-of-funds business of Quellos, which added approximately $21.9 billion of assets in 2007 and BGI, which added approximately $1.844 trillion of assets in December 2009. These acquisitions significantly
changed our AUM mix, from predominantly active fixed income and equity in 2005 to a broadly diversified product range, as described below.

At year-end 2011, long-term assets totaled $3.138 trillion, or 89% of
total AUM, with 50% in equities, 40% in fixed income, 7% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternative investments. The remaining $374.7 billion of AUM represented cash management and long-term liquidation advisory mandates. In 2011, we generated $67.3
billion of net new business in long-term products before $28.3 billion of BGI merger-related outflows (see below). Net inflows in long-term products were partially offset by $22.9 billion of net outflows in cash management, largely reflecting
institutional reaction to the continued low rate environment and $29.9 billion of planned net distributions from advisory portfolios.

Unless
stated otherwise, net new business figures are before giving effect to BGI merger-related outflows. Total merger-related outflows since the BGI Transaction represented less than 9% of the acquired AUM.

Equity and Fixed Income.Total equity and fixed income AUM reflects the diversity of our model
and includes a wide range of both active and passive strategies (including our institutional index and iSharesproducts). Year-end 2011 equity AUM of $1.560 trillion decreased $134.4 billion or 8% from the end of 2010, largely reflecting the
effect of lower market valuations. Net new business of $24.1 billion was more than offset by $130.9 billion of market valuation and foreign exchange losses. Passive strategies represented 82% of equity AUM with the remaining 18% managed in active
mandates. Fixed income AUM ended 2011 at $1.248 trillion, rising $106.4 billion, or 9%, relative to December 31, 2010, reflecting $4.3 billion of net new business and $102.6 billion of market valuation and foreign exchange gains. Fixed income
AUM was almost evenly split between passive and active mandates with 51% and 49%, respectively. BGI merger-related outflows totaled $27.6 billion and $0.5 billion in equities and fixed income, respectively, primarily reflecting the effect of manager
concentration considerations combined with outflows in scientific active equities (“SAE”) due to past performance. (See additional discussion under “AUM by Investment Style,” below.)

Investment advisory and administration fees for the majority of our investment products are calculated using daily or monthly average AUM. During
periods of significant market volatility, quarterly average AUM may differ from actual average AUM used for billing purposes. For example, for the fourth quarter of 2011, equity market volatility caused the quarterly and monthly averages to
differ by more than 2% for equities. Specifically, quarterly average AUM for active, index andiSharesequities was $271 billion, $828 billion and $402 billion, while monthly average AUM was $280 billion, $851 billion and $415 billion,
respectively.

In addition, BlackRock’s effective fee rates fluctuate due to changes in AUM mix. Approximately 50% of BlackRock’s
equity AUM is tied to international markets, including emerging markets, which tend to have higher fee rates than similar U.S. equity strategies. Accordingly, fluctuations in international equity markets, which do not consistently move in tandem
with U.S. markets, may have a greater impact on BlackRock’s effective equity fee rates and revenues.

Multi-asset class AUM totaled $225.2 billion at year-end 2011, up 21% or $39.6 billion. During the year, we were awarded
$42.7 billion of net new business, while portfolio values declined by $3.1 billion. BlackRock’s multi-asset class team manages a variety of bespoke mandates for a diversified client base that leverage our broad investment expertise in global
equities, currencies, bonds and commodities, and our extensive risk management capabilities. Investment solutions might include a combination of long-only portfolios and alternative investments as well as tactical asset allocation overlays.

At December 31, 2011, institutional investors represented 63% of multi-asset class AUM, while retail and high net worth investors
accounted for 37%. At year-end 2011, 55% of multi-asset class AUM was managed for clients based in the Americas, 38% in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and 7% in Asia-Pacific. Flows reflected ongoing institutional demand for
our advice in an increasingly challenging investment environment with $35.7 billion or 84% of net new inflows from institutional clients and $6.7 billion or 16% from retail investors. During the year, clients in the Americas and EMEA awarded
BlackRock net new business of $44.2 billion, which was partially offset by net outflows of $1.5 billion from clients in Asia-Pacific.



•Asset allocation and balanced productsrepresented 56%, or $126.1 billion of multi-asset class AUM at year-end, up $11.0 billion as strong net
new business of $17.0 billion was partially offset by market valuation losses of $6.0 billion. These strategies combine equity, fixed income and alternative components for institutional investors seeking a tailored solution relative to a specific
benchmark and within a risk budget. In certain cases, these strategies seek to minimize downside risk through diversification, derivatives strategies and tactical asset allocation decisions. Our industry-leading global allocation funds garnered over
$7.5 billion in net inflows for the year, finishing 2011 with over $70 billion in AUM.

strong partnership with the client’s investment staff and trustees in order to tailor investment strategies to meet client-specific risk budgets and return objectives.

Alternatives totaled $104.9 billion at year-end 2011, down $4.8 billion, largely due to net outflows of $3.8 billion. Net inflows of $2.4 billion into
single-strategy hedge funds were largely offset by outflows from other core alternatives products. Commodities net inflows of $1.8 billion were offset by net outflows of $5.6 billion from active and passive currency strategies. Net market valuation
declines of $0.9 billion also dampened results. We continued to make significant investments in our alternatives platform in 2011, including the addition of three new hedge funds, a suite of new alternatives mutual funds and direct private equity as
well as the formation of a strategic relationship with NTR plc to launch renewable power products. We believe that as alternatives become more mainstream and investors adapt their asset allocation strategies to best meet their investment objectives,
they will further increase their use of alternative investments to complement core holdings. With highly-regarded alternative investment experts armed with industry-leading access to information, insights and deal flow and a multi-faceted risk
management process, BlackRock is well positioned to capitalize on this trend and has been recognized for achievements in the alternatives space.

Institutional investors represented 73%, or $76.5 billion, of alternatives AUM with retail and high net worth investors comprising an additional 9%, or $9.1 billion, at December 31, 2011.iSharescommodities products represented the remaining $19.3 billion, or 18%, of AUM at year end. The geographic mix was well diversified, with 56% of AUM managed for clients in the Americas, 22% for clients in EMEA and 22% for clients in
Asia-Pacific.

The BlackRock Alternative Investors (“BAI”) group coordinates our alternative investment efforts, including product
management, business development and client service. Our alternatives products fall into two main categories – core, which includes hedge funds, funds of funds and real estate offerings, and currency and commodities. The products offered under
the BAI umbrella are described below.

Core:



•Hedge Fundsended the year with $28.0 billion of AUM, up $1.3 billion as $2.0 billion of net inflows into multi-strategy and global macro hedge

clients worldwide sought our expertise in customized accounts and commingled vehicles.



•Real EstateAUM totaled $12.8 billion in a variety of real estate debt and equity products. AUM decreased $0.1 billion as $0.3 billion of net

AUM in currency and commodities strategies totaled $41.3 billion at year-end 2011, down $4.8 billion during the year, reflecting
$3.8 billion of net outflows, primarily in active currency and currency overlays, and $1.0 billion of market valuation declines. These products include a range of active and passive products primarily managed through institutional separate accounts.
OuriSharescommodities products represented $19.2 billion of AUM and are not eligible for performance fees.

Cash Management and
Securities Lending.Cash management AUM totaled $254.7 billion at December 31, 2011, down $24.5 billion, or 9%, from year-end 2010. Cash management products include taxable and tax-exempt money market funds and customized separate accounts.
Portfolios may be denominated in U.S. dollar, Euro or British pound.

At year-end 2011, 84% of cash AUM was managed for institutions
and 16% for retail and high net worth investors. The investor base was also predominantly domestic, with 70% of AUM managed for investors in the Americas and 30% for clients in other regions, mostly EMEA-based. We suffered net outflows during the
year, as investors sought higher yields in bank deposits, direct money market investments and longer-term assets. Among institutional investors, we saw the movement of unprecedented levels of cash to U.S. domiciled bank accounts, partially due to
the unlimited guarantee from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) on bank deposits. Additionally, retail investors looked to different asset classes in search of higher yields as cash rates remained low. We expect flows in
cash management to remain volatile due to continued global market uncertainty, persistent low interest rates and potential regulatory changes.

The cash management team also invests the cash we receive as collateral for securities on loan in other portfolios. Securities lending, which is offered
as a potential source of incremental returns on long-term portfolios, is managed by a dedicated team, supported by quantitative analysis, proprietary technology and disciplined risk management. Fees for securities lending can be structured as a
share of earnings and/or a percentage of the value of the cash collateral. The value of the securities on loan and the revenue earned is captured in the corresponding asset class being managed. The value of the collateral is not included in AUM.

Outstanding loan balances ended the year at approximately $120 billion, up from $104 billion at year-end 2010. The majority of the increase
occurred during the second quarter, with balances remaining relatively stable through the remainder of the year. Demand generally strengthened in the latter part of the year, as equity market volatility rose in response to the European debt crisis.
The strong rally in December raised notional values on loans and offset any decline in end-user borrowing due to falling volatility. The proportion of securities commanding premium lending fees grew slowly through the year, and started 2012 above
the 2011 average.

BlackRock employs a conservative investment style for cash and securities lending collateral that emphasizes quality,
liquidity and superior client service through all market cycles. Disciplined risk management, including a rigorous credit surveillance process, is an integral part of the investment process. BlackRock’s Cash Management Risk Committee has
established risk limits, such as aggregate issuer exposure limits and maturity limits, across many of the products BlackRock manages, including over all of its cash management products. In the ordinary course of our business, there may be instances
when a portfolio may exceed an internal risk limit or when an internal risk limit may be changed. No such instances, individually or in the aggregate, have been material to the Company. To the extent that daily evaluation/reporting of the profile of
the portfolios identifies that a limit has been exceeded, the relevant portfolio will be adjusted. To the extent a portfolio manager would like to obtain a temporary waiver of a risk limit, the portfolio manager must obtain approval from the credit
research team, which is independent from the cash management portfolio managers. While a risk limit may be waived, such temporary waivers are infrequent.

Long-term1product offerings include active and passive (index) strategies. Our
active strategies seek to earn attractive returns in excess of a market benchmark or performance hurdle (alpha) while maintaining an appropriate risk profile. In contrast, passive strategies seek to closely track the returns of a corresponding index
(beta), generally by investing in substantially the same underlying securities within the index or in a subset of those securities selected to approximate a similar risk and return profile of the index.

Although many clients use both active and passive strategies, the application of these strategies differs greatly. For example, clients may use index
products to gain exposure to a market or asset class pending reallocation to an active manager. This has the effect of increasing turnover of index AUM. In addition, institutional index assignments tend to be very large (multi-billion dollars) and
typically reflect low fee rates. This has the potential to exaggerate the significance of net flows in institutional index on BlackRock’s revenues and earnings.

We offer two types of active strategies: those that rely primarily on
fundamental research and those that utilize primarily quantitative models to drive portfolio construction. Long-term active AUM decreased $2.8 billion to $1.188 trillion at year-end 2011 with 23% in equities, 52% in fixed income, 18% in multi-asset
class and 7% in alternatives. Favorable markets contributed $7.4 billion of growth, which was partially offset by $2.7 billion of net outflows, largely reflecting investors’ risk-averse posture in equities and fixed income throughout most of
the year. AUM growth was hampered by BGI merger-related outflows of $7.5 billion, primarily in SAE.

Active Equity.Active equity AUM of $275.2 billion decreased 18%, or $59.4 billion, from year-end
2010. Results reflected $29.6 billion of market valuation losses and net outflows of $22.9 billion before the final merger-related outflows of $6.9 billion in the first half of 2011. Active equity reflects a broad product set including global and
regional portfolios; value, growth and core products; large, mid and small cap strategies; and selected sector funds. We believe an improving U.S. economy, strong corporate balance sheets and sustained growth in the emerging markets bodes well for
equity markets in 2012, although geopolitical risks, particularly in Europe, continue to weigh heavily on investors’ psyches.

BlackRock manages active equity portfolios for a diverse base of institutional and retail clients globally. At December 31, 2011, 46% of our active
equity AUM, or $125.5 billion, was managed on behalf of institutional investors in separate accounts, collective investment trusts and mutual funds and 54%, or $149.7 billion, was managed for retail and high net worth investors, largely through
open-end mutual funds and separately managed accounts. Approximately 48% of our active equity AUM was managed for investors based in the Americas, 38% in EMEA and 14% in Asia-Pacific.



•Fundamental active equityended 2011 with $208.5 billion in AUM. Net inflows of $3.7 billion in U.S. equity and sector-specific strategies were
more than offset by outflows of $8.6 billion in global and non-U.S. regional mandates. Market valuation losses of $25.3 billion further eroded AUM. Our fundamental active equity strategies seek to add value relative to a specified index or on an
absolute basis, primarily through a combination of proprietary research and portfolio manager judgment. In total, 44%, 54% and 86% of fundamental active equity AUM outperformed their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year
periods ended December 31, 2011, respectively.



•Scientific active equityAUM declined 30% to $66.7 billion, driven by net outflows of $18.0 billion before giving effect to $6.4 billion of BGI
merger-related outflows recorded in the first quarter of 2011. Market valuation losses of $4.3 billion further weighed on results. SAE strategies seek superior investment outcomes through a stock selection process that aims to systematically find
and exploit pricing opportunities, while rigorously managing risk and cost. As a result of recent investments in the platform, we continue to generate improving performance with 56%, 53% and 43% of SAE AUM outperforming their benchmarks or peer
medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2011, respectively.

Active Fixed Income.Active fixed income AUM ended 2011 at $614.8 billion, an increase of 4%, or $22.5 billion, from the end of 2010, reflecting market valuation gains of $40.3 billion, which were partially offset by $17.4 billion of net outflows. Fixed income
mandates are often tailored to client-specified liabilities, accounting, regulatory or rating agency requirements, or other investment policies. Overall, U.S. bonds enjoyed solid absolute returns in 2011, as demonstrated by a 7.8% return in the
Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Index. While sovereign credit risk remains a concern, particularly in parts of Europe, we currently expect Federal Reserve policy in the U.S. to target stable interest rates.

Total active fixed income AUM included 81% in institutional assets and 19% in retail and high net worth assets. The client base reflects our historical
roots with 70% of active fixed income AUM managed for investors in the Americas, 21% for EMEA-domiciled clients and 9% for investors in the Asia-Pacific region. Net inflows of $3.8 billion from Asia-Pacific clients were more than offset by outflows
of $21.2 billion from investors in the Americas and EMEA.



•Fundamental fixed incomeAUM totaled $571.1 billion, or 93%, of active fixed income AUM at year-end 2011. These products emphasize
risk-controlled sector rotation and security selection driven by sector experts and direct interaction with issuers and market makers. Fundamental strategies increased $17.6 billion, driven by $37.2 billion of market valuation gains. These results
were partially offset by $19.2 billion of net outflows, largely reflecting the effect of client changes in overall asset allocation (re-balancing), long-term performance concerns and interest in indexation. Positive flows of $8.9 billion into
domestic specialty mandates such as U.S. credit, high yield and inflation protected products and $6.0 billion into U.S. municipal bonds were more than offset by outflows of $13.0 billion from local currency strategies and $10.0 billion of outflows
from U.S. core funds. Fundamental taxable fixed income strategies ended the year with 43%, 78% and 43% of AUM above their benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three-, and five-year periods ended December 31, 2011, respectively, while our
active tax-exempt business showed strong results with 61%, 66% and 73% of AUM above their benchmarks or peer medians for the same time periods.

•Model-based fixed incomeAUM grew $4.9 billion, or 13%, ending the year at $43.7 billion, reflecting net inflows of $1.8 billion and $3.1

model-based fixed income strategies was strong, with 70%, 86% and 83% of AUM above benchmarks or peer medians for the one-, three- and five-year periods ended December 31, 2011, respectively.

Multi-asset class and Alternatives.Active strategies represented 97% of multi-asset class AUM and 76% of AUM in alternative investments. These

(1)Includes BGI merger-related outflows due to manager concentration considerations prior to third quarter 2011.

Institutional index AUM, generally managed in common trust funds or separate accounts, comprised 39% of total AUM at December 31, 2011. Long-term
AUM growth of $6.5 billion was driven by net new business of $17.1 billion, before the effect of the final BGI merger-related outflows, and $10.2 billion of market valuation gains. Merger-related outflows of $20.7 billion were concentrated among a
small number of clients.



•Equity products comprised 64% of institutional index AUM, ending the year at $865.3 billion, with net inflows of $22.4 billion more than offset by
market valuation declines of $48.2 billion. Net inflows of $34.6 billion across global equity, regional strategies and currency overlays were partially offset by outflows of $11.6 billion from U.S. equity mandates. Toward year-end, U.S. equities
experienced modest net inflows in the face of more stable economic and market conditions. Institutional index equity portfolios closely tracked their corresponding benchmarks with 96%, 84%, and 98% of AUM at or above tracking error tolerance for the
one-, three-, and five-year periods ended December 31, 2011, respectively.



•Fixed income products represented 35%, or $479.1 billion, of institutional index AUM, an increase of 12% or $53.2 billion. Net outflows totaled $5.2
billion, reflecting outflows of $14.6 billion in local currency mandates, only partly offset by inflows of $9.4 billion across global and U.S. core, sector-specialty and target duration strategies. Investors generally sought the relative safety of
U.S. fixed income products and retreated from European exposure as uncertainty around the sovereign debt crisis continued. Institutional index fixed income portfolios closely tracked their respective benchmarks with 97%, 92%, and 99% of AUM at or
above tracking error tolerance for the one-, three, and five-year periods ended December 31, 2011, respectively.



•Less than 1% of institutional index AUM is in alternatives or multi-asset class products. (See discussions under “Products - Asset Classes,”

The ETP industry experienced another strong year with $173 billion of net new business and positive
inflows for 11 months of the year2. The industry expanded
to include over 4,200 products globally with year-end AUM totaling $1.5252trillion. The broad spectrum of available ETP asset classes attracted new money through periods that were characterized as both “risk-on” and “risk-off.”

The global growth of the ETP market reflects both continued adoption and new product introduction with investor product preferences driven to varying
degrees by performance (as measured by tracking error, which is the difference between net returns on the ETP and the corresponding targeted index), liquidity (bid-ask spread), tax-efficiency, transparency and client service. Growth was lower than
in recent years, primarily due to unfavorable market movements. Industry asset growth has historically been linked to positive markets, with investors looking to capitalize on strong market returns. In the continued environment of ultra-low interest
rates, industry flows shifted toward fixed income oriented products and, within equities, to developed markets and away from broad and single-country emerging market funds.

iSharesis the leading ETP provider in the world, with $593.4 billion of AUM at December 31, 2011, which increased $3.1
billion, or 1%, since year-end 2010.iShareswas the top asset gatherer globally in 20112with $53.0 billion of net inflows largely offset by $49.9 billion of market valuation declines. During 2011,iSharesintroduced 45 new ETPs and continued our dual commitment to innovation and
responsible product structuring. Our broad product range offers investors a precise, transparent and low-cost way to tap market returns and gain access to a full range of asset classes and global markets that have been difficult or expensive for
many investors to access until now, as well as the liquidity required to make adjustments to their exposures quickly and cost-efficiently.

At
year-end,iSharesAUM included $419.7 billion, or 71%, in equity offerings, $153.8 billion, or 26%, in fixed income ETPs and $19.9 billion, or 3%, in multi-asset class and alternative investments.iSharesequity AUM decreased $28.5

iSharesoffers the most diverse product set in the industry with
504 ETPs at year-end 2011 and serves the broadest client base, covering 25 countries on five continents including North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Australia2.iSharesremained the ETP leader in top asset gathering in 2011 with four of the top ten products and the
highest number of leading products as measured by total assets, with five of the top ten2. Notwithstanding an increase in the number of ETP products offered in the industry,iSharescontinued to maintain the largest share of global AUM with 39% at year-end December 31, 20112.

•U.S.iSharesAUM ended at $444.4 billion with $29.6 billion of net inflows driven by strong demand for our yield-oriented and equity
dividend products with our flagship emerging markets fund also attracting strong flows in the fourth quarter 2011. However, the search for yield did not deter investment in low-rate U.S. government bond ETPs, which attracted significant flows. U.S.
broad aggregate bond ETPs also remained popular, allowing investors to capture diversified exposures. At year-end 2011,iShareswas the largest U.S. provider with 42% share of AUM3.



•InternationaliSharesAUM ended at $149.0 billion with robust net new business of $23.4 billion for the year, dominated by developed
countries equity products. Sovereign and bank debt concerns in Europe spurred a “flight to safety”, leading to strong investments into Europe-listed ETPs offering exposure to German equities. A DAX index-basediSharesproduct led
European ETPs overall, with net new inflows of $11.6 billion. At year-end 2011,iShareswas the largest European provider with 36% of AUM and 79% of total 2011 industry inflows in the European market3.

In addition, we were the largest ETP manager in Latin America with over 80% of AUM at December 31, 20113. We continue to look for opportunities to further diversify product
offerings in key strategic focus areas including attractive, high-growth markets as demonstrated by the July 2011 launch ofiSharesCOLCAP, the first ETP in the Colombian market; and by our January 2012 announced acquisition of the Canadian
ETP provider Claymore Investments. In general, we expect to maintain relatively stable pricing, so long as it is supported by performance and theiSharesvalue proposition, although we continually seek to achieve efficiencies and pass them on
to our clients.

BlackRock Solutions.BlackRock Solutionsoffers investment management technology
systems, risk management services and advisory services on a fee basis. In 2011, approximately $10.2 trillion of positions were processed on ourAladdinproprietary technology platform, which serves as the investment system for both BlackRock
and a growing number of sophisticated institutional investors around the world. BRS also offers comprehensive risk reporting capabilities via theGreen Package®and risk management advisory services; interactive fixed income analytics through our web-based calculator,AnSer®; middle and back office outsourcing services; and investment accounting. BRS’ Financial Markets Advisory
(“FMA”) group provides services for a wide range of global clients, such as valuation and risk assessment of illiquid assets, portfolio restructuring, workouts and dispositions of distressed assets and financial and balance sheet
strategies.

In the face of increasing regulatory scrutiny, clients have increased their focus on risk management and demand for BRS services
continues to be robust. During the year, BRS added 50 net new assignments and ended the year with record revenues of $510 million, an increase of $50 million, or 11%, from 2010. This was driven by strong demand for our FMA,Aladdinand risk
management services, particularly in EMEA and in Asia-Pacific, where we added a number of new clients.Aladdinassignments are long-term contracts that provide significant levels of recurring revenue. At year-end, BRS served 166 clients,
including banks, insurance companies, official institutions, pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.

In FMA, the growing financial crisis in Europe led to several short-term risk analytics assignments including a few high-profile engagements. Overall, the nature of FMA assignments is shifting to
longer-term advisory and risk monitoring engagements. Advisory AUM decreased 20% to $120.1 billion, driven by $29.9 billion of planned client distributions reflecting our continued success in disposing of assets for clients at, or above, targeted
levels.

The BRS andAladdinteams continued to support key aspects of the BGI integration in 2011. These efforts are vital to
establishing a unified operating platform and consistent operating processes. We expect the integration of BGI’s extensive quantitative tools, risk management models and portfolio construction applications across asset classes to enhance theAladdinplatform over time. Additionally, we will seek to leverage our scale for the benefit of our clients through the creation of a robust global trading platform in order to improve execution and enhance alpha as well as other initiatives.

Transition Management Services.BlackRock also offers transition management services, involving
the temporary oversight of a client’s assets as they transition from one manager to another or from one strategy to another. We provide a comprehensive service that includes project management and implementation based on achieving best
execution consistent with the client’s risk management tolerances. We use state-of-the-art tools and work closely with BlackRock’s global trading research team to manage four dimensions of risk throughout the transition: exposure,
execution, process and operational risk. The average transition assignment is executed within three weeks, although the duration can be longer or shorter depending on the size, complexity and liquidity of the related assets. These portfolios are not
included in AUM unless BlackRock has been retained to manage the assets after the transition phase.

Risk & Quantitative Analysis.Across all asset classes, in addition to the efforts of the portfolio management teams, the Risk & Quantitative Analysis (“RQA”) group at BlackRock draws on extensive analytical systems and proprietary and third-party data to
identify, measure and manage a wide range of risks. RQA provides risk management advice and independent risk oversight of the investment management processes, identifies and helps manage counterparty and operational risks, coordinates standards for
firm wide investment performance measurement and determines risk management-related analytical and information requirements. Where appropriate, RQA will work with portfolio managers and developers to facilitate the development or improvement of risk
models and analytics.

Product Performance Notes.Past performance is not indicative of future results. The performance
information shown is based on preliminarily available data. The performance information for actively managed accounts reflects U.S. open-end and closed-end mutual funds and similar EMEA-based products with respect to peer median comparisons, and
actively managed institutional and high net worth separate accounts and funds located globally with respect to benchmark comparisons, as determined using objectively based internal parameters, using the most current verified information available as
of December 31, 2011.

Accounts terminated prior to December 31, 2011 are not included. In addition, accounts that have not
been verified as of January 30, 2012 have not been included. If such terminated and other accounts had been included, the performance information may have differed substantially from that shown. The performance information does not include
funds or accounts that are not measured against a benchmark, any benchmark-based alternatives product, private equity products, CDOs, or liquidation accounts managed by BlackRock’s FMA group. Comparisons are based on gross-of-fee performance
for U.S. retail, institutional and high net worth separate accounts and EMEA institutional separate accounts and net-of-fee performance for EMEA based retail products. The performance tracking information for institutional index accounts is based on
gross-of-fee performance as of December 31, 2011, and includes all institutional accounts and alliSharesfunds globally using an index strategy. AUM information is based on AUM for each account or fund in the asset class shown without
adjustment for overlapping management of the same account or fund as of December 31, 2011. The information reported may differ slightly from that reported previously due to the increased number of accounts that have been verified since the last
performance disclosure. BlackRock considers these differences to be not material.

The source of performance information and peer medians is
BlackRock and is based in part on data from Lipper Inc. for U.S. funds and Morningstar, Inc. for non-U.S. funds. Fund performance reflects the reinvestment of dividends and distributions, but does not reflect sales charges.

Clients (overview)



BlackRock serves institutional and retail and high net worth (“HNW”) investors in more than
100 countries through the efforts of professionals located in 27 countries. We strive to leverage our global investment expertise and scale, together with our understanding of local requirements and business customs, to most effectively serve our
clients. Portfolios may be invested in local, regional or global capital markets. Products may be structured to address location-specific issues, such as regulations, taxation, operational infrastructure and market liquidity, and client-specific
issues, such as investment policy, liability structure and ratings.

Our matrix organizational structure facilitates strong teamwork globally
across both functions and regions in order to enhance our ability to leverage best practices to serve our clients and continue to develop our talent. The global functions – Portfolio Management, BRS, Global Client Groups and
Corporate & Business Operations – are key to driving coordination and consistency and to further enhancing the benefits of our scale. The regions – Americas, EMEA and Asia-Pacific – support local clients, employees,
regulators and business strategy. At December 31, 2011, 44% of our AUM was managed for clients outside the United States and 43% of employees were based outside the United States. We expect these figures to approach 50% over the coming years.
At December 31, 2011 our London office was the largest with 18% of our employees, followed by New York and San Francisco.

(1)Amounts based on jurisdiction of product, not underlying client.

Americas.At year-end 2011, assets managed on behalf of clients domiciled in the Americas (defined as the U.S., Caribbean, Canada, Latin America and Iberia), totaled $2.123 trillion or 60% of total
AUM down $54.0 billion, or 2%, since year-end 2010. Net new business in long-term products of $54.7 billion was insufficient to overcome outflows of $69.4 billion from cash and advisory and $29.2 billion in market valuation losses. During the year,
we served clients through offices in 30 states in the United States as well as Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Chile and Spain.

Product
offerings included closed-end funds andiSharestraded on various local stock exchanges, a full range of open-end mutual funds, collective investment funds, common trusts, private funds and separate accounts. Our long-term product mix is well
diversified and proportional to the firm’s mix with 53% in equities, 37% in fixed income, 7% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternatives. Cash management products predominantly serve clients in the Americas. We also have a wide variety of BRS
assignments for institutional investors and governmental entities in the United States and Canada.

Clients (overview)



The mix by investment style is also balanced, with 39% of long-term AUM managed in active products, 35%
in institutional index accounts and 26% iniSharesat year-end. (Note that theiSharesfigures are based on the jurisdiction of the product rather than the underlying investor. Non-U.S. investors often prefer U.S.iShares,
primarily due to the depth of the markets and liquidity of the products.)

EMEA.AUM for clients based in EMEA ended the year at $1.027
trillion, or 29%, of total AUM, an increase of $11.1 billion from year-end 2010. During the year, clients awarded us net new business of $23.5 billion, including inflows from investors in 19 countries across the region. Our offerings include fund
families in the U.K., Luxembourg and Dublin andiShareslisted on stock exchanges throughout Europe as well as separate accounts and pooled investment products.

Clients invested across the entire product spectrum with 46% of long-term AUM in equities, 43% in fixed income, 9% in multi-asset class and 2% in alternatives. EMEA clients constitute 30% of our cash
management products and represent 11% of our advisory AUM. BRS has steadily built its presence in EMEA, withAladdinrelationships with a variety of institutional investors and FMA engagements for financial services companies and official
institutions, including assignments for the Central Bank of Ireland and the National Bank of Greece.

The mix by investment style is slightly
more concentrated than in the Americas, with 36% invested in active products, 53% in institutional index accounts and 11% iniShares. The relatively higher percentage in institutional index is driven by low-fee institutional liability hedging
portfolios, which account for approximately 20% of total institutional index assets. The relatively lower percentage iniSharesprimarily reflects the earlier stage of development of the European ETP market and our lower installed share.

Asia-Pacific.Clients in the Asia-Pacific region are served through offices in Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and
Korea, and joint ventures in China and India. At December 31, 2011, we managed $362.3 billion of AUM for clients in the region, a decrease of 1%, or $5.3 billion, from year-end 2010. Net new business of $5.7 billion was offset by $2.3 billion
of unfavorable market movements and $8.7 billion of BGI merger-related outflows.

At year-end, the mix of long-term products managed
for these clients consisted of 43% equities, 47% fixed income, 4% multi-asset class and 6% alternative investments. Asia-Pacific clients represented 2% of our advisory AUM and less than 1% of our cash management products. BRS serves a select number
of the largest and most sophisticated investors in the region. We continue to grow our presence in the region with the addition of our first two multi-assetAladdinassignments in Japan.

The mix among investment styles was tilted more toward institutional index accounts than in the other regions, with $221.0 billion, or 62%, of long-term
AUM in these products. This bias can be traced to the presence of very large governmental institutions and pensions that are heavy users of index products. Asia-Pacific institutional investors also useiSharesfor tactical allocation, but
often favor the liquidity of the U.S. products (which are counted in AmericasiShares). Active mandates represented 36% of AUM managed for investors in the region at year-end.

Long-term assets managed for institutional investors totaled $2.181 trillion, or 62%, of total AUM at year-end 2011.
During the year, net new business in long-term products totaled $0.9 billion with investment performance and market appreciation contributing $41.5 billion.

BlackRock’s institutional business is well diversified by both product and region, with 45% of long-term AUM in equities, 45% in fixed income, 7% in multi-asset class and 3% in alternatives. The mix
by investment style was 38% active and 62% passive (excluding institutional investors iniShares). As noted earlier, institutional index accounts tend to be larger mandates managed for relatively low fee rates and subject to higher turnover.

We serve institutional investors on six continents, with 50% of long-term AUM managed on behalf of investors in the Americas, 35% in EMEA and
15% in Asia-Pacific. The institutional business is further diversified by sub-segments: tax-exempt, official institutions and taxable investors, as described below.

Clients (overview)



•BlackRock is among the largest managers of pension plan assets in the world with $1.502 trillion, or 69%, of long-term institutional AUM managed for
defined benefit and defined contribution and other pension plans for corporations, governments and unions at December 31, 2011. An additional $48.7 billion was managed for other tax-exempt investors, including charities, foundations and
endowments. Assets managed for these clients grew $6.9 billion during 2011, including $32.7 billion of long-term net inflows from defined contribution plans. We ended 2011 with $330.0 billion in defined contribution AUM and BlackRock remains well
positioned to capitalize on the on-going evolution of the defined contribution market and demand for outcome-oriented investments.



•We also managed $129.3 billion, or 6%, of long-term institutional AUM, for official institutions, including central banks, sovereign wealth funds,
supranationals, multilateral entities and government ministries and agencies at year-end 2011. These clients often require specialized investment policy advice, the use of customized benchmarks and training support.



•BlackRock is a top independent manager of assets for insurance companies, which accounted for $214.4 billion, or 10%, of institutional long-term AUM at
year-end 2011. Assets managed for other taxable institutions, including corporations, banks and third-party fund sponsors for which we provide sub-advisory services, totaled $287.3 billion or 13% of long-term institutional AUM at year-end.

Retail and High Net Worth Investors

December 31, 2011



(Dollar amounts in millions)AmericasEMEAAsia-PacificTotalEquity$88,792$50,968$16,652$156,412Fixed income102,9979,0293,029115,055Multi-asset class70,6857,4494,65082,784Alternatives3,9803,6691,4589,107Long-term retail/High net worth$266,454$71,115$25,789$363,358

BlackRock serves retail and high net worth investors globally through separate accounts, open-end and closed-end funds,
unit trusts and private investment funds. At December 31, 2011, long-term assets managed for retail and high net worth investors totaled $363.4 billion, down 3%, or $10.6 billion, versus year-end 2010. During the year, net inflows of $13.4
billion in long-term products were offset by market valuation declines of $24.0 billion.

Retail and high net worth investors are served
principally through intermediaries, including broker-dealers, banks, trust companies, insurance companies and independent financial advisors. Clients invest primarily in mutual funds, which totaled $286.4 billion, or 79%, of retail and high net
worth long-term AUM at year-end, with the remainder invested in private investment funds and separately managed accounts. The product mix is well diversified, with 43% of long-term AUM in equities, 32% in fixed income, 23% in multi-asset class and
2% in alternatives. The vast majority (98%) of long-term AUM is invested in active products, although this is partially inflated by the fact thatiSharesis shown as a separate client type, since we do not identify all of the underlying
investors.

The client base is also diversified geographically, with 73% of long-term AUM managed for investors based in the Americas, 20% in
EMEA and 7% in Asia-Pacific at year-end 2011.



•Americas retail and high net worthlong-term inflows of $16.8 billion were driven by strong demand for global allocation, U.S. sector-specialty
and municipal fixed income mutual fund offerings. Rising concerns over sovereign default risks, sustained market volatility and a low interest rate environment led investors to seek a more dynamic fixed income management approach versus a “buy
and hold” strategy. In the United States, we had over 70 product placements on broker-dealer platforms during the year and have grown our market position from tenth to fourth largest fund manager since we acquired Merrill Lynch Investment
Managers (“MLIM”) in late-20064. Our success in
attracting net new business even as the industry experienced heavy outflows resulted in our improved market share of 14% of long-term flows for 20114. In 2011, BlackRock won the Dalbar award for customer service in financial services, the twelfth occasion on which we
have been recognized for outstanding achievement in this area.

•International retailoutflows of $3.3 billion in 2011 were driven by continued trends toward de-risking, and were predominantly from regional
and country-specific equity strategies due to uncertainty in European markets. Overshadowed by fixed income and equity outflows, inflows of $0.6 billion into alternatives products demonstrate an appetite for alternatives in the retail channel. Our
international retail and high net worth offerings include our Luxembourg cross-border fund families, BlackRock Global Funds (“BGF”), BlackRock Strategic Funds with over $75.0 billion and $1.5 billion of AUM at year-end 2011, respectively,
and a range of retail funds in the U.K. BGF managed 64 funds registered in 35 jurisdictions at year-end 2011. Over 55% of the funds were rated by S&P. In 2011, we were ranked as the third largest cross border fund provider5. In the U.K., we ranked among the five largest fund managers5, and are known for our innovative product offerings, including the
absolute alpha products we introduced six years ago.

Our footprint in each of these regions reflects strong relationships
with intermediaries and an established ability to deliver our global investment expertise in funds and other products tailored to local regulations and requirements.

Competition.BlackRock competes with investment management firms, mutual fund complexes,
insurance companies, banks, brokerage firms and other financial institutions that offer products that are similar to, or alternatives to, those offered by BlackRock. In order to grow its business, BlackRock must be able to compete effectively for
AUM. Key competitive factors include investment performance track records, the efficient delivery of beta for passively managed products, investment style and discipline, client service and brand name recognition. Historically, the Company has
competed principally on the basis of its long-term investment performance track record, its investment process, its risk management and analytic capabilities and the quality of its client service. These factors may place BlackRock at a competitive
disadvantage and there can be no assurance that the Company’s strategies and efforts to maintain its existing AUM and to attract new business will be successful.

Geographic Information

At December 31, 2011, BlackRock had clients in over 100
countries across the globe, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan.

Regulation

Virtually all aspects of BlackRock’s business are subject to various laws and regulations both in and outside the United States, some of which are summarized below. These laws and regulations are
primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients, investors in registered and unregistered investment companies, trust customers of BlackRock Institutional Trust Company, N.A. (“BTC”), PNC and its bank subsidiaries and their
customers, and the financial system. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers, investment funds and financial and bank holding companies and their subsidiaries, such as BlackRock and its subsidiaries, have broad
administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit the regulated entity from carrying on business if it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions for significant compliance failures include the
suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser and other registrations, censures and fines. The rules governing the regulation of financial
institutions and their holding companies and subsidiaries are very detailed and technical. Accordingly, the discussion below is general in nature, does not purport to be complete and is current only as of the date of this report.

Regulatory Reform







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)



Additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by regulators and self-regulatory organizations, or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations may directly affect
the method of operation and profitability of BlackRock. BlackRock’s profitability also could be materially and adversely affected by modification of the rules and regulations that impact the business and financial communities in general,
including changes to the laws governing taxation, antitrust regulation and electronic commerce. See the Non-U.S. Regulation section below for a discussion of regulatory reforms being considered and/or adopted outside of the United States.

U.S. Regulation

BlackRock and certain of its U.S. subsidiaries are subject to regulation, primarily at the federal level, by the SEC, the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), the Federal Reserve, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency of the United States (the “OCC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the National Futures Association (the “NFA”), the CFTC and other government agencies and regulatory
bodies. Certain of BlackRock’s U.S. subsidiaries are also subject to various anti-terrorist financing, privacy, anti-money laundering regulations and economic sanctions, laws and regulations established by various agencies.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers such as
BlackRock, including record-keeping, operational and marketing requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities. The Investment Company Act imposes stringent governance, compliance, operational, disclosure and related
obligations on registered investment companies and their investment advisers and distributors, such as BlackRock. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act,
ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment advisers also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Non-compliance with the Advisers Act, the Investment Company Act or
other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, disgorgement, fines and reputational damage.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)



Certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), and to regulations promulgated thereunder by the DOL, insofar as they act
as a “fiduciary” under ERISA with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA
plan clients and impose excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions, mandate certain required periodic reporting and disclosures and require BlackRock to carry bonds ensuring against losses caused by fraud or dishonesty. ERISA also imposes
additional compliance, reporting and operational requirements on BlackRock that otherwise are not applicable to non-benefit plan clients.

BlackRock has two subsidiaries that are registered as commodity pool operators and commodity trading advisers, two other subsidiaries that are only
registered as commodity trading advisers and two additional subsidiaries only registered as commodity pool operators with the CFTC. All six of these subsidiaries are members of the NFA. Additional BlackRock entities may need to register as a
commodity pool operator or commodity trading adviser as a result of regulatory changes that the CFTC recently adopted in February 2012. The CFTC and NFA each administer a comparable regulatory system covering futures contracts and various other
financial instruments, including swaps as a result of the DFA, in which certain BlackRock clients may invest. Four of BlackRock’s other subsidiaries, BlackRock Investments, LLC (“BRIL”), BlackRock Capital Markets, LLC, BlackRock
Execution Services, and BlackRock Fund Distribution Company (“BFDC”) are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers and are member-firms of FINRA. Each broker-dealer has a membership agreement with FINRA that limits the scope of such
broker-dealer’s permitted activities. BRIL is also an approved person with the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”). BRIL and BFDC are members of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) and are subject to MSRB rules.

U.S. Banking Regulation

PNC is a bank holding company and regulated as a “financial holding company” by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHC Act”). Based on
PNC’s interests in and relationships with BlackRock, BlackRock is deemed to be a non-bank subsidiary of PNC and is therefore subject to the supervision and regulation of the Federal Reserve and to most banking laws, regulations and orders that
apply to PNC. The supervision and regulation of PNC and its subsidiaries under applicable banking laws is intended primarily for the protection of its banking subsidiaries, its depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation, and the financial system as a whole, rather than for the protection of stockholders, creditors or clients of PNC or BlackRock. PNC’s relationships and good standing with its regulators are important to the conduct of
BlackRock’s business. BlackRock may also be subject to foreign banking laws and supervision that could affect its business.

BTC is a
limited purpose national trust company that does not accept deposits or make commercial loans and is a member of the Federal Reserve System. Accordingly, BTC is examined and supervised by the OCC and is subject to various banking laws and
regulations enforced by the OCC, such as capital adequacy, regulations governing fiduciaries, conflicts of interest, self-dealing, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. BTC is also subject to various Federal Reserve regulations applicable
to member institutions, such as regulations restricting transactions with affiliates. Many of these laws and regulations are meant for the protection of BTC’s customers and not BTC, BlackRock and its affiliates, or BlackRock’s
stockholders.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)



BlackRock generally may conduct only activities that are authorized for a “financial holding
company” under the BHC Act. Investment management is an authorized activity, but must be conducted within applicable regulatory requirements, which in some cases are more restrictive than those BlackRock faces under applicable securities laws.
BlackRock may also invest in investment companies and private investment funds to which it provides advisory, administrative or other services, only to the extent consistent with applicable law and regulatory interpretations. The Federal Reserve has
broad powers to approve, deny or refuse to act upon applications or notices for BlackRock to conduct new activities, acquire or divest businesses or assets, or reconfigure existing operations. There are limits on the ability of bank subsidiaries of
PNC to extend credit to or conduct other transactions with BlackRock. PNC and its subsidiaries are also subject to examination by various banking regulators, which results in examination reports and ratings that may adversely impact the conduct and
growth of BlackRock’s businesses.

The Federal Reserve has broad enforcement authority over BlackRock, including the power to prohibit
BlackRock from conducting any activity that, in the Federal Reserve’s opinion, is unauthorized or constitutes an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting BlackRock’s business. The Federal Reserve may also impose substantial fines and other
penalties for violations of applicable banking laws, regulations and orders. The DFA strengthened the Federal Reserve’s supervisory and enforcement authority over a bank holding company’s non-bank affiliates, such as BlackRock.

Any failure of PNC to maintain its status as a financial holding company could result in substantial limitations on certain BlackRock activities and its
growth. Such a change of status could be caused by any failure of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries to remain “well capitalized,” by any examination downgrade of one of PNC’s bank subsidiaries, or by any failure of one of PNC’s
bank subsidiaries to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the DFA broadened the requirements for maintaining financial holding company status by now also requiring the holding company to remain “well
capitalized” and “well managed.”

Non-U.S. Regulation

BlackRock’s international operations are subject to the laws and regulations of non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. regulatory agencies and bodies.
As BlackRock continues to expand its international presence, a number of its subsidiaries and international operations have become subject to regulatory systems comparable to those affecting its operations in the United States.

The Financial Services Authority (the “FSA”) currently regulates certain BlackRock subsidiaries in the United Kingdom. Authorization by the FSA
is required to conduct any financial services related business in the United Kingdom pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The FSA’s rules made under that Act govern a firm’s capital resources requirements, senior
management arrangements, conduct of business, interaction with clients and systems and controls. Breaches of these rules may result in a wide range of disciplinary actions against the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries. The U.K. government
announced in 2010 that it intends to abolish the FSA and to establish three new regulatory bodies, the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of England, the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in its place. Detailed
proposals and draft legislation were published in mid-2011 and it is intended that completion of the necessary primary legislation will take place by the end of 2012 with transfers of power in early 2013. Pending formal implementation, the FSA has
introduced a shadow internal structure in anticipation of the creation of the Prudential Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority, and the Bank of England has created an interim Financial Policy Committee.

In addition to the above, the Company’s U.K.-regulated subsidiaries and other European subsidiaries and branches, must comply with the pan-European
regime established by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (“MiFID”), which became effective on November 1, 2007 and regulates the provision of investment services and activities throughout the European Economic Area
(“EEA”), as well as the Capital Requirements Directive, which delineates regulatory capital requirements. MiFID sets out detailed requirements governing the organization and conduct of business of investment firms and regulated markets. It
also includes pre- and post-trade transparency requirements for equity markets and extensive transaction reporting requirements.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)



The United Kingdom has adopted the MiFID rules into national legislation and FSA regulations, as have
those other European jurisdictions (excluding Switzerland which is not part of the EU or EEA) in which BlackRock has a presence. A review of MiFID by the European Commission has led to the publication of a draft amendment Directive and a draft new
Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation. The proposals, if implemented, are likely to result in changes to pre- and post-trade reporting obligations and an expansion of the types of instruments subject to these requirements. They may affect the
buying and selling of derivatives by moving most derivative trading onto regulated trading venues and may control the activities of algorithmic trading. The proposals may also result in changes to conduct of business requirements including selling
practices, intermediary inducements and client categorization. The proposals also envisage giving the European Commission power to ban certain products and services. A European Commission proposal (the European Market Infrastructure Regulation
(“EMIR”)), when implemented, will require the central clearing of standardized OTC derivatives.

In addition, the FSA is in the
process of finalizing its rules following its retail distribution review. These rules, which come into effect on December 31, 2012, will change how retail clients pay for investment advice given in respect of all retail investment products,
including open-ended and closed-ended funds, structured products and insurance-based savings products.

In the aftermath of the financial
crisis, the European Commission set out a detailed plan for EU financial reform, outlining a number of initiatives to be reflected in new or updated directives, regulations and recommendations of which the MiFID review (mentioned above) was part.
These will have direct and indirect effects on BlackRock’s operations in the EEA.

The EU Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive
(“AIFMD”), which became effective on July 21, 2011, needs to be implemented by EU member states by July 22, 2012. The AIFMD will regulate managers of, and service providers to, alternative investment funds (“AIFs”)
domiciled within and (depending on the precise circumstances) outside the EU. The AIFMD will also regulate the marketing of all alternative investment funds inside the EEA. In general, the AIFMD is expected to have a staged implementation between
mid-2013 and 2018. Compliance with the AIFMD’s requirement may restrict AIF marketing and place additional compliance obligations in the form of remuneration policies, capital requirements, leverage oversight, valuation, stakes in EU companies,
the domicile of custodians and liquidity management.

The European Commission has also published proposals to replace the Market Abuse
Directive with a regulation on insider dealing and market manipulation and with an accompanying directive on criminal sanctions. There are also ongoing plans to reform the framework to which regulated firms are subject, including in relation to
regulatory capital and the protection of client assets, which will have a direct effect on some of BlackRock’s European operations.

The
next iteration of the Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities Directive (“UCITS IV”), was required to be adopted in the national law of each EU member state by July 1, 2011. The United Kingdom has adopted
UCITS IV requirements into national legislation and FSA regulation. Luxembourg and Ireland have also adopted UCITS IV into their national legislation. However, several other EU member states are still in various stages of the adoption process. UCITS
IV introduced new requirements including a requirement on UCITS funds to provide a key investor information document. There are also European Commission consultations in process that are intended to improve retail investor protection, including
UCITS V, which addresses, among other items, custodial liability.

Recent proposals on packaged retail investment products (“PRIPs”)
are to be implemented through the strengthening of MiFID standards (for non-insurance PRIPs), revisions to the Insurance Mediation Directive’s selling standard (for all insurance-based PRIPs) and new investor disclosure requirements for all
PRIPs though a separate EU legislative process.

In addition, in September 2011, the European Commission proposed a financial transaction tax
(“FTT proposal”) in the European Union, which would, if approved by all 27 Member States, apply to all financial transactions where at least one party is established in an EU Member State and either that party or another party to the
transaction is a financial institution. While the specific terms of the FTT proposal remain subject to negotiation, any tax on securities transactions would likely have a negative impact on the liquidity of the derivatives and securities markets in
Europe and would adversely impact our European clients’ assets and our non-European clients to the extent that they are or want to be invested in European assets.

For the insurance sector the Solvency II process will increase the amount of capital that insurers will have to set aside and will have an indirect effect on fund managers with insurance clients.







Item 1.BUSINESS (continued)



Regulation (continued)



In addition to the FSA, the activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative
offices are overseen by financial services regulators in Germany, The Netherlands, Ireland, Luxembourg, Switzerland, Isle of Man, Jersey, Guernsey, France, Belgium, Italy, Poland, Spain and Sweden. Regulators in these jurisdictions have authority
with respect to financial services including, among other things, the authority to grant or cancel required licenses or registrations. In addition, these regulators may subject certain BlackRock subsidiaries to net capital requirements. Other
BlackRock subsidiaries, branches, and representative offices are regulated in Japan, Australia, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea, India, Dubai, Cayman Islands, Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada.

In Japan, certain BlackRock subsidiaries are subject to the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law (the “FIEL”) and the Law Concerning
Investment Trusts and Investment Corporations. These laws are administered and enforced by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (the “JFSA”), which establishes standards for compliance, including capital adequacy and financial soundness
requirements, customer protection requirements and conduct of business rules. The JFSA is empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or revocation of
registrations and licenses granted under the FIEL.

In Australia, BlackRock’s subsidiaries are subject to various Australian federal and
state laws and certain subsidiaries are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (the “ASIC”) and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (the “APRA”). The ASIC regulates companies and financial
services in Australia and is responsible for promoting investor, creditor and consumer protection. The APRA is the prudential regulator of the Australian financial services industry and oversees banks, credit unions, building societies, general
insurance and reinsurance companies, life insurance, friendly societies and most members of the superannuation (pension) industry. Failure to comply with applicable law and regulations could result in the cancellation, suspension or variation of the
regulated subsidiaries licenses in Australia.

The activities of certain BlackRock subsidiaries in Hong Kong are subject to the Securities and
Futures Ordinance (the “SFO”) which governs the securities and futures markets and regulates, among others, offers of investments to the public and provides for the licensing of intermediaries. The SFO is administered by the Securities and
Futures Commission (the “SFC”). The SFC is also empowered under the SFO to establish standards for compliance as well as codes and guidelines. The relevant BlackRock subsidiaries and the employees conducting any of the regulated activities
specified in the SFO are required to be licensed with the SFC, and are subject to the rules, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC from time to time. Failure to comply with the applicable laws, regulations, codes and guidelines issued by the SFC
could result in the suspension or revocations of the licenses granted by the SFC.

There are parallel legal and regulatory arrangements in
force in many other non-U.S. jurisdictions where BlackRock’s subsidiaries are authorized to conduct business.
