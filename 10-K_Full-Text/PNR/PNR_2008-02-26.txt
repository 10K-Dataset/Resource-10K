Customers

Our Water Group distributes its products through wholesale
    distributors, retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. Information regarding
    significant customers in our Water Group is contained in
    ITEM 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sale “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.



Competition

Our Water Group faces numerous domestic and international
    competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources.
    Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are continuing
    trends in the water industry. Competition in commercial and
    residential flow technologies markets focuses on brand names,
    product performance, quality, and price. While home center and
    national retailers are important for residential lines of water
    and wastewater pumps, they are much less important for
    commercial pumps. For municipal pumps, competition focuses on
    performance to meet required specifications, service, and price.
    Competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses
    on product performance and design, quality, delivery, and price.
    For pool and spa equipment, competition focuses on brand names,
    product performance, quality, and price. We compete by offering
    a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which
    are competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels
    and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing
    industry penetration.

TECHNICAL
    PRODUCTS GROUP

Our Technical Products Group is a leader in the global
    enclosures and thermal management markets, designing and
    manufacturing standard, modified, and custom enclosures that
    house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical
    components; thermal management products; and accessories. We
    have identified a target market of $30 billion. Our
    Technical Products Group focuses its business portfolio on four
    primary industries: Commercial and Industrial (55% of group
    sales), Telecom and Datacom (20% of group sales), Electronics
    (20% of group sales), and Networking (5% of group sales). The
    primary brand names for the Technical Products Group are:

    Products and related accessories of the Technical Products Group

    subracks, backplanes, heat exchangers, and blowers. Applications
    served include industrial machinery, data communications,
    networking, telecommunications, test and measurement,
    automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics.

Customers

Our Technical Products Group distributes its products through
    electrical and data contractors, electrical and electronic
    components distributors, and original equipment manufacturers.
    Information regarding significant customers in our Technical
    Products Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 14 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our Technical Products Group is not significantly impacted by
    seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the technical products markets can be intense,
    particularly in telecom and datacom markets, where product
    design, prototyping, global supply, price competition, and
    customer service are significant factors. Our Technical Products
    Group has continued to focus on cost control and improving
    profitability. Recent growth in the Technical Products Group is
    a result of new products development, overall market growth,
    continued channel penetration, growth in targeted market
    segments, geographic expansion and acquisitions. Consolidation,
    globalization, and outsourcing are visible trends in the
    technical products marketplace and typically play to the
    strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier. We
    believe our Technical Products Group has the broadest array of
    enclosures products available for commercial and industrial uses.

RECENT
    DEVELOPMENTS

Growth
    of our business

We continually look at each of our businesses to determine
    whether they fit with our strategic vision. Our primary focus is
    on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities,
    especially in international markets. We seek growth through
    product and service innovation, market expansion, and
    acquisitions. Acquisitions have played an important part in the
    growth of our business, and we expect acquisitions will continue
    to be an important part of our future growth.



Acquisitions

On May 7, 2007, we acquired as part of our Technical
    Products Group the assets of Calmark Corporation
    (“Calmark”), a privately held business, for
    $28.5 million, including a cash payment of
    $29.3 million and transaction costs of $0.2 million,
    less cash acquired of $1.0 million. Calmark’s results
    of operations have been included in our consolidated financial
    statements since the date of acquisition. Calmark’s product
    portfolio includes enclosures, guides, card locks, retainers,
    extractors, card pullers and other products for the aerospace,
    medical, telecommunications and military market segments, among
    others. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price
    allocation was $11.8 million, all of which is tax
    deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of
    the acquisition were $14.0 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as non-compete agreements,
    customer relationships and proprietary technology of
    $10.5 million with a weighted average amortization period
    of approximately 8 years. We continue to evaluate the
    purchase price allocation for the Calmark acquisition, including
    intangible assets, contingent liabilities and property, plant
    and equipment. We expect to revise the purchase price allocation
    as better information becomes available.

On April 30, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all of the capital interests in Porous Media Corporation and
    Porous Media, Ltd. (together, “Porous Media”), two
    privately held filtration and separation technologies
    businesses, for $224.9 million, including a cash payment of
    $225.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million,
    less cash acquired of $0.5 million. Porous Media’s
    results of operations have been included in our consolidated
    financial statements since the date of acquisition. Porous Media
    brings strong technical ability to our Water Group, including
    engineering, material science, media development and application

    for the general industrial, petrochemical, refining and
    healthcare market segments, among others. Goodwill recorded as
    part of the purchase price allocation was $128.1 million,
    all of which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets
    acquired as part of the acquisition were $73.8 million,
    including definite-lived intangibles, such as proprietary
    technology and customer relationships of $60.6 million with
    a weighted average amortization period of approximately
    11 years. We continue to evaluate the purchase price
    allocation for the Porous Media acquisition, including
    intangible assets, contingent liabilities and property, plant
    and equipment. We expect to revise the purchase price allocation
    as better information becomes available.

On February 2, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jung Pumpen GmbH
    (“Jung Pump”) for $229.5 million, including a
    cash payment of $239.6 million and transaction costs of
    $1.3 million, less cash acquired of $11.4 million.
    Jung Pump’s results of operations have been included in our
    consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
    Jung Pump is a leading German manufacturer of wastewater
    products for municipal and residential markets. Jung Pump brings
    us its strong application engineering expertise and a
    complementary product offering, including a new line of water
    re-use products, submersible wastewater and drainage pumps,
    wastewater disposal units and tanks. Jung Pump also brings to
    Pentair its well-established European presence, a
    state-of-the-art training facility in Germany and sales offices
    in Germany, Austria, France, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.
    Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was
    $123.4 million, of which approximately $53 million is
    tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part
    of the acquisition were $135.7 million, including

On April 12, 2006, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    the assets of Geyer’s Manufacturing & Design Inc.
    and FTA Filtration, Inc. (together “Krystil Klear”),
    two privately-held companies, for $15.5 million in cash.
    Krystil Klear’s results of operations have been included in
    our consolidated financial statements since the date of
    acquisition. Krystil Klear expands our industrial filtration

    all of which is tax deductible.

During 2006, we completed several other small acquisitions
    totaling $14.2 million in cash and notes payable, adding to
    both our Water and Technical Products Groups. Total goodwill
    recorded as part of the purchase price allocations was
    $9.3 million, of which $3.1 million is tax deductible.



On December 1, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Technical
    Products Group, the McLean Thermal Management, Aspen Motion
    Technologies, and Electronic Solutions businesses from APW, Ltd.
    (collectively, “Thermal”) for $143.9 million,
    including a cash payment of $140.6 million and transaction

    Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 2 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Discontinued
    operations/divestitures

In February 2008, consistent with our strategy to refine our
    portfolio and more fully focus on our growing core pool
    equipment business globally, we agreed to sell our National Pool
    Tile business unit to Pool Corporation in a cash transaction.
    National Pool Tile is the leading wholesale distributor of pool
    tile and composite pool finishes serving professional
    contractors in the swimming pool refurbish and construction
    markets. NPT has annual net sales of over $60 million, with
    the majority of its sales in the refurbish market. The business
    sale and first quarter results will be treated as discontinued
    operations. The transaction is subject to customary closing
    conditions and is targeted to close by the end of the first
    quarter 2008.

Effective after the close of business on October 2, 2004,
    we completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”). In
    January 2006, pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of
    our former Tools Group, we completed the repurchase of a
    manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China from BDK for
    approximately $5.7 million. We recorded no gain or loss on
    the repurchase. In March 2006, we completed an outstanding net
    asset value arbitration with BDK relating to the purchase price
    for the sale of our former Tools Group. The decision by the
    arbitrator constituted a final resolution of all disputes
    between BDK and us regarding the net asset value. We paid the
    final net asset value purchase price adjustment pursuant to the
    purchase agreement of $16.1 million plus interest of
    $1.1 million in March 2006, resulting in an incremental
    pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of
    $3.4 million, or $1.6 million net of tax. In the third
    quarter of 2006, we resolved a prior year tax item that resulted
    in a $1.4 million income tax benefit related to our former
    Tools Group.

In 2001, we completed the sale of our former Service Equipment
    businesses (Century Mfg. Co. /Lincoln Automotive Company) to
    Clore Automotive, LLC. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we
    reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of
    $2.9 million related to exiting the remaining two
    facilities. In March 2006, we exited a leased facility from our
    former Service Equipment business resulting in a net cash
    outflow of $2.2 million and an immaterial gain from
    disposition.

%

The $68.7 million increase in Water Group backlog was
    primarily due to increased backlog for pumps used in municipal
    market applications and growth in Asian markets. The
    $24.7 million increase in Technical Products Group backlog
    reflected growth in our electrical markets, recovery in North
    American Electronics markets and growth in Asian markets. Due to
    the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry
    practice for the majority of our businesses, backlog, which
    typically represents less than 30 days of shipments, is not
    deemed to be a significant item. A substantial portion of our
    revenues result from orders received and product sold in the
    same month. We expect that most of our backlog at
    December 31, 2007 will be filled in 2008.

Research
    and development

We conduct research and development activities in our own
    facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new
    products, product applications, and manufacturing processes.
    Research and development expenditures during 2007, 2006, and
    2005 were $58.8 million, $58.1 million, and
    $46.0 million, respectively.

    electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies),
    and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of
    raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution
    through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are
    purchased on the open market, and the majority are available
    through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not
    experienced any significant work stoppages to-date due to
    shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments,
    principally price commitments, for the purchase of various
    component parts and raw materials and believe that it is
    unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated
    prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices
    are available for most materials for which long-term commitments
    exist, and we believe that the termination of any of these
    commitments would not have a material adverse effect on
    operations.

Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to
    market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these
    fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term
    agreements with escalator / de-escalator clauses.
    Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may
    continue to trend higher in the future.

Intellectual
    property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. However, we do not regard
    our business as being materially dependent upon any single
    patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer
    relationship, trade mark, trade name, or brand name.

Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire
    or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with
    their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of
    patents, patent applications, and license agreements to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.



Employees

As of December 31, 2007, we employed approximately
    16,000 people worldwide. Total employees in the United
    States were approximately 9,300, of whom approximately 900 are
    represented by five different trade unions having collective
    bargaining agreements. Generally, labor relations have been
    satisfactory.

Captive
    Insurance Subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by
    third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired
    businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain foreign
    operations are established without regard to the availability of
    insurance.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and
    warnings before making an investment decision. If any of the
    risks described below actually occur, our business, financial
    condition, results of operations or prospects could be
    materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our
    securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your
    investment. You should also refer to other information set forth
    in this document.

General
    economic conditions, including credit and residential
    construction markets, affect demand for our
    products.

We compete globally in varied markets. Among these, the most
    significant are North American industrial and commercial markets
    (for both the Water and Technical Products Groups) and the North
    American residential market (for the Water Group). Economic
    conditions in the United States affect the robustness of our
    North American markets. Important factors include the overall
    strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in
    the economy; industrial and municipal capital spending; the
    strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets;
    the age of existing housing stock; unemployment rates;
    availability of consumer and commercial financing; and interest
    rates. New construction for residential housing and home
    improvement activity fell dramatically in 2007, which reduced
    revenue growth in our Water Group, especially in the pool and
    spa and flow technologies markets we address. We believe that
    recent weaknesses in these markets will likely continue to
    affect our revenues and margins throughout 2008. Further, while
    we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market
    fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and
    geographic regions, we cannot assure you that a significant or
    sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region
    would not have a material adverse effect on us.

Our
    businesses operate in highly competitive markets, so we may be
    forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs.

Our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of
    their respective markets. Competition may force us to cut prices
    or to incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete
    on the basis of product design, quality, availability,
    performance, customer service and price. Present or future
    competitors may have



greater financial, technical or other resources which could put
    us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses. We
    cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a
    material adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Our
    inability to sustain consistent organic growth could adversely
    affect our financial performance.

In 2007 and 2006, our organic growth was generated in part from
    expanding international sales, entering new distribution
    channels, price increases and introducing new products. To grow
    more rapidly than our end markets, we will have to continue to
    expand our geographic reach, further diversify our distribution
    channels, continue to introduce new products, and increase sales
    of existing products to our customer base. Competitive and
    economic factors could adversely affect our ability to sustain
    consistent organic growth. If we are unable to sustain
    consistent organic growth, we will be less likely to meet our
    stated revenue growth targets, which together with any resulting
    impact on our net income growth, would likely adversely affect
    the market price of our stock.

Our
    inability to complete, or successfully complete and integrate,
    acquisitions could adversely affect our financial
    performance.

Over the past three years, we have grown through acquisitions of
    businesses within our current business segments, that have
    generated a significant percentage of our net revenue growth. We
    may not be able to sustain this level of growth from acquisition
    activity in the future. We intend to continue to evaluate
    strategic acquisitions primarily in our current business
    segments, though we may consider acquisitions outside of these
    segments as well. Our ability to expand through acquisitions is
    subject to various risks, including the following:

•

higher acquisition prices;

•

lack of suitable acquisition candidates in targeted product or
    market areas;

•

increased competition for acquisitions, especially in the water
    industry;

•

diversion of management time and attention to acquisitions and
    acquired businesses;

•

inability to integrate acquired businesses effectively or
    profitably; and

•

inability to achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits
    from acquisitions.

Acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our
    operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters
    immediately following the acquisitions, while we attempt to
    integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our
    operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve
    the levels of profitability originally anticipated.

Material
    cost and other inflation could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

We are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a
    number of our businesses. We are striving for greater
    productivity improvements and implementing selective increases
    in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw
    materials, especially metals, energy and other costs such as
    pension, health care and insurance. We also are continuing to
    implement our excellence in operations initiatives in order to
    continuously reduce our costs. We cannot assure you, however,
    that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or
    increasing our productivity. Continued cost inflation or failure
    of our initiatives to generate cost savings or improve
    productivity would likely negatively impact our results of
    operations.

Seasonality
    of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our
    financial results.

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water



systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly by
    heavy flooding and droughts. We cannot assure you that
    seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Intellectual
    property challenges may hinder product development and
    marketing.

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. Intellectual property
    protection, however, may not preclude competitors from
    developing products similar to ours or from challenging our
    names or products. Over the past few years, we have noticed an
    increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use
    conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a
    means to compete. Patent and trademark challenges increase our
    costs to develop, engineer and market our products.

Our
    results of operations may be negatively impacted by
    litigation.

Our business exposes us to potential litigation, especially
    product liability suits that are inherent in the design,
    manufacture, and sale of our products, such as the Horizon
    litigation discussed in ITEM 3 and Item 8,
    Note 15 of this Annual Report on

Form 10-K.

While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable
    product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will
    be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that
    this insurance will provide adequate protection against
    potential liabilities. In addition, we self-insure a portion of
    product liability claims. A series of successful claims against
    us could materially and adversely affect our product reputation,
    financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The
    availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on
    our continued growth.

Our plans to continue growth in our chosen markets will require
    additional capital for future acquisitions, capital expenditures
    for existing businesses, growth of working capital, and
    continued international and regional expansion. In the past, we
    have financed our growth primarily through debt financing. While
    we refinanced our primary credit agreements in the second
    quarter of 2007, future acquisitions may require us to expand
    our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities. Our
    financial results may be adversely affected if interest costs
    under our debt financings are higher than the income generated
    by acquisitions or other internal growth. In addition, future
    acquisitions could be dilutive to your equity investment if we
    issue additional stock as consideration. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to issue equity securities or to
    obtain future debt financing at favorable terms. Without
    sufficient financing, we will not be able to pursue our growth
    strategy, especially our acquisition program, which will limit
    our growth and revenues in the future.

Our
    international operations are subject to foreign market and
    currency fluctuation risks.

We expect the percentage of our sales outside of North America
    to increase in the future. Over the past few years, the
    economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do
    business have had slower growth than the U.S. economy. The
    European Union currently accounts for the majority of our
    foreign sales and income, in which our most significant European
    market is Germany. In addition, we have a significant and
    growing business in the Asia-Pacific area. We cannot predict how
    changing market conditions in these regions will impact our
    financial results.

We are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign
    currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results.
    In 2007, the weakness of the US dollar benefited our financial
    results in foreign jurisdictions significantly. We do not
    anticipate continuing US dollar weakness in foreign exchange
    markets in 2008 of a similar magnitude, which may hurt our
    financial results on a comparative basis. In addition, we source
    certain products, components and raw materials throughout the
    world, the import of which into the United States has raised the
    cost of these goods in US dollars and has impacted the results
    of our domestic businesses as well. We expect a continuing
    impact of the weak dollar in 2008, as well, although we expect
    that we should be able to offset this continuing impact through
    increased focus on our sourcing programs, productivity gains in
    our facilities and other cost reductions.



We are
    exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from
    operating a multinational business.

Sales outside of the United States, including export sales from
    our domestic businesses, accounted for approximately 32% of our
    net sales in 2007, up from 27% in 2006. Further, most of our
    businesses obtain some products, components and raw materials
    from foreign suppliers. Accordingly, our business is subject to
    the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in
    operating in numerous countries. These risks include:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing
    requirements;

•

tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the
    U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on
    foreign earnings;

•

the possibility of terrorist action against us or our operations;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other
    restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in

non-U.S. labor

markets;

•

the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in foreign
    countries;

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations; and

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in
    countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

Our business success depends in part on our ability to
    anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We
    cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a
    material adverse effect on our international operations or on
    our business as a whole.

We are
    exposed to potential environmental and other laws, liabilities
    and litigation.

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
    regulations governing our environmental practices, public and
    worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment.
    Compliance with environmental regulations could require us to
    satisfy environmental liabilities, increase the cost of
    manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. Any
    violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur
    unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results
    and cause our business to suffer. We are also required to comply
    with various environmental laws and maintain permits, some of
    which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time,
    for many of our businesses, and we could suffer if we are unable
    to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits
    that we may require.

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a number of
    environmental

clean-ups

relating to our current or former business units. We have
    disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and, in
    certain cases, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers. We
    may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing
    business units, as well as both divested and acquired businesses.

We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change
    or become more stringent over time or that our eventual
    environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Provisions
    of our Restated Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Minnesota
    law could deter takeover attempts.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under
    Minnesota law, and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent
    or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.



Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include
    provisions relating to the election, appointment and removal of
    directors, as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting
    requirements which could delay, prevent or make more difficult a
    merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control.
    In addition, our common share purchase rights could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us, which could deter some acquirers from making
    takeover proposals or tender offers. Also, the Minnesota
    Business Corporations Act contains control share acquisition and
    business combination provisions which could delay, prevent or
    make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
    other change of control. Our shareholders might view any such
    transaction as being in their best interests since the
    transaction could result in a higher stock price than the
    current market price for our common stock.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is in leased premises located in
    Golden Valley, Minnesota. We carry out our Water Group
    manufacturing operations at 19 plants located throughout the
    United States and at 18 plants located in 10 other countries. In
    addition, our Water Group has 65 distribution facilities and 18
    sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the
    world. We carry out our Technical Products Group manufacturing
    operations at 8 plants located throughout the United States and
    11 plants located in 7 other countries. In addition, our
    Technical Products Group has 11 distribution facilities and 29
    sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their
    purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal
    Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims



have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $3.5 million and
    $5.6 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a
    liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the
    claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing
    information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as
    additional information becomes available. We have not
    experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the
    severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal
    injury claims.

Horizon
    litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs,
    a class action and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise
    Lines, Inc. (“Celebrity”) were brought against Essef
    Corporation (“Essef”) and certain of its subsidiaries
    prior to our acquisition of Essef in August 1999. The claims
    against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the
    allegation that Essef designed, manufactured and marketed two
    sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the
    spa system on the Horizon cruise ship and allegations that the
    spa and filters contained Legionnaire’s disease bacteria
    that infected certain passengers on cruises in July 1994.

The individual and class claims by passengers were tried and
    resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the
    part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister
    company, Fantasia (together 30%). After expiration of post-trial
    appeals, we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of
    $7.0 million in the passenger cases, plus interest of
    approximately $1.6 million, in January 2004. All of the
    passenger cases have now been resolved through either settlement
    or judgment.

The only remaining unresolved claims in this case were those
    brought by Celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak.
    Celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and
    costs for prior litigation as well as out-of-pocket losses, lost
    profits and loss of business enterprise value. The first trial
    in 2006 resulted in a verdict against the Essef defendants for
    Celebrity’s out-of-pocket expenses of $10.4 million.
    Verdicts at this trial for lost profits ($47.6 million) and
    lost enterprise value ($135 million) were reversed in
    January 2007. In the retrial in June 2007, the jury awarded
    Celebrity damages for lost profits for 1994 and 1995 of
    $15.2 million



(after netting for amounts taken into account by the earlier
    verdict for out-of-pocket expenses). The verdicts are exclusive
    of pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees.

In January 2008, the District Court ruled on post-trial motions
    and other previously undecided issues in this litigation. Our
    motion to reverse the jury verdict in the second trial on lost
    profits after 1994 was not granted; Celebrity’s damages for
    out-of-pocket costs and lost profits were reduced by 30%
    reflecting an earlier finding of its contributory negligence;
    and pre-judgment interest was awarded to Celebrity at a rate
    equal to semiannual T-Bill rates compounded annually. In
    addition, Celebrity and the Essef defendants settled
    Celebrity’s claim for attorneys’ fees in the passenger
    cases for $3 million, inclusive of all interest. This
    amount was paid and expensed in the fourth quarter of 2007.

In the aggregate, damages against the Essef defendants in this
    litigation total approximately $30.5 million, inclusive of
    interest through 2007. Judgment on the verdicts has not yet been
    entered. Once entered, both parties will have thirty days in
    which to appeal from the judgment. The Essef defendants have not
    yet determined whether and on what issues they may appeal in
    this case.

We have assessed the impact of the latest ruling on our
    previously established reserves for this matter and, based on
    information available at this time, have not changed our
    reserves, except to take into account appropriate interest
    accruals.

We believe that any judgment we pay in this matter would be
    tax-deductible in the year paid or in subsequent years. In
    addition to the impact of any loss on this matter on our
    earnings per share when recognized, we may need to borrow funds
    from our banks or other sources to pay any judgment, plus
    interest, upon settlement or finally determined after exhaustion
    of all appeals.

    Report on

is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A
    or 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to the
    liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of

    into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent we
    specifically incorporate it by reference into such a filing.

The following graph sets forth the cumulative total shareholder
    return on our common stock for the last five years, assuming the
    investment of $100 on December 31, 2002 and the
    reinvestment of all dividends since that date to
    December 31, 2007. The graph also contains for comparison
    purposes the S&P 500 Index and the S&P MidCap 400
    Index, assuming the same investment level and reinvestment of
    dividends.

By virtue of our market capitalization, we are a component of
    the S&P MidCap 400 Index. On the basis of our size and
    diversity of businesses, we have not found a readily
    identifiable peer group. We believe the S&P MidCap 400
    Index is an appropriate comparison. We have evaluated other
    published indices, but have determined that the results are
    skewed by significantly larger companies included in the
    indices. We believe such a comparison would not be meaningful.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S
    DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
    OPERATIONS

This report contains statements that we believe to be
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or
    forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements generally

    “project,” or “continue,” or the negative
    thereof or similar words. From time to time, we also may provide
    oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials we
    release to the public. Any or all of our forward-looking
    statements in this report and in any public statements we make
    could be materially different from actual results. They can be
    affected by assumptions we might make or by known or unknown
    risks or uncertainties. Consequently, we cannot guarantee any
    forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to place
    undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Investors
    should also understand that it is not possible to predict or
    identify all such factors and should not consider the following
    list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and
    uncertainties.

The following factors and those discussed in ITEM 1A, Risk
    Factors, of this

Form 10-K

may impact the achievement of forward-looking statements:

•

changes in general economic and industry conditions, such as:

•

the strength of product demand and the markets we serve;

•

the intensity of competition, including that from foreign
    competitors;

•

pricing pressures;

•

market acceptance of new product introductions and enhancements;

•

the introduction of new products and enhancements by competitors;

•

our ability to maintain and expand relationships with large
    customers;

•

our ability to source raw material commodities from our
    suppliers without interruption and at reasonable prices;

•

our ability to source components from third parties, in
    particular from foreign manufacturers, without interruption and
    at reasonable prices; and

•

the financial condition of our customers;

•

our ability to access capital markets and obtain anticipated
    financing under favorable terms;

•

our ability to successfully limit any final judgment arising out
    of the Horizon litigation;

•

our ability to identify, complete and integrate acquisitions
    successfully and to realize expected synergies on our
    anticipated timetable;

•

changes in our business strategies, including acquisition,
    divestiture and restructuring activities;

•

domestic and foreign governmental and regulatory policies;

•

general economic and political conditions, such as political
    instability, the rate of economic growth in our principal
    geographic or product markets or fluctuations in exchange rates;

•

changes in operating factors, such as continued improvement in
    manufacturing activities and the achievement of related
    efficiencies, cost reductions and inventory risks due to shifts
    in market demand and costs associated with moving production
    overseas;

•

our ability to generate savings from our excellence in
    operations initiatives consisting of lean enterprise, supply
    management and cash flow practices;



•

unanticipated developments that could occur with respect to
    contingencies such as litigation, intellectual property matters,
    product liability exposures and environmental matters; and

•

our ability to accurately evaluate the effects of contingent
    liabilities such as tax, product liability, environmental and
    other claims.

The foregoing factors are not exhaustive, and new factors may
    emerge or changes to the foregoing factors may occur that would
    impact our business. We assume no obligation, and disclaim any
    duty, to update the forward-looking statements in this report.

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company
    comprised of two operating segments: Water and Technical
    Products. Our Water Group is a global leader in providing
    innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement,
    storage, treatment and enjoyment of water. Our Technical
    Products Group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal
    management markets, designing and manufacturing standard,
    modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive
    electronics and electrical components; thermal management
    products; and accessories. In 2008, we expect our Water Group
    and Technical Products Group to generate approximately 70% and
    30% of total revenues, respectively.

Our Water Group has progressively become a more important part
    of our business portfolio with sales increasing from
    approximately $125 million in 1995 to approximately
    $2.3 billion in 2007. We believe the water industry is
    structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for
    clean water and the large global market size (of which we have
    identified a target market totaling $60 billion). Our
    vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products
    and systems used in the movement, storage, treatment and
    enjoyment of water.

Our Technical Products Group operates in a large global market
    with significant potential for growth in industry segments such
    as defense, security, medical and networking. We believe we have
    the largest enclosures industrial and commercial distribution
    network in North America and the highest enclosures brand
    recognition in the industry in North America. From mid-2001
    through 2003, the Technical Products Group experienced
    significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely
    reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial
    markets and over-capacity and weak demand in the
    datacommunication and telecommunication markets. From 2004
    through 2007, sales volumes increased due to the addition of new
    distributors, new products and higher demand in targeted markets.

Key
    Trends and Uncertainties

The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial
    performance in 2007 and will likely impact our results in the
    future:

•

The housing market and new pool starts slowed in the last three
    quarters of 2006 and continued to shrink in 2007. We believe
    that construction of new homes and new pools starts in North
    America affects approximately 12% of our sales, especially for
    our pool and spa businesses. This downturn will likely have an
    adverse impact on our revenues for 2008.

•

The telecommunication equipment market, particularly in North
    America, has slowed over the past year and a half and impacted
    North American electronics sales within our Technical Products
    Group. For the full year 2007, North American electronics sales
    declined approximately 15% when compared with 2006. The revenue
    decrease was attributable to telecommunication industry
    consolidation (which has delayed enclosure product sales) and
    some OEM datacommunication programs reaching end-of-life. Based
    on some recovery of telecommunications equipment procurement in
    the second half of 2007, we anticipate continuing improvement in
    2008 and growth rates in the low double digits for our North
    American electronics sales. A weak economy in the United States
    and Europe could reduce the telecommunications capital
    investments and therefore our anticipated revenue growth.

•

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of



the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance
    sale “early buy” programs (generally including
    extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and
    weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts.

•

We expect our operations to continue to benefit from our PIMS
    initiatives, which include strategy deployment; lean enterprise
    with special focus on sourcing and supply management, cash flow
    management and lean operations; and IGNITE, our process to drive
    organic growth.

•

We are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a
    number of our businesses. We are striving for greater
    productivity improvements and implementing selective increases
    in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases we have
    experienced in base materials such as stainless steel, carbon
    steel and copper and other costs such as health care and other
    employee benefit costs.

•

If sales of products into residential end-markets in our Water
    business continue to slow appreciably, we may consider reducing
    our investments and consequentially organic growth in those
    markets and further restructure our operations by closing or
    downsizing facilities, reducing headcount or taking other
    market-related actions as we did in 2006 and 2007.

•

We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of our net income. We
    define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities
    less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of property
    and equipment. Free cash flow for the full year 2007 was
    approximately $285 million, or 135% of our net income. See
    our discussion of

Other financial measures

under the
    caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this
    report.

•

We experienced favorable foreign currency effects on net sales
    in 2007. Our currency effect is primarily for the
    U.S. dollar against the euro, which may or may not trend
    favorably in the future.

•

The effective tax rate for 2007 was 30.7%. The tax rate for 2007
    includes a favorable adjustment related to the measurement of
    deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for changes in
    German tax law enacted on August 17, 2007. We estimate our
    effective income tax rate for the full year 2008 to be between
    33.5% and 34.5%. We continue to actively pursue initiatives to
    reduce our effective tax rate. The tax rate in any quarter can
    be affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are
    required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution.

Outlook

In 2008, our operating objectives include the following:

•

Continue to drive operating excellence through lean enterprise
    initiatives, with special focus on sourcing and supply
    management, cash flow management, and lean operations;

•

Continue the integration of acquisitions and realize identified
    synergistic opportunities;

•

Continue proactive talent development, particularly in
    international management and other key functional areas;

•

Achieve organic sales growth (in excess of market growth rates),
    particularly in international markets; and

•

Continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our
    existing platforms in our Water and Technical Products Groups.

On February 5, 2008, we reaffirmed our previously issued
    fiscal 2008 guidance, which anticipates our earnings per share
    growth between 8% and 15% to approximately $2.25 to $2.40 per
    share. Our estimate is based on three primary variables. First,
    we anticipate modest organic growth in the range of 3% to 5%,
    including some price and product mix improvements, bringing our
    total revenues to $3.5 to $3.6 billion for the full year.
    Second, we anticipate that our manufacturing productivity
    initiatives, in particular our materials sourcing programs, will
    improve through our lean enterprise initiatives and through
    somewhat higher unit volumes. Third, we anticipate our selling,
    marketing and R&D expenses will flex with economic
    conditions in our primary markets.



If economic conditions worsen in North America and Europe, then
    we expect that our sales and productivity increases may
    deteriorate from current forecast. In that event, we would
    reduce discretionary selling, marketing and R&D costs in
    order to minimize the impact of these declines on our earnings
    per share, which we anticipate would still meet the bottom of
    our guidance range. Conversely, if economic conditions hold up
    and improve over the year, we expect our net income should be
    able to reach the top of our guidance range. We would then have
    the flexibility to increase expenditures in our selling,
    marketing and R&D efforts to maximize organic sales growth
    in 2008 and sustain anticipated growth in 2009.

We based our guidance on an absence of significant acquisitions
    or divestitures in 2008. As noted above, in 2008 our objectives
    may seek to expand our geographic reach internationally, expand
    our presence in our various channels to market and acquire
    technologies and products to broaden our businesses’
    capabilities to serve additional markets. We may also consider
    the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our
    businesses on their most attractive markets.

The ability to achieve our operating objectives and 2008
    guidance will depend, to a certain extent, on factors outside
    our control. See “Risk Factors” under Part I of
    this report.

The
    7.7 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2007 from
    2006 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume due to our February 2, 2007
    acquisition of Jung Pumpen GmbH (“Jung Pump”) and our
    April 30, 2007 acquisition of Porous Media Corporation and
    Porous Media, Ltd. (together “Porous Media”);

•

organic sales growth of approximately 2 percent for the
    full year 2007 (excluding acquisitions and foreign currency
    exchange), which included selective increases in selling prices
    to mitigate inflationary cost increases:

•

growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific markets;

•

higher Technical Product sales into electrical markets;

•

higher second quarter sales of municipal pumps related to a
    large flood control project; and

•

growth in commercial and industrial water markets.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower Technical Products sales into North American electronics
    markets driven by contraction and consolidation in the
    telecommunication equipment industry which have delayed buying
    activity and by datacommunication projects reaching
    end-of-life; and

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    related to the downturn in the North American residential
    housing market and softness in residential pool construction
    markets; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.



The
    7.1 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2006 from
    2005 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume due to our acquisitions, primarily
    the December 1, 2005 acquisition of the McLean Thermal
    Management, Aspen Motion Technologies, and Electronic Solutions
    businesses from APW, Ltd. (collectively,
    “Thermal”); and

•

organic sales growth of approximately two percent (excluding the
    effects of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange), which
    includes selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases.

Water

The
    9.0 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2007 from
    2006 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our February 2, 2007
    acquisition of Jung Pump and our April 30, 2007 acquisition
    of Porous Media;

•

organic sales were up 2 percent for the full year 2007
    (excluding acquisitions and foreign currency exchange), which
    included selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases:

•

continued growth in China and in other markets in Asia-Pacific
    as well as continued success in penetrating markets in Europe
    and the Middle East;

•

higher second quarter sales of municipal pumps related to a
    large flood control project; and

•

growth in commercial and industrial water markets.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

a decline in sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    into North American residential markets and softness in
    residential pool construction markets; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The
    1.1 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2006 from
    2005 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales growth of approximately one percent (excluding
    foreign currency exchange), which includes selective increases
    in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

strong pump sales in our commercial markets;

•

increased sales in Europe driven by higher pump and filtration
    sales;

•

sales growth in emerging markets in Asia-Pacific;

•

sales growth of filtration products in our foodservice,
    commercial, and industrial markets; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales of pool and spa products due to softening of the
    U.S. residential housing market and inventory draw-downs by
    pool distribution customers to position themselves for the
    softening market.



Technical
    Products

The
    5.1 percent increase in Technical Products segment sales in
    2007 from 2006 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales which were up approximately 2 percent for the
    full year 2007 (excluding acquisitions and foreign currency
    exchange), which included selective increases in selling prices
    to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

strong sales performance in Asia; and

•

increased sales into electrical markets.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales into North American electronics markets driven by
    contraction and consolidation in the telecommunication equipment
    industry which have delayed buying activity and by
    datacommunication projects reaching end-of-life; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The
    22.6 percent increase in Technical Products segment sales
    in 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume due to our December 1, 2005
    acquisition of the Thermal businesses;

•

organic sales growth of approximately six percent (excluding
    acquisitions and foreign currency exchange), which includes
    selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases:

•

increased sales in our commercial and industrial markets;

•

increased sales in European test and measurement and telecom
    markets;

•

higher sales in Asia driven by key OEM programs in China and
    stronger sales in the telecom and semiconductor markets in
    Japan; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales to North American telecom businesses due to weaker
    markets conditions, customer consolidation and certain key
    projects reaching end-of-life; and

•

lower sales in data markets related to OEM projects that reached
    end-of-life or were transitioned to our Asian operations.

    of:

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and
    supply management practices;

•

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases; and

•

a decrease in costs related to capacity rationalization and
    market-related actions in 2007 compared to 2006.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

inflationary increases related to raw materials and
    labor; and



•

higher cost as a result of a fair market value inventory

step-up

related to the Jung Pump and Porous Media acquisitions.

The
    0.1 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percent
    of sales in 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result
    of:

•

inflationary increases related to material, labor and freight
    costs;

•

increased reserves for inventory and warranty expenses in our
    Water Group due to the effects of the U.S. residential
    housing market downturn on the spa and bath markets and new pool
    starts, and also due to inventory reserves established for pump
    motors that we no longer expect to need;

•

lower sales of pool and spa products related to the
    U.S. residential housing market downturn; and

•

operating inefficiencies related to product moves and plant
    consolidations.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and
    supply management practices;

•

cost leverage from increased sales volume in our Technical
    Products Group; and

    of:

•

higher selling and general expense to fund investments in future
    growth with emphasis on growth in the international markets,
    including personnel and business infrastructure investments;

•

proportionately higher SG&A expenses in the acquired Jung
    Pump and Porous Media businesses caused in part by amortization
    expense related to the intangible assets from those
    acquisitions; and

•

exit costs incurred in 2007 related to a previously announced
    2001 French facility closure.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

a decrease in costs related to capacity rationalization and
    market-related actions in 2007 compared to 2006.

The
    0.9 percentage point increase in SG&A expense as a
    percent of sales in 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result
    of:

•

higher selling, general and administrative expense to fund
    investments in future growth in our Water Group, including
    personnel and business infrastructure, with an emphasis on
    growth in our international markets; and

•

severance costs in our Water Group and at our corporate
    headquarters, and increased reserves for accounts receivable due
    to the effects of the U.S. residential housing market
    downturn on the spa and bath markets and new pool starts in our
    Water Group.

    opportunities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures,
    equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, dividend
    payments and share repurchases are generally funded from cash
    generated from operations, availability under existing committed
    revolving credit facilities, and in certain instances, public
    and private debt and equity offerings. In 2007, we invested
    $488 million in acquisitions, repurchased $41 million
    of our stock, and paid $60 million in dividends.

We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal
    demand in a number of markets within our Water Group. End-user
    demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at
    seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales
    spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale
    “early buy” programs (generally including extended
    payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Operating
    activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $341.9 million in
    2007, or $110.3 million higher compared with the same
    period in 2006. The increase in cash provided by operating
    activities was due primarily to working capital reductions
    during 2007 versus 2006 and higher net income. In the future, we
    expect our working capital ratios to improve as we continue to
    capitalize on our PIMS initiatives.

Cash provided by operating activities was $231.6 million in
    2006, or $16.2 million lower compared with the same period
    in 2005. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities
    was due primarily to working capital increases related to
    increased inventory levels and decreases in various accruals.
    The increase in days inventory on hand as of December 31,
    2006 compared to December 31, 2005 was attributable to
    increased inventory levels to support product moves and plant
    rationalizations, inventory to support product sourced from low
    cost countries, higher value of inventories due to rising raw
    material input costs, and due to the purchase of additional
    submersible pump motors for competitive reasons.

In December 2007 and 2006, we sold approximately
    $50 million and $30 million, respectively, of accounts
    receivable to a third-party financial institution to mitigate
    accounts receivable concentration risk because we did not offer
    or the customer did not take advantage of the early pay
    discounts. In compliance with SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities,

sales of accounts
    receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable
    in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the proceeds are included
    in the cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows. In 2007 and 2006, a loss in the amount
    of $1.2 million and $0.8 million related to the sale
    of accounts receivable is included in the line
    item

Gain(loss) on sale of assets, net

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

Investing
    activities

Capital expenditures in 2007, 2006, and 2005 were
    $62.1 million, $51.1 million and $62.5 million,
    respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2008
    to be approximately $65 to $75 million, primarily for
    capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing
    facilities, new product development, and general maintenance
    capital.

On May 7, 2007, we acquired as part of our Technical
    Products Group the assets of Calmark Corporation
    (“Calmark”), a privately held business, for
    $28.5 million, including a cash payment of
    $29.3 million and transaction costs of $0.2 million,
    less cash acquired of $1.0 million. Calmark’s results
    of operations have been included in our consolidated financial
    statements since the date of acquisition. Calmark’s product
    portfolio includes enclosures, guides, card locks, retainers,
    extractors, card pullers and other products for the aerospace,
    medical, telecommunications and military market segments, among
    others. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price
    allocation was $11.8 million, all of which is tax
    deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of
    the acquisition were $14.0 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as non-compete agreements,
    customer relationships and proprietary technology of
    $10.5 million with a weighted average amortization period
    of approximately 8 years. We continue to evaluate the
    purchase price allocation for the Calmark acquisition, including
    intangible assets, contingent liabilities and property, plant
    and equipment. We expect to revise the purchase price allocation
    as better information becomes available.

On April 30, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all of the capital interests in Porous Media, two privately held
    filtration and separation technologies businesses, for
    $224.9 million, including a cash payment of
    $225.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million,
    less cash acquired of $0.5 million. Porous Media’s



results of operations have been included in our consolidated
    financial statements since the date of acquisition. Porous Media
    brings strong technical ability to our Water Group, including
    engineering, material science, media development and application
    capabilities. Porous Media’s product portfolio includes
    high-performance filter media, membranes and related filtration
    products and purification systems for liquids, gases and solids
    for the general industrial, petrochemical, refining and
    healthcare market segments, among others. Goodwill recorded as
    part of the purchase price allocation was $128.1 million,
    all of which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets
    acquired as part of the acquisition were $73.8 million,
    including definite-lived intangibles, such as proprietary
    technology and customer relationships of $60.6 million with
    a weighted average amortization period of approximately
    11 years. We continue to evaluate the purchase price
    allocation for the Porous Media acquisition, including
    intangible assets, contingent liabilities and property, plant
    and equipment. We expect to revise the purchase price allocation
    as better information becomes available.

On February 2, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jung Pump for
    $229.5 million, including a cash payment of
    $239.6 million and transaction costs of $1.3 million,
    less cash acquired of $11.4 million. Jung Pump’s
    results of operations have been included in our consolidated
    financial statements since the date of acquisition. Jung Pump is
    a leading German manufacturer of wastewater products for
    municipal and residential markets. Jung Pump brings us its
    strong application engineering expertise and a complementary
    product offering, including a new line of water re-use products,
    submersible wastewater and drainage pumps, wastewater disposal
    units and tanks. Jung Pump also brings to Pentair its
    well-established European presence, a state-of-the-art training
    facility in Germany and sales offices in Germany, Austria,
    France, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Goodwill recorded as part
    of the purchase price allocation was $123.4 million, of
    which approximately $53 million is tax deductible.
    Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the
    acquisition were $135.7 million, including definite-lived
    intangibles, primarily customer relationships of
    $71.6 million with a weighted average amortization period
    of approximately 15 years.

On April 12, 2006, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    the assets of Geyer’s Manufacturing & Design Inc.
    and FTA Filtration, Inc. (together “Krystil Klear”),
    two privately-held companies, for $15.5 million in cash.
    Krystil Klear’s results of operations have been included in
    our consolidated financial statements since the date of
    acquisition. Krystil Klear expands our industrial filtration
    product offering to include a full range of steel and stainless
    steel tanks which house filtration solutions. Goodwill recorded
    as part of the purchase price allocation was $9.2 million,
    all of which is tax deductible.

During 2006, we completed several other small acquisitions
    totaling $14.2 million in cash and notes payable, adding to
    both our Water and Technical Products Groups. Total goodwill
    recorded as part of the purchase price allocations was
    $9.3 million, of which $3.1 million is tax deductible.

Effective after the close of business on October 2, 2004,
    we completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”). In
    January 2006, pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of
    our former Tools Group, we completed the repurchase of a
    manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China from BDK for
    approximately $5.7 million. We recorded no gain or loss on
    the repurchase. In March 2006, we completed an outstanding net
    asset value arbitration with BDK relating to the purchase price
    for the sale of our former Tools Group. The decision by the
    arbitrator constituted a final resolution of all disputes
    between BDK and us regarding the net asset value. We paid the
    final net asset value purchase price adjustment pursuant to the
    purchase agreement of $16.1 million plus interest of
    $1.1 million in March 2006, resulting in an incremental
    pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of
    $3.4 million, or $1.6 million net of tax. In the third
    quarter of 2006, we resolved a prior year tax item that resulted
    in a $1.4 million income tax benefit related to our former
    Tools Group.

During 2007, we made investments in and loans to certain joint
    ventures in the amount of $5.5 million.

Cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of
    $5.2 million in 2007 was primarily related to the sale of a
    facility for our Technical Products Group. Cash proceeds from
    the sale of property and equipment of $17.1 million in 2005
    was primarily related to the sale of three facilities for our
    Water Group.



On December 1, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Technical
    Products Group, the Thermal businesses from APW, Ltd. for
    $143.9 million, including a cash payment of
    $140.6 million and transaction costs of $3.3 million.
    These businesses provide thermal management solutions and
    integration services to the telecommunications, data
    communications, medical, and security markets. Final goodwill
    recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was
    $71.1 million, all of which is tax deductible. Final
    identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the
    acquisition were $45.6 million, including definite-lived
    intangibles, such as proprietary technology and customer
    relationships, of $23.1 million with a weighted average
    amortization period of approximately 12 years.

On February 23, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Water
    Group, certain assets of Delta Environmental Products, Inc. and
    affiliates (collectively, “DEP”), a privately-held
    company, for $10.3 million, including a cash payment of
    $10.0 million, transaction costs of $0.2 million, and
    debt assumed of $0.1 million. The DEP product line
    addressees the water and wastewater markets. Final goodwill
    recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was
    $7.2 million, all of which is tax deductible.

In the third quarter 2005, we paid $10.4 million in
    post-closing purchase price adjustments related to the October
    2004 sale of our former Tools Group to BDK.

In April 2005, we sold our interest in the stock of LN Holdings
    Corporation for cash consideration of $23.6 million,
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of $5.2 million and an after
    tax gain of $3.3 million. The terms of the sale agreement
    established two escrow accounts totaling $14 million to be
    used for payment of any potential adjustments to the purchase
    price, transaction expenses, and indemnification for certain
    losses such as environmental claims. In December 2005, we
    received $0.2 million from the escrow accounts which
    increased our gain from the sale. During 2006 we received
    $1.2 million from the escrow accounts which also increased
    our gain from the sale. Any remaining escrow balances are to be
    distributed by April 2008 to the former shareholders in
    accordance with their ownership percentages. Any funds received
    from settlement of escrows in future periods will be accounted
    for as additional gain on the sale of this interest.

Financing
    activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was
    $222.7 million in 2007 versus a cash use of
    $117.8 million and $43.8 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The increase in 2007 primarily relates to the
    additional borrowings to fund the Jung Pumpen and Porous Media
    acquisitions. Financing activities consisted primarily of
    proceeds from debt issuances and draw downs and repayments on
    our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the
    normal course of business, dividend payments, share repurchases,
    cash received from stock option exercises and tax benefits
    related to stock-based compensation.

In June 2007, we entered into an amended and restated
    multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Credit
    Facility”). The Credit Facility creates an unsecured,
    committed revolving credit facility of up to $800 million,
    with multi-currency sub-facilities to support investment outside
    the U.S. The Credit Facility expires June 4, 2012.
    Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at the
    rate of LIBOR plus 0.50%. Interest rates and fees under the
    Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had $106.0 million of commercial
    paper outstanding that matures within 71 days. All of the
    commercial paper was classified as long-term as we have the
    intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a
    long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

In May 2007, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with
    various institutional investors (the “Agreement”) for
    the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our
    5.87% Senior Notes (“Fixed Notes”) and
    $105 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating
    Rate Senior Notes (“Floating Notes” and with the Fixed
    Notes, the “Notes”). The Fixed Notes are due in May
    2017. The Floating Notes are due in May 2012 and bear interest
    equal to the 3 month LIBOR plus 0.50%. The Agreement
    contains customary events of default.



We used $250 million of the proceeds from the sale of the
    Notes to retire a $250 million

364-day

Term
    Loan Agreement that we entered into in April 2007, which we used
    in part to pay the cash purchase price of our Porous Media
    acquisition which closed in April 2007.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of
    December 31, 2007.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $29.7 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had drawn
    $13.5 million in borrowings as of December 31, 2007.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

Long-Term Debt

Current Rating

Rating Agency

Rating

Outlook

Standard & Poor’s

BBB

Negative

Moody’s

Baa3

Stable

On March 7, 2007, Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services revised its current rating outlook on us from stable to
    negative. At the same time, Standard & Poor’s
    affirmed its long-term debt rating of ’BBB’.
    Standard & Poor’s stated that the outlook
    revision reflects the additional leverage and stress on credit
    metrics that would result from the acquisition of Porous Media.
    The negative outlook indicates the rating could be lowered if
    financial policies become more aggressive or if operating
    results are weaker than expected.

We believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial
    outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure
    or cost of debt. A credit rating is a current opinion of the
    creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
    financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations,
    or a specific financial program. The credit rating takes into
    consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or
    other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes
    into account the currency in which the obligation is
    denominated. The ratings outlook also highlights the potential
    direction of a short or long-term rating. It focuses on
    identifiable events and short-term trends that cause ratings to
    be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies. A
    change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is
    inevitable. Prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no
    immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of
    debt.

We issue short-term commercial paper notes that are currently
    not rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.
    Even though our short-term commercial paper is unrated, we
    believe a downgrade in our long-term debt rating could have a
    negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated
    commercial paper.

We do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long-term
    debt by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
    would substantially affect our ability to access the long term
    debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions,
    the amount, timing and pricing of new borrowings could be
    adversely affected. If both of our long-term debt ratings were
    downgraded to below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the
    term debt capital markets would be reduced.

As of December 31, 2007, our capital structure consisted of
    $1,061.0 million in total indebtedness and
    $1,910.9 million in shareholders’ equity. The ratio of
    debt-to-total capital at December 31, 2007 was 35.7%,
    compared with 30.8% at December 31, 2006. Our targeted
    debt-to-total capital ratio is 40% or less.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support
    working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest
    and service debt, and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order
    to meet these cash requirements, we intend to use available cash
    and internally generated funds, and to borrow under our
    committed and uncommitted credit facilities.

We paid dividends in 2007 of $59.9 million, compared with
    $56.6 million in 2006 and $53.1 million in 2005. We
    anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a
    quarterly basis.

During 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
    shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of
    $100 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    purchased 1,986,026 shares for $59.4 million pursuant
    to this authorization during 2006. In December 2006, the Board
    of Directors authorized the continuation of the repurchase
    program in 2007 with a maximum dollar limit of
    $40.6 million. This authorization expired on
    December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007 we
    repurchased an additional



1,209,257 shares for $40.6 million pursuant to this
    plan. In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar
    limit of $50 million starting in 2008. The authorization
    expires on December 31, 2008.

In addition to the summary of significant contractual
    obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on
    outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2007,
    variable interest rate debt, including the effects of derivative
    financial instruments, was $202.4 million at a weighted
    average interest rate of 5.27%.

We expect to make contributions in the range of $20 million
    to $25 million to our pension plans in 2008. The 2008
    expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding
    requirements.

As of December 31, 2007, the gross liability for uncertain
    tax positions under FIN 48 is $23.9 million. We do not
    expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be
    made within the next twelve months. We are not able to provide a
    reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments
    relating to the non-current FIN 48 obligations.

Other
    financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based
    upon operating, investing, and financing classifications
    included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also
    measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income. We
    have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of net income. Free cash
    flow and conversion of net income are non-GAAP financial
    measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We
    believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are
    important measures of operating performance because they provide
    us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from
    operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt. In
    addition, free cash flow and conversion of net income are used
    as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives.
    Our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may
    not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
    companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash
    flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash
    flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities:

Off-balance
    sheet arrangements

At December 31, 2007, we had no off-balance sheet financing
    arrangements.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a small number of
    environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $3.5 million and
    $5.6 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Stand-by
    letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to
    bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties
    under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, the outstanding value of these
    instruments totaled $58.5 million and $59.6 million,
    respectively.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently
    adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be
    adopted in the future.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. Our
    significant accounting policies are more fully described in
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the
    application of significant judgment by management in selecting
    the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
    By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our
    historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our



observance of trends in the industry, and information available
    from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an
    accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected would have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment
    of Goodwill

The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated
    using a discounted cash flow approach. The test for impairment
    requires us to make several estimates about projected future
    cash flows and appropriate discount rates. If these estimates
    change, we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill. During
    the fourth quarter of 2007, we completed our annual impairment
    test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment
    loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
    value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets
    held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that
    fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets.
    The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future
    cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
    consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from
    actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
    assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount
    rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels, and
    health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated
    annually and are disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 11 to the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these
    assumptions will affect pension expense.

In December 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that we
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined
    benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in
    our 2006 year-end balance sheet, with changes in the funded
    status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in
    which they occur.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments
    from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our
    U.S. plans of 6.50% in 2007, 6.00% in 2006 and 5.75% in
    2005. The discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 2.00%
    to 5.25% in 2007, 2.00% to 5.15% in 2006 and 2.00% to 4.90% in
    2005. There are no other known or anticipated changes in our
    discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in
    2008.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2007 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2006 and 2005. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable



year-to-year variance from actual returns. In developing the
    expected long-term rate of return, we considered our historical
    returns, with consideration given to forecasted economic
    conditions, our asset allocations, input from external
    consultants and broader longer-term market indices. In 2007, the
    pension plan assets yielded a return of 7.8%, compared to
    returns of 12.3% in 2006 and 4.2% in 2005. In 2007, our expected
    return on plan assets was higher than our actual return on plan
    assets, in 2006, our expected return on plan assets was lower
    than our actual return on plan assets and in 2005, our expected
    return on plan assets was higher than our actual return on plans
    assets. The significant difference between our expected return
    on plan assets compared to our actual return on plan assets in
    2005 was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of our
    common stock during 2005 which approximates 10% of the plan
    assets. There are no known or anticipated changes in our return
    assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2008.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year
    volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

    Financial Statements for further information regarding pension
    plans.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    risk

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We
    are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative
    financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of
    these risks. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are
    major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of
    credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than
    trading purposes. The major accounting policies and utilization
    of these instruments is described more fully in ITEM 8,
    Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of
    long-term debt (including current portion), short-term borrowing
    and interest rate swaps. The net market value of these financial
    instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial
    instrument position. As of December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, the net financial instrument position
    was a liability of $1,076.5 million and
    $753.6 million, respectively.

Interest
    rate risk

Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2007 was primarily comprised of debt
    predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars (97%). This debt
    portfolio is comprised of 62% fixed-rate debt and 38%
    variable-rate debt, not considering the effects of our interest
    rate swaps. Taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap
    agreement we entered with an effective date of April 2006 and
    August 2007, our debt portfolio is comprised of 81% fixed-rate
    debt and 19% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have
    different impacts on the fixed and variable-rate portions of our
    debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion
    of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument
    position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A
    change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt
    portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does
    not impact the net financial instrument position.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio,
    including the interest rate swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2007, a 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates would result in a $2.0 million
    increase or decrease in interest incurred.

Foreign
    currency risk

We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates because some sales transactions, and the
    assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries, are
    denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the
    Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
    and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
    subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
    reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
    believes that, as of December 31, 2007, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting for December 31, 2007. That attestation report is
    set forth immediately following the report of
    Deloitte & Touche LLP on the financial statements
    included herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair,
    Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2007, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Managements Report on Internal Controls over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at ITEM 15 as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2007, of the Company, and our
    report dated February 25, 2008, expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph
    relating to the Company’s changes in its method of
    accounting for uncertain tax positions in 2007.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair,
    Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2007. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and financial statement schedules are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedules based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company at December 31, 2007 and 2006, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2007, in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedules, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for uncertain tax benefits in 2007 and as discussed
    in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated financial statements,
    the Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit
    pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2007, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 25, 2008,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal
    year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31. We report our interim
    quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and

non-U.S.,

that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own 20% to
    50% of the voting stock or have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies of
    the investee are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting and, as a result, our share of the earnings or losses
    of such equity affiliates is included in the statement of
    income. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in
    which Pentair has less than a 20% ownership interest and we do
    not have the ability to exercise significant influence. These
    investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for
    other-than-temporary declines in fair value.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates,
    actual results reported in future periods may be based upon
    amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical
    accounting policies that require our most significant estimates
    and judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including
    goodwill; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in
    making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue
    recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has
    been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery has occurred
    (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to
    the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold
    other than warranty obligations in the normal, ordinary course
    of business. In the event significant post-shipment obligations
    were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until
    substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Sales
    returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly with our
    customers. Revenue from a transaction is recognized only if our
    price is fixed and determinable at the date of sale; the
    customer has paid or is obligated to pay; the customer’s
    obligation would not be changed in the event of theft, physical
    destruction, or damage of the product; the customer has economic
    substance apart from our Company; we do not have significant
    obligations for future performance to directly bring about
    resale of the product by the customer; and the amount of returns
    can reasonably be estimated.

Our return policy allows for customer returns only upon our
    authorization. Goods returned must be product we continue to
    market and must be in salable condition. Returns of custom or
    modified goods are normally not allowed.

At the time of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect
    of returns. Estimated sales returns include consideration of
    historical sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical
    sales return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type
    of customer, and a projection of this experience into the future.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

Pricing
    and sales
    incentives

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
    and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements,
    promotions, and other volume-based incentives at the later of
    the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered.
    Sales incentives given to our customers are recorded as a
    reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable
    benefit for the goods or services in exchange for the
    consideration and (2) we can reasonably estimate the fair
    value of the benefit received. The following represents a
    description of our pricing arrangements, promotions, and other
    volume-based incentives:

Pricing
    arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers, and we
    record sales at the agreed upon net selling price. However, one
    of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a
    percentage of the original purchase price if they can
    demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM customer. At the time of
    sale, we estimate the anticipated refund to be paid based on
    historical experience and reduce sales for the probable cost of
    the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a
    reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as
    cooperative advertising. Under our cooperative advertising
    programs, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of
    sales as an allowance that may be used to advertise and promote
    our products. The customer is not required to provide evidence
    of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the cost of this
    cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The cost of this
    program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based
    incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front
    with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer
    achieves a specified cumulative level of sales or sales
    increase. Under these incentive programs, at the time of sale,
    we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on
    forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least
    monthly, for each customer and sales are reduced for the
    anticipated cost of the rebate. If the forecasted sales for a
    customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect
    the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

There have been no material accounting revisions for
    revenue-recognition related estimates.

Shipping
    and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
    recorded in

Net sales

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by
    Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

Cost of goods sold

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Cash
    equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities
    of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade
    receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts; reducing our
    receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from
    our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience,
    current trends, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic
    credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition.
    We generally do not require collateral. No customer receivable
    balances exceeded 10% of total net receivable balances as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively.

In December 2007 and 2006, we sold approximately
    $50 million and $30 million, respectively, of accounts
    receivable to a third-party financial institution to mitigate
    accounts receivable concentration risk because we did not offer
    or the customer did not take advantage of the early pay
    discounts. In compliance with Statement



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS’)
    No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
    Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities,

sales
    of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts
    receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the proceeds
    are included in the cash flows from operating activities in our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2007 and 2006, a loss
    in the amount of $1.2 million and $0.8 million related
    to the sale of accounts receivable is included in the line
    item

Gain (loss) on sale of assets, net

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
    substantially all costed using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and with an insignificant
    amount of inventories located outside the United States costed
    using a moving average method which approximates FIFO.

Change in
    accounting principle

Prior to October 1, 2006, inventories in the United States
    were costed using both the

last-in,

first-out (“LIFO”) and FIFO methods, and inventories
    outside the United States were costed primarily using the FIFO
    methods with smaller amounts of inventory using the LIFO and
    moving average methods. Effective that date, we elected to
    change our method of accounting to cost all inventories
    previously costed using the LIFO method using the FIFO method to
    better reflect the current value of inventory in the balance
    sheet and to provide a better matching of revenue and expense in
    the consolidated statements of income. In addition, this change
    results in a more unified method of inventory costing. The
    result of the accounting change was immaterial to our
    consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.
    Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the accounting change was
    recorded in the consolidated statement of income in the fourth
    quarter of 2006, rather than retrospectively applied to the
    prior period consolidated financial statements.

Property,
    plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at historical cost. We
    compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the
    following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or
    extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for
    repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When
    property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
    and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment
    loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
    value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets
    held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that
    fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets.
    The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future
    cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

Goodwill
    and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. During the
    fourth quarter of 2007, we completed our annual impairment test
    of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, brand names, patents, non-compete agreements,
    proprietary technology, and customer relationships. Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,

identifiable intangibles with finite
    lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with
    indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible
    assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable
    intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for
    impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. The
    impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of
    the intangible asset with its carrying amount. During the fourth
    quarter of 2007, we completed our annual impairment test for
    those identifiable assets not subject to amortization and
    determined there was no impairment.

Cost
    and equity method investments

We have investments that are accounted for at historical cost
    or, if we have significant influence over the investee, using
    the equity method. Our proportionate share of income or losses
    from investments accounted for under the equity method is
    recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We write down
    or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or
    circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment
    that is other-than-temporary. This requires significant
    judgment, including assessment of the investees’ financial
    condition and in certain cases the possibility of subsequent
    rounds of financing, as well as the investees’ historical
    and projected results of operations and cash flows. If the
    actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different
    from projections, we may incur future charges for the impairment
    of these investments.

Income
    taxes

In June 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued FASB Interpretation No. 48

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

—

an interpretation of FASB Statement 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and
    disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken on a tax return, including a decision
    whether to file or not to file a tax return in a particular
    jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006 and we adopted it on
    January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 increased
    total liabilities by $2.9 million and decreased total
    shareholders’ equity by $2.9 million. The adoption of
    FIN 48 had no impact on our consolidated results of
    operations.

We use the asset and liability approach to account for income
    taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
    the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are
    reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
    management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in
    valuation allowances from period to period are included in our
    tax provision in the period of change.

Environmental

In accordance with

SOP 96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

, we recognize
    environmental

clean-up

liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

generally are not subject to insurance coverage. The cost of
    each environmental

clean-up

is
    estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based
    on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the
    estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the
    likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible
    parties (“PRPs”) will be able to fulfill their
    commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and
    severally liable. The process of estimating environmental

clean-up

liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and
    extent of historical information and physical data relating to a
    contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty
    as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the
    outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs
    at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or
    regulations, advances in

clean-up

technologies, and additional information about the ultimate

clean-up

remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.
    Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in

Other
    current liabilities

and

Other non-current liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance
    subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. As of December 31, 2007 and 2006, reserves
    for policy claims were $61.4 million ($10.0 million
    included in A

ccrued product claims and warranties

and
    $51.4 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

) and $54.3 million ($10.0 million
    included in

Accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $44.3 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

), respectively.

Stock-based
    compensation

We account for the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004),

Share Based Payment,

(“SFAS 123R”) which revised
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(“SFAS 123”) and supersedes
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”) requiring
    us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our
    stock-based compensation awards.

In accordance with SFAS 123R, the estimated grant date fair
    value of each stock-based award is recognized in income on an
    accelerated basis over the requisite service period (generally
    the vesting period). The estimated fair value of each option is
    calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. From
    time to time, we have elected to modify the terms of the
    original grant. These modified grants are accounted for as a new
    award and measured using the fair value method under
    SFAS 123R, resulting in the inclusion of additional
    compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
    Non-vested share awards are recorded as compensation cost over
    the requisite service periods based on the market value on the
    date of grant.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
    by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
    including the dilutive effects of stock options and non-vested
    shares. Unless otherwise noted, references are to diluted
    earnings per share.

Derivative
    financial instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other
    contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative is designated as
    a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If
    the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow
    hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded
    in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are
    recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the
    hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged
    transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge becomes ineffective,
    all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have
    not been settled are recognized in current earnings. For a
    derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a
    hedge, changes in fair value are reported in earnings
    immediately.

We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
    interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of
    ongoing business operations. All hedging instruments are
    designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedge Activities,

as amended. We
    do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes. All other contracts that
    contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also
    meet the requirements of, and have been designated as, normal
    purchases or sales. Our policy is not to enter into contracts
    with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or
    sales.

Foreign
    currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the
    United States are measured using the local currency as the
    functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the
    balance sheet date. The resultant translation adjustments are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
    component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items
    are translated at average monthly rates of exchange.

New
    accounting standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements, but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. The adoption of SFAS 157 is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated results of operations and
    financial condition.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits entities
    to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain
    other items at fair value that are not currently required to be
    measured at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal
    years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of
    SFAS 159 is not expected to have a material impact on our
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In March 2007, the FASB ratified the Emerging Issues Task Force
    (“EITF”) Issue

No. 06-11,

Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share
    Based Payment Awards

(“EITF 06-11”).

EITF 06-11

requires companies to recognize the income tax benefit realized
    from dividends or dividend equivalents that are charged to
    retained earnings and paid to employees for nonvested
    equity-classified employee share-based awards as an increase to
    additional paid-in capital.

EITF 06-11

is effective for fiscal years beginning after September 15,
    2007. The adoption of

EITF 06-11

is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (Revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R replaces
    SFAS No. 141. SFAS 141R retains the purchase
    method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of
    changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are
    recognized in the purchase accounting. SFAS 141R also
    changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization
    of in-process research and development at fair value, and
    requires the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred.
    SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS 141R on our consolidated results of operations and
    financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB 51

(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 changes the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority
    interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests
    and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the
    parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests
    that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for
    as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to
    the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net
    income on the face of the income statement and upon a loss of
    control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained,
    will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized
    in earnings. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply
    retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of
    adopting SFAS 160 on our consolidated results of operations
    and financial condition.

Reclassifications

The 2006 and 2005 Consolidated Statements of Income and the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows has been reclassified from
    the 2006 and 2005 presentation to conform to the 2007
    presentation. The reclassification reflects the presentation of

Equity losses of unconsolidated subsidiary

of
    $3.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, as a
    separate line item below

Operating income

in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income rather than as a component of

Selling, general and administrative

, and as a separate
    line in the

Adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash
    provided by operating activities

in the Consolidated
    Statements of Cash Flows, rather than as a component of

Other
    assets and liabilities

. This reclassification corrects the
    previous presentation and was not material to the financial
    statements. It did not affect

Net income

within the
    Consolidated Statements of Income or net cash provided by (used
    in) operating, investing or financing activities within the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

    $28.5 million, including a cash payment of
    $29.3 million and transaction costs of $0.2 million,
    less cash acquired of $1.0 million. Calmark’s results
    of operations have been included in our consolidated financial

and sales offices in Germany, Austria, France, Hungary, Poland
    and Slovakia. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price
    allocation was $123.4 million, of which approximately
    $53 million is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible
    assets acquired as part of the acquisition were

    15 years.

On April 12, 2006, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    the assets of Geyer’s Manufacturing & Design Inc.
    and FTA Filtration, Inc. (together “Krystil Klear”),
    two privately-held companies, for $15.5 million in cash.

    our consolidated financial statements since the date of
    acquisition. Krystil Klear expands our industrial filtration
    product offering to include a full range of steel and stainless
    steel tanks which house filtration solutions. Goodwill recorded
    as part of the purchase price allocation was $9.2 million,
    all of which is tax deductible.

During 2006, we completed several other small acquisitions
    totaling $14.2 million in cash and notes payable, adding to

    company, for $10.3 million, including a cash payment of
    $10.0 million, transaction costs of $0.2 million, and

Discontinued
    Operations/Divestitures

Effective after the close of business on October 2, 2004,
    we completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”). In
    January 2006, pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of
    our former Tools Group, we completed the repurchase of a
    manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China from BDK for
    approximately $5.7 million. We recorded no gain or loss on
    the repurchase. In March 2006, we completed an outstanding net
    asset value arbitration with BDK relating to the purchase price
    for the sale of our former Tools Group. The decision by the
    arbitrator constituted a final resolution of all disputes
    between BDK and us regarding the net asset value. We paid the
    final net asset value purchase price adjustment pursuant to the
    purchase agreement of $16.1 million plus interest of
    $1.1 million in March 2006, resulting in an incremental
    pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of
    $3.4 million or $1.6 million net of tax. In the third
    quarter of 2006, we resolved a prior year tax item that resulted
    in a $1.4 million income tax benefit related to our former
    Tools Group.

In 2001, we completed the sale of our former Service Equipment
    businesses (Century Mfg. Co. /Lincoln Automotive Company) to
    Clore Automotive, LLC. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we
    reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of
    $2.9 million related to exiting the remaining two
    facilities. In March 2006, we exited a leased facility from our
    former Service Equipment business resulting in a net cash
    outflow of $2.2 million and an immaterial gain from
    disposition.

Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarized
    below. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead previously
    allocated to the Tools Group. The amounts include an allocation
    of interest based on a ratio of the net assets of the
    discontinued operations to the total net assets of Pentair.

We recorded a pretax gain on the disposal of discontinued
    operations of $0.8 million as of December 31, 2007 and
    pre-tax losses on the disposal of discontinued operations of
    $3.6 million and $4.2 million as of December 31,
    2006 and 2005 respectively. The 2007 gain was primarily due to
    the decrease of accruals as we settled certain obligations. The
    2006 loss was primarily due to an unfavorable arbitration ruling
    resulting in a purchase price adjustment associated with the
    sale of our former Tools Group. The additional 2005 loss relates
    to increased reserve requirements for product recalls and
    contingent purchase price adjustments associated with the sale
    of our former Tools Group. Income tax expense of $0.3 was
    recorded for the year ended December 31, 2007 and income
    tax benefits of $3.6 million and $4.2 million were
    recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The effective tax rate for discontinued operations
    in 2007 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the
    settlement of prior period tax returns. The effective tax rate
    for discontinued operations in 2006 differs from the statutory
    rate primarily due to the reversal of prior years’ tax
    reserves and research and development tax credits. The effective
    tax rate in 2005 for discontinued operations differs from the
    statutory rate due primarily to research and development tax
    credits and permanent book/tax differences.

    method investments

As part of the sale of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we received
    37,500 shares of 5% Series C Junior Convertible
    Redeemable Preferred Stock convertible into a 15% equity
    interest in the new organization — LN Holdings
    Corporation. During the second quarter of 2005 we sold our
    interest in the stock LN Holdings Corporation for cash
    consideration of $23.6 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain
    of $5.2 million or an after-tax gain of $3.5 million.
    The terms of the sale agreement established two escrow accounts
    totaling $14 million. We received payments from an escrow
    of $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2005,
    increasing our gain. During 2006 we received $1.2 million
    from the escrow accounts which also increased our gain from the
    sale. Any remaining escrow balances are to be distributed by
    April 2008 to former shareholders in accordance with their
    ownership percentages. Any funds received from settlement of
    escrows in future periods will be accounted for as additional
    gain on sale of this interest.

Equity
    method investments

We have a 50% investment in FARADYNE Motors LLC
    (“FARADYNE”), a joint venture with ITT Water
    Technologies, Inc. that began design, development, and
    manufacturing of submersible pump motors in 2005. We do not
    consolidate the investment in our financial statements as we do
    not have a controlling interest over the investment. The
    investment in and loans to FARADYNE were $8.7 million and
    $5.4 million at December 31, 2007 and
    December 31, 2006, respectively, which is net of our
    proportionate share of the results of their operations.

In 2007, the minimum pension liability adjustment decreased by
    $37.2 million compared to the prior year primarily due to
    the increase in the discount rate and the curtailments of
    certain pension plans and retiree medical benefits. In 2006, the
    minimum pension liability adjustment increased compared to the
    prior year primarily due to the adoption of SFAS 158, as
    noted in Note 11. The net foreign currency translation gain
    in 2007 and 2006 of $72.9 million and $28.5 million,
    respectively, was primarily the result of the weakening of the
    U.S. dollar against the euro. Changes in the market value
    of derivative financial instruments were impacted primarily by
    the changing interest rates. Fluctuations in the value of
    hedging instruments are generally offset by changes in the cash
    flows of the underlying exposures being hedged.

In June 2007, we entered into an amended and restated
    multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Credit
    Facility”). The Credit Facility creates an unsecured,
    committed revolving credit facility of up to $800 million,
    with multi-currency sub-facilities to support investments
    outside the U.S. The Credit Facility expires June 4,
    2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at
    the rate of LIBOR plus 0.50%. Interest rates and fees under the
    Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of
    December 31, 2007, we had $106.0 million of commercial
    paper outstanding that matures within 71 days.

All of the commercial paper was classified as long-term as we

    a long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $29.7 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had
    $13.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2007.

In May 2007, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with
    various institutional investors (the “Agreement”) for
    the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our
    5.87% Senior Notes (“Fixed Notes”) and
    $105 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating
    Rate Senior Notes (“Floating Notes” and with the Fixed
    Notes, the “Notes”). The Fixed Notes are due in May
    2017. The Floating Notes are due in May 2012 and bear interest
    equal to the 3 month LIBOR plus 0.50%. The Agreement
    contains customary events of default.

We used $250 million of the proceeds from the sale of the
    Notes to retire the $250 million

364-day

Term
    Loan Agreement that we entered into in April 2007, which we used
    in part to pay the cash purchase price of our Porous Media
    acquisition which closed in April 2007.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of
    December 31, 2007.

Derivative

Cash-flow
    hedges

In August 2007, we entered into a $105 million interest
    rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for a fixed
    rate obligation without the exchange of the underlying principle
    amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. The
    effective date of the swap was August 30, 2007. The swap
    agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.89% and expires in May
    2012. The fixed interest rate of 4.89% plus the .50% interest
    rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective fixed interest
    rate of 5.39%. The fair value of the swap was a liability of
    $3.7 million at December 31, 2007 and is recorded in

Other non-current liabilities

.

In September 2005, we entered into a $100 million interest
    rate swap agreement with several major financial institutions to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for fixed
    rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying
    principle amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures.
    The effective date of the fixed rate swap was April 25,
    2006. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.68% and
    expires in July 2013. The fixed interest rate of 4.68% plus the
    .60% interest rate spread over LIBOR, results in an effective
    fixed interest rate of 5.28%. The fair value of the swap was a
    liability of $2.5 million and an asset $1.9 million at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively and is recorded in
    O

respectively.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as and
    are effective as cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps
    are recorded as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, with changes in their fair value included in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

    Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified
    into earnings at the time the related interest expense is
    recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs.
    No hedging relationships were de-designated during 2007.

    (continued)

In anticipation of issuing new debt in the second quarter of
    2007 and to partially hedge the risk of future increases to the
    treasury rate, we entered into an agreement on March 30,
    2007 to lock in existing ten-year rates on $200 million.
    The treasury rate was fixed at 4.64% and the agreement was
    settled on May 3, 2007. The treasury rate lock agreement
    was designated as and was effective as a cash-flow hedge. The
    treasury rate lock agreement was settled at an interest rate of
    4.67% and the corresponding settlement benefit of
    $0.5 million is included in OCI in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheet and is recognized in earnings over the life of the related
    debt.

    variable rate debt) — recorded amount approximates
    fair value because of the short maturity period;

•

long-term fixed rate debt, including current
    maturities — fair value is based on market quotes
    available for issuance of debt with similar terms; and

•

interest rate swap agreements — fair value is based on

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of
    these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets”
    (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
    in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities”
    (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the
    tax impact has not yet been recorded in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income).

We adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on January 1,
    2007. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we
    recorded an adjustment that decreased retained earnings by
    $2.9 million.

Subsequent to the adjustment to retained earnings of
    $2.9 million, our total liability for gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of January 1, 2007, the date of adoption of
    FIN 48, was $16.9 million. If recognized,
    $15.0 million would affect our effective tax rate. Included
    in the total liability for unrecognized tax benefits of
    $16.9 million at the date of adoption of FIN 48 was
    $2.5 million related to discontinued operations. If
    recognized, $1.8 million would affect the effective tax
    rate for discontinued operations.

Gross unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007

$

Included in the $23.9 million of total gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 was $21.2 million
    of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective
    tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2007 may decrease by a
    range of $0 to $4.4 million during the next twelve months
    primarily as a result of the resolution of federal, state and
    foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of
    limitations.

We record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in

Provision for income taxes

and

Net
    interest expense

, respectively, which is consistent with our
    past practices. As of January 1, 2007, we had recorded
    approximately $0.3 million for the possible payment of
    penalties and $1.5 million related to the possible payment
    of interest. During 2007 we recognized additional interest
    expense of $1.9 million. As of December 31, 2007, we
    had recorded approximately $0.3 million for the possible
    payment of penalties and $3.0 million related to the
    possible payment of interest.

During 2007, our effective tax rate was impacted by a favorable
    adjustment related to the measurement of deferred tax assets and
    liabilities to account for the changes in German tax law enacted
    on August 17, 2007.

During 2006, our effective tax rate was impacted by favorable
    resolution of prior years’ federal tax returns and higher
    utilization of foreign tax credits.

During 2005, our effective tax rate was impacted by R&D tax
    credits, and favorable resolution of prior years’ federal
    tax returns. Our effective tax rate was also impacted favorably
    by tax deductions for profits associated with qualified domestic
    production activities. These favorable items were offset by an
    unfavorable settlement for a routine German tax examination
    related to prior years as well as the tax impact of the adoption
    of SFAS 123R.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our
    intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to
    repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.
    As of December 31, 2007, approximately $139.0 million
    of unremitted earnings attributable to international
    subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely invested. It is
    not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be
    payable if such earnings were to be remitted. Foreign tax
    credits would be available to reduce or eliminate the resulting
    United States income tax liability.

Other Long-Term Assets includes a deferred tax asset of
    $10.7 million, reflected above in other, related to a
    foreign tax credit carryover from the tax period ended
    December 31, 2006. This foreign tax credit is eligible for
    carryforward until the tax period ending December 31, 2016.

The determination of annual income tax expense takes into
    consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for
    open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    has examined our U.S. federal income tax returns through
    2003 with no material adjustments. The IRS has also completed a
    survey of our 2004 U.S. federal income tax return with no
    material findings. In connection with the completion of the 2002
    to 2003 federal income tax audit and the 2004 survey, we
    recognized benefits of $8.0 million and $1.8 million
    in our second and third quarter 2006 income statements,
    respectively. We were notified during February, 2008 that the
    IRS will be initiating an exam of our 2005 and 2006 federal tax
    returns. We do not expect any material impact on earnings to
    result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years;
    however, actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.

Non-U.S. tax

losses of $27.0 million and $9.1 million were
    available for carryforward at December 31, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively. A valuation allowance reflected above in other, of
    $2.4 million and $1.6 million exists for deferred
    income tax benefits related to the

non-U.S. loss

carryforwards available that may not be realized as of
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We believe that
    sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective
    countries to allow us to fully recover the remainder of the tax
    losses. The

non-U.S. operating

losses are subject to varying expiration periods and will begin
    to expire in 2009. State tax losses of $69.0 million and
    $64.4 million were available for carryforward at
    December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A valuation
    allowance reflected above in other, of $2.4 million and
    $2.6 million exists for deferred income tax benefits
    related to the carryforwards available at December 31, 2007
    and December 31, 2006, respectively. Certain state tax
    losses will expire in 2008, while others are subject to
    carryforward periods of up to twenty years.

11.

Benefit
    Plans

Pension
    and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based
    principally on an employee’s years of service

and/or

compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also
    provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance
    benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life
    insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a
    December 31 measurement date each year.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

On December 31, 2006, we adopted SFAS 158 which
    requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status
    of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or
    liability in our 2006 year-end Consolidated Balance Sheets,
    with changes in the funded status recognized through other
    comprehensive income, net of tax.

In 2007, under the requirements of SFAS No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,

we recognized a pension curtailment gain of
    $5.5 million related to the announcement that we will be
    freezing certain pension plans as of December 31, 2017.
    Also, we recognized a curtailment gain of $4.1 million
    related to the termination of certain post-retirement health
    care benefits.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our

expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of AA or
    higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate
    the effects of call provisions. This produced a discount rate
    for our U.S. plans of 6.50% in 2007, 6.00% in 2006 and
    5.75% in 2005. The discount rates on our foreign plans ranged
    from 2.00% to 5.25% in 2007, 2.00% to 5.15% in 2006 and 2.00% to
    4.90% in 2005. There are no other known or anticipated changes
    in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension
    expense in 2008.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2007 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2006 and 2005. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable year-to-year variance from actual
    returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we
    considered our historical returns, with consideration given to
    forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations, input
    from external consultants and broader longer-term market
    indices. In 2007, the pension plan assets yielded a return of
    7.8%, compared to returns of 12.3% in 2006 and 4.2% in 2005. In
    2007, our expected return on plan assets was higher than our
    actual return on plan assets, in 2006, our expected return on
    plan assets was lower than our actual return on plan assets and
    in 2005, our expected return on plan assets was higher than our
    actual return on plans assets. The significant difference
    between our expected return on plan assets compared to our
    actual return on plan assets in 2005 was primarily attributable
    to the fluctuations of our common stock during 2005 which
    approximates 10% of the plan assets. There are no known or
    anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact
    our pension expense in 2008. We base our determination of
    pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of
    assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This
    market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses
    over a five-year period from the year in which they occur.
    Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference
    between the expected return calculated using the market-related
    value of assets and the actual return based on the
    market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value
    of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension
    and post-retirement related adjustments to equity

In 2005, our discount rate remained consistent with 2004;
    however, a lower return on plan assets as well as a decrease in
    the discount rates for our foreign plans resulted in an
    after-tax charge to equity of $5.7 million. In 2006, our
    discount rate increased from 5.75% to 6.00% and our return on
    plan assets was higher than anticipated. Before the effect of
    adopting SFAS 158, we had an after-tax increase in equity
    of $1.5 million. The effect of initially applying
    SFAS 158 resulted in an after-tax charge to equity of
    $12.9 million. In 2007, our discount rate increased from
    6.00% to 6.50%, and we incurred curtailment gains in both
    pension and retiree medical plans which resulted in an after-tax
    increase to equity of $37.2 million.

Net
    periodic benefit cost

Total net periodic pension benefit cost was $18.3 million
    in 2007, $24.5 million in 2006, and $20.0 million in
    2005. Total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected to be
    approximately $20.0 million in 2008. The net periodic
    pension benefit cost for 2008 has been estimated assuming a
    discount rate of 6.50% and an expected return on plan assets of
    8.50%.

Unrecognized
    pension and post-retirement gains

As of our December 31, 2007 measurement date, our plans
    have $20.4 million of cumulative unrecognized gains. To the
    extent the unrecognized gains, when adjusted for the difference
    between market and market related values of assets, exceeds 10%
    of the projected benefit obligation, it will be amortized into
    expense each year on a straight-line basis over the remaining
    expected future-working lifetime of active participants
    (currently approximating 12 years). The amount included in
    net periodic benefit cost for loss amortization was
    $1.8 million and $3.3 million in 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Objective

The primary objective of our pension plans is to meet
    commitments to our employees at a reasonable cost to the
    company. This is primarily accomplished through growth of
    capital and safety of the funds invested. The plans will
    therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital
    over inflation through appreciation of securities held and
    through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and
    interest income.

We regularly review our asset allocation and periodically
    rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when
    considered appropriate. From time to time, we may be outside our
    targeted ranges by amounts we deem acceptable.

Equity securities include Pentair common stock in the amount of
    $32.8 million and $29.6 million at December 31,
    2007 and 2006, respectively.

Contributions

Pension contributions totaled $13.0 million and
    $4.3 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our 2008
    pension contributions are expected to be in the range of
    $20 million to $25 million. The increase in the 2008
    expected contribution relates primarily to the enactment of the
    Pension Protection Act of 2006. The 2008 expected contributions
    will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements.

    plan

We have a 401(k) plan (“the plan”) with an employee
    stock ownership (“ESOP”) bonus component, which covers
    certain union and nearly all non-union U.S. employees who
    meet certain age requirements. Under the plan, eligible
    U.S. employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of
    their eligible compensation. Matching contributions are made in
    cash to employees who meet certain eligibility and service
    requirements. Our matching contribution is fixed at 50% of
    eligible employee contributions, and is limited to 5% of
    employee compensation contributed by employees.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet
    certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP
    contribution equal to 1.5% of annual eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the plan and ESOP was approximately
    $11.9 million, $12.3 million, and $8.8 million,
    in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively.

Other
    retirement compensation

Total other accrued retirement compensation was

Authorized
    shares

We may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our
    Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those
    shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board
    of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock with
    authorization to issue up to 2.5 million shares,
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
    $0.10 per share. No shares of preferred stock were issued or
    outstanding as of December 31, 2007 or December 31,
    2006.

Purchase
    rights

On December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock.
    The dividend was payable upon the close of business on
    January 28, 2005 to the shareholders of record upon the
    close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right

entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of
    a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock,
    at a price of $240.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject
    to adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless
    certain change in control events occur, such as a person
    acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership
    of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. The description
    and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement,
    dated December 10, 2004. The Rights will expire on
    January 28, 2015, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or
    exchanged in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement.
    On January 28, 2005, the common share purchase rights
    issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated July 31, 1995
    were redeemed in their entirety for an amount equal to $0.0025
    per right.

Share
    repurchases

During 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of
    shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of
    $100 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had
    purchased 1,986,026 shares for $59.4 million pursuant
    to this authorization during 2006. In December 2006, the Board
    of Directors authorized the continuation of the repurchase
    program in 2007 with a maximum dollar limit of
    $40.6 million. This authorization expired on
    December 31, 2007. As of December 31, 2007 we
    repurchased an additional 1,209,257 shares for
    $40.6 million pursuant to this plan. In December 2007, the
    Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our
    common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $50 million
    starting in 2008. The authorization expires on December 31,

Omnibus
    stock incentive plan

In April 2004, the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended and
    Restated (the “Plan”) was approved by shareholders.
    The Plan authorizes the issuance of additional shares of our
    common stock and extends through April 2014. The Plan allows for
    the granting of:

•

nonqualified stock options;

•

incentive stock options;

•

non-vested shares;

•

rights to non-vested shares;

•

incentive compensation units (ICUs);

•

stock appreciation rights;

•

performance shares; and

•

performance units.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee (the
    “Committee”), which is made up of independent members
    of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards
    under the Plan are managerial, administrative, or other key
    employees who are in a position to make a material contribution
    to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of
    Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the
    recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards,
    establish certain terms and conditions of award grants, and take
    certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan
    provides that no more than 20% of the total shares available for
    issuance under the Plan may be used to make awards other than
    stock options and limits the Committee’s authority to
    reprice awards or to cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

Non-qualified
    and incentive stock options

Under the Plan, we may grant stock options to any eligible
    employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally
    vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and
    expire ten years after the grant date. Prior to 2006, option
    grants typically had a reload feature when shares are retired to
    pay the exercise price, allowing individuals to receive
    additional options upon exercise equal to the number of shares
    retired. Option awards granted after 2005 under the Plan do not
    have a reload feature attached to the option.

Non-vested
    shares and rights to non-vested shares

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded non-vested shares
    or rights to non-vested shares (awards) of our common stock.
    Share awards generally vest from two to five years after
    issuance, subject to continuous employment and certain other
    conditions. Non-vested share awards are valued at market value
    on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period.
    Annual expense for the value of non-vested shares and rights to
    non-vested shares was $9.3 million in 2007,
    $11.1 million in 2006, and $7.0 million in 2005.

Stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares, and performance
    units

Under the Plan, the Committee is permitted to issue these
    awards; however, there have been no issuances of these awards.

Outside
    directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options are granted to outside directors
    under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the
    “Directors Plan”) with an exercise price equal to the
    market value of the shares on the option grant dates. Options
    generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant
    date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors
    Plan expired in January 2008.

    treatment, and enjoyment of water. Water segment products
    include water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification
    components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and
    pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Technical Products

— designs,
    manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom
    enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and
    electrical components; thermal management products; and
    accessories. Applications served include industrial machinery,
    data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and
    measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general

    subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations,
    and intercompany eliminations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and
    operating income of the segments and use a variety of ratios to
    measure performance. These results are not necessarily
    indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred
    had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during
    the periods presented.

Net sales are based on the location in which the sale
    originated. Long-lived assets represent property, plant, and
    equipment, net of related depreciation.

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple
    markets and customers for which we do not have the information
    systems to track revenues by primary product category. However,
    our net sales by segment are representative of our sales by
    major product category.

We sell our products through various distribution channels
    including wholesale and retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. In our Water segment, one
    customer accounted for just over 11% of segment sales in 2007,
    one customer accounted for just over 10% of segment sales in
    2006 and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of
    segment sales in 2005. In our Technical Products segment, no
    single customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in
    2007, 2006, or 2005.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
    potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.
    We settled some of the claims in prior years; to date our
    recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2007
    and 2006, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $3.5 million and
    $5.6 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims could change in the future.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald our captive
    insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these
    claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For
    all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on
    an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated based on existing information. The accruals are
    adjusted periodically as additional information becomes
    available. We have not experienced significant unfavorable
    trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability
    lawsuits or personal injury claims.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Horizon
    litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs,
    a class action and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise
    Lines, Inc. (“Celebrity”) were brought against Essef
    Corporation (“Essef”) and certain of its subsidiaries
    prior to our acquisition of Essef in August 1999. The claims
    against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the
    allegation that Essef designed, manufactured and marketed two
    sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the
    spa system on the Horizon cruise ship and allegations that the
    spa and filters contained Legionnaire’s disease bacteria
    that infected certain passengers on cruises in July 1994.

The individual and class claims by passengers were tried and
    resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the
    part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister
    company, Fantasia (together 30%). After expiration of post-trial
    appeals, we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of
    $7.0 million in the passenger cases, plus interest of
    approximately $1.6 million, in January 2004. All of the
    passenger cases have now been resolved through either settlement
    or judgment.

The only remaining unresolved claims in this case were those
    brought by Celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak.
    Celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and
    costs for prior litigation as well as out-of-pocket losses, lost
    profits and loss of business enterprise value. The first trial
    in 2006 resulted in a verdict against the Essef defendants for
    Celebrity’s out-of-pocket expenses of $10.4 million.
    Verdicts at this trial for lost profits ($47.6 million) and
    lost enterprise value ($135 million) were reversed in
    January 2007. In the retrial in June 2007, the jury awarded
    Celebrity damages for lost profits for 1994 and 1995 of
    $15.2 million (after netting for amounts taken into account
    by the earlier verdict for out-of-pocket expenses). The verdicts
    are exclusive of pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees.

In January 2008, the District Court ruled on post-trial motions
    and other previously undecided issues in this litigation. Our
    motion to reverse the jury verdict in the second trial on lost
    profits after 1994 was not granted; Celebrity’s damages for
    out-of-pocket costs and lost profits were reduced by 30%
    reflecting an earlier finding of its contributory negligence;
    and pre-judgment interest was awarded to Celebrity at a rate
    equal to semiannual T-Bill rates compounded annually. In
    addition, Celebrity and the Essef defendants settled
    Celebrity’s claim for attorneys’ fees in the passenger
    cases for $3 million, inclusive of all interest. This
    amount was paid and expensed in the fourth quarter of 2007.

In the aggregate, damages against the Essef defendants in this
    litigation total approximately $30.5 million, inclusive of
    interest through 2007. Judgment on the verdicts has not yet been
    entered. Once entered, both parties will have thirty days in
    which to appeal from the judgment. The Essef defendants have not
    yet determined whether and on what issues they may appeal in
    this case.

We have assessed the impact of the latest ruling on our
    previously established reserves for this matter and, based on
    information available at this time, have not changed our
    reserves, except to take into account appropriate interest
    accruals.

We believe that any judgment we pay in this matter would be
    tax-deductible in the year paid or in subsequent years. In
    addition to the impact of any loss on this matter on our
    earnings per share when recognized, we may need to borrow funds
    from our banks or other sources to pay any judgment, plus
    interest, upon settlement or finally determined after exhaustion
    of all appeals.

Warranties
    and guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product
    lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various
    potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as
    pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or
    other obligations. The subject matter, amounts, and duration of
    any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of
    liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to
    transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such
    indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably
    estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments
    for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur
    a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a
    material effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45
    (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Others

, we recognize, at the inception of a
    guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
    undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products.
    Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a
    review of historical warranty and service claim experience.
    Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical
    experience warrant.

Stand-by

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to
    bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties
    under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, the
    outstanding value of these instruments totaled
    $58.5 million and $59.6 million, respectively.

Subsequent
    Events

In February 2008, consistent with our strategy to refine our
    portfolio and more fully focus of our growing core pool
    equipment business globally, we agreed to sell our National Pool
    Tile business unit to Pool Corporation in a cash transaction.
    National Pool Tile is the leading wholesale distributor of pool
    tile and composite pool finishes serving professional
    contractors in the swimming pool refurbish and construction
    markets. NPT has annual net sales of over $60 million, with
    the majority of its sales in the refurbish market. The business
    sale and first quarter results will be treated as discontinued
    operations. The transaction is subject to customary closing
    conditions and is targeted to close by the end of the first
    quarter 2008.

    to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the
    Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported,
    within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange
    Commission’s rules and forms, and to ensure that

    executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to
    allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
