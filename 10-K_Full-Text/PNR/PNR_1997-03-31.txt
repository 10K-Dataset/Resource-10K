PART I

Item 1.  Business

(a)  General Development of the Business.

The Registrant was incorporated in 1966 under the laws
of Minnesota.  In the past year, the Registrant has
not changed its form of organization or mode of
conducting business.  The Registrant grows through
internal development and acquisitions.  As in the past,
periodic dispositions of assets or business units are
possible when they no longer fit with the long-term
strategies of the Registrant.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Registrant acquired the net
assets and the subsidiaries of Schroff GmbH
(Schroff) from Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp for a cash
purchase price of approximately $140 million net
of cash acquired.  Schroff manufactures and sells
enclosures, cases, subracks and accessories for
commercial electronic and instrumentation applications. 

In September 1994, Pentair announced that it was
exploring strategic alternatives for its paper businesses,
including their possible sale.  In the second quarter of
1995, all of the Pentair paper businesses were sold. 
On April 1, 1995 the company sold its Cross Pointe Paper
Corporation subsidiary for $203.3 million to
Noranda Forest, Inc.  On June 30, 1995 the company sold
its Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corporations, its
50% share of Lake Superior paper Industries (LSPI) joint
venture and its 12% share of Superior Recycled
Fiber Industries (SRFI) for $115.6 million cash to
Consolidated Papers, Inc.

The sale transactions have permitted Pentair to focus its
commitments and resources on the industrial
products sector, building upon the strong growth and
leading market positions these businesses have
achieved.  

Effective November 1, 1995, the Company acquired Fleck
Controls, Inc., a manufacturer of control valves 
which are major components in residential water
softeners, and commercial and industrial water
conditioning systems for $133.9 million.  Pentair considers
Fleck to be its first major step in entering the
water treatment business. This will be continued as
Pentair pursues other product offerings and new
channels within the water products market. 

During 1996, the Company completed four strategic 
acquisitions that strengthened market positions 
throughout the world. In January, Myers acquired Aplex 
to broaden its industrial pump line.  In June, Porter-Cable 
acquired FLEX, a German power tool company.  In
November, the Company acquired Century Manufacturing
a manufacturer which serves the vehicle service
equipment markets, complementing its Lincoln Automotive
subsidiary.  In December, Fleck Controls purchased
SIATA, an Italian manufacturer of water conditioning
control equipment. 


(b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments.

The Registrant's business is conducted in two industry
segments.  The Specialty Products segment
manufactures woodworking machinery; portable power
tools; valves for water conditioning equipment; and
pumps and pumping systems.  The General Industrial
Equipment segment manufactures electrical and
electronic enclosures and wireways; industrial lubricating
systems and material dispensing equipment;
vehicle service equipment; and sporting ammunition.
Business segment financial information is found on
page 30 and page 53 (Note 17) of the 1996 Annual
Report to Shareholders.

    Competitive conditions.

Delta participates in the middle range of the overall market
for general purpose woodworking machinery. 
The addressed market is focused on high quality, feature
oriented products and value added services for
the home shop, contractor, and small shop markets. 
Delta markets the industry's broadest line of products
for its addressed market.  Delta's numerous competitors
do have individual products which compete with
certain of Delta's products.  Competition in this market
focuses on quality, features, service and price.

Porter-Cable competes in the professional portable
tool market which is highly competitive. 
Porter-Cable faces several major competitors across its
addressed market.  Product innovation, features, 
performance, quality, service, delivery and price are all
competitive factors.

Myers faces many competitors across its product
lines.  Price, delivery, and quality are competitive factors.

Fleck addresses the water treatment market.  Fleck is one
of the four primary manufacturers of control
valves in the United States and Europe.  Broad product
offerings, product development and customer
support and service are competitive factors.   Fleck has a
significant market share in the residential valve
market and a leading market share in the commercial
valve market.  Fleck sells to both OEMs and 
independent distributors for inclusion in water control
systems which are sold directly to the end user.


  Description of the General Industrial Equipment
Segment:
    Products and marketing.

The following table sets forth, for each of the last three
years, the General Industrial Equipment segment
product class net sales in excess of 10 percent of
consolidated net sales.

  
Electrical and Electronic Enclosures.  Through the
Hoffman Engineering Company division of
Federal-Hoffman, Inc. (Hoffman) and through Schroff
GmbH and its international subsidiaries (Schroff),  the
Registrant manufactures metallic and composite

include heavy industry (steel mills, cement plants,
pulp and paper, power plants), automobile manufacturers,
commercial vehicles, agriculture, construction
equipment, food and beverage, mining, printing, and
general lubrication markets.

    Competitive conditions.

Hoffman is the largest North American manufacturer of
electrical enclosures and wireways, having a
market share estimated to be about 25% of our addressed
market.  It is currently the only manufacturer
with national distribution and its competitors are generally
smaller, regional manufacturers.  Hoffman also
participates in the North American electronic enclosures
market, facing competition from a large number of
firms, with three or four established firms leading the
market.  In both markets, the most significant
competitive factors are price, product innovation, service,
quality, breadth of product line, and delivery. 
Schroff is a significant manufacturer in Europe's electronic
enclosure market and a  technological leader. 
Schroff, like Hoffman, has a comprehensive product
range.  Schroff faces competition from a large number
of firms, some of whom manufacture a broad
range of enclosures and some who focus on
smaller niche markets.  Significant competitive factors are
product innovation and quality.

Federal and its two primary competitors, Winchester and
Remington, have a combined market share of
approximately 90% in the U.S. sporting ammunition
market, with the balance coming from smaller domestic
competitors and foreign ammunition manufacturers. 
Quality, delivery, price and terms are significant
competitive factors.

Lincoln Industrial ,  Lincoln Automotive and Century face
three to five major competitors and several
smaller competitors across their product lines. 
Competition involving industrial lubricating systems and
material dispensing equipment tends to center around
quality, systems capability, and application
knowledge.  Price becomes a more significant competitive
factor for vehicle servicing equipment.

  Information Regarding Both Segments:

Working capital items.

Federal's working capital builds from January through
September as inventories are increased to meet third
quarter shipping schedules.  Management continues to
focus on reducing working capital requirements
through management of receivable and inventory levels.  

    Status of new products.

The industries in which the segments participate are
essentially mature and do not experience the
introduction of many products that materially change the
nature of the industry.  Individual manufacturers
generally make improvements or apply new technologies
to existing products.  

    Raw materials.

The raw materials used in the manufacturing process
include steel (bar and sheet) various metals including
brass and lead, gunpowder and plastic.  Selected motors,
castings, plastic parts and components are also
purchased.  The supply of all raw materials and
components is currently adequate.

Delta and Porter-Cable import selected tools in their
product offerings.  Design and engineering of these
products is performed primarily by Delta.  The
manufacturing process is controlled and monitored for
most
of these products in factories dedicated to Delta
production.  Supply of these products is currently
adequate
and timely.

    Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and
concessions.

The businesses own a number of U.S. and foreign
patents and trademarks.  They were acquired over
many years and relate to many products and
improvements.  No one patent or trademark is of material
importance to either segment.

    Seasonal aspects.

For either segment, there is no strong seasonal aspect.

    Backlog.

The segments normally do not experience backlogs for
substantial periods of time.  The nature of the
businesses emphasizes maintaining inventories sufficient
to satisfy customer needs on a timely basis, and
production and sourcing is geared towards providing
adequate inventories in order to minimize customer
back orders.  Accordingly, backlogs are not material to
understanding the sales trends or manufacturing
fluctuations of the segments.

    Dependence on limited number of customers.

The Registrant as a whole is not dependent on a single
customer or on a few customers.  The loss of a
limited number of customers would not have a material
adverse impact on the Registrant.

    Government contracts.

The Registrant has no material portion of sales under
government contracts that may be subject to
renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the
election of the government.

    Employees.

As of December 31, 1996, the Registrant and its
subsidiaries employed approximately 9,770 persons, of
which 2,050 were represented by unions having collective
bargaining agreements.

Labor contracts negotiated in 1996 were: International
Union of Electrical Workers - Jonesboro, Arkansas
(extended to April 4, 1999 ) 215 employees.

Contracts expiring in 1997: Molders and Allied Workers
Local 45 - Ashland, Ohio (expires 5/1/97) 49
employees; United Auto Workers - St. Louis, Missouri
(expires 6/6/97) 144 employees; Molders and Allied
Workers Local 19 - Guelph, Ontario, Canada (expires
7/1/97) 7 employees; and Patternworkers League -
Ashland, Ohio (expires 9/1/97) 1 employee.

The Registrant considers its employee relations to be
good and feels future contracts will be able to be
negotiated for the benefit of the business and the
employees.


(d)  Financial Information about Foreign Operations.

The Registrant operates primarily in North America and
Europe.  See discussion of foreign operations
incorporated by reference.

    Item 3. Legal Proceedings.
  
     The Registrant or its subsidiaries have been made
  parties to actions filed, or have been given notice of 
  potential claims, relating to the conduct of its
  business, including those pertaining to product liability,
  environmental and employment matters.  Major
  matters which may have an impact on the Registrant
  are discussed below.  The Registrant believes that it is
  remote that the outcome of such matters will have a
  material adverse effect on the Registrant's financial
  position or future results of operations, based on
  current  circumstances known to the Registrant.
    
     Federal-Hoffman, Inc.  Federal Cartridge, a division of
  Federal-Hoffman, has been named by the EPA as a
  Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) in connection
  with a  waste disposal site in Greer, South Carolina. 
  The EPA issued an administrative order effective April
  29, 1992 to Federal-Hoffman and 96 other entities to
  compel the cleanup of the Aqua-Tech Environmental,
  Inc. site.  Federal-Hoffman is working with a group of
  other PRPs to negotiate with the EPA regarding the
  cleanup of the site.  A surface cleanup of the site is
  complete.  Federal Cartridge paid $442,000 toward
  the cost of the surface cleanup.  
  
     On March 16, 1995, the EPA notified Federal Cartridge
  that it is a PRP related to the subsurface of the
  Aqua-Tech site.  Pending EPA approval, the PRP
  group anticipates beginning in 1997 a study of the soil
  and groundwater to determine the extent of
  subsurface contamination.  The cost of such study,
  any necessary remediation and the size of allocation,
  if any, to Federal-Hoffman is unknown to the
  Registrant at this time.  Federal-Hoffman however,
  anticipates its allocation in the subsurface action to be
  positively impacted by the nature of its waste and the
  fact that virtually all of its waste was accounted for
  and removed during the surface remediation.
  
     In October 1992, Hoffman Engineering, a division of
  Federal-Hoffman, was also named as a PRP in
  connection with the Aqua-Tech site.  Hoffman has
  settled out of both the surface and subsurface
  remediation as a de minimis party. 
  
     Delta International Machinery.  In January 1993,
  Beaver-Delta Machinery Corp. (Beaver-Delta), a
  former subsidiary of Delta International Machinery
  Corp., and three other parties were sued by a
  commercial developer and current owner of real
  estate in Guelph, Ontario that Rockwell International
  (Rockwell) previously owned and that was acquired by
  Beaver-Delta in 1984. Trichlorethylene (TCE) and
  other contamination of soil
  and groundwater was alleged.  Preliminary investigation
  indicated that Beaver-Delta did not use TCE during
  the short period that it owned the property at issue. 
  Beaver-Delta served notice on Rockwell of its intent to
  seek indemnification from Rockwell for all costs
  related to that matter.  The lawsuit was dismissed with
  prejudice in August 1995 after two years of inactivity.
    
     In July 1996, the Registrant received notice of a
  potential claim from Rockwell regarding the alleged
  contamination of the same property.  In June 1996,
  the Ontario Ministry of Environment and Energy
  (MOEE) requested Rockwell to investigate the site
  and develop a  cleanup program.  The extent and cost
  of such a cleanup program is unknown at this time. 
  The Registrant continues to believe that the Asset
  Purchase Agreement with Rockwell calls for Rockwell
  to be responsible for this matter.  The Registrant
  believes that this matter is unlikely to result in material
  liability.
    
     Porter-Cable Corporation.  In November 1993, the
  Tennessee Department of Environment and
  Conservation (TDEC) issued to Porter-Cable
  Corporation (Porter-Cable) and Rockwell International
  Corporation (Rockwell)  an administrative order
  requiring them to investigate, and if necessary, clean
  up alleged groundwater contamination at a
  manufacturing facility located in Madison County,
  Tennessee.  The facility was acquired by Porter-Cable
  from Rockwell in 1981.  Porter-Cable reached an
  agreement with Rockwell regarding sharing  costs and
  expenses related to investigation of the site.  The
  Registrant believes that this matter is unlikely to result
  in material liability or material changes in operations. 
  No estimate of the projected response cost liability
  can be made based on information currently known to
  the Company.
    
     Discontinued Paper Operations. Responsibility for
  certain environmental obligations and potential liability
  of the Registrant's former Cross Pointe Paper
  Corporation subsidiary were retained by the
  Registrant as a part of the sale of Cross Pointe. At the
  time of the sale, the Registrant established accruals
  for potential liabilities relating to environmental
  conditions existing on or before April 1995,  based on
  extensive studies of the sites involved.  Cost for
  certain of these environmental conditions are borne
  entirely by the Registrant; for other conditions, the
  Registrant bears only a portion of the costs  which
  may be incurred in connection therewith.  In 1996,
  the Registrant paid approximately $445,000 in costs
  covered by those accruals.  The Registrant is closely
  monitoring the status of all open environmental
  conditions and has established procedures with the
  buyer dealing with activities at the affected sites.  Few
  of the retained liabilities involve conditions or sites that
  are active at this time.
    
     Responsibility for environmental obligations of the
  Registrant's former Niagara of Wisconsin Paper
  Corporation subsidiary and its two joint ventures, Lake
  Superior Paper Industries and Superior Recycled Fiber
  Industries, was not retained as part of the sale of
  these entities.  Customary warranties were given
  regarding unknown environmental conditions at these
  sites, but the Registrant does not anticipate any
  significant liability therefor.
    
     Product Liability Claims.   As of March 1, 1997, the
  Registrant or its subsidiaries are defendants in 
  approximately 143 product liability lawsuits and have
  been notified of approximately 160 additional claims. 
  The Registrant has had and currently has in place
  insurance coverage it deems adequate for its needs. 
  A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are
  insured by Penwald, a regulated insurance company
  wholly owned by the Registrant.  See discussion in
  Item 7 (MD&A - Insurance Subsidiary) and Item 8
  (Note 1 to the Financial
  Statements).    Accounting accruals covering the 
  deductible portion of  liability claims not covered by
  Penwald have been established and are reviewed on
  a regular basis.  The Registrant has not experienced
  unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency
  of product liability claims.
    
    
    Item 4. Submission of Matters to a Vote of Security
  Holders.
    
    During the fourth quarter, no matter was submitted to a
  vote of security holders.

  occurred within the 24 months prior to the date of the
  Registrant's most recent financial statements.
