Customers

Our Water Group distributes its products through wholesale
    distributors, retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. Information regarding
    significant customers in our Water Group is contained in
    ITEM 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sales “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Competition

Our Water Group faces numerous domestic and international
    competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources.
    Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are continuing
    trends in the water industry. Competition in commercial and
    residential pump markets focuses on brand names, product
    performance, quality, and price. While home center and national
    retailers are important for residential lines of water and
    wastewater pumps, they are much less important for commercial
    pumps. For municipal pumps, competition


focuses on performance to meet required specifications, service,
    and price. Competition in water treatment and filtration
    components focuses on product performance and design, quality,
    delivery, and price. For pool and spa equipment, competition
    focuses on brand names, product performance, quality, and price.
    We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and
    high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We
    believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality
    also contribute to our continuing industry penetration.

TECHNICAL
    PRODUCTS GROUP

Our Technical Products Group is a leader in the global
    enclosures and thermal management markets, designing and
    manufacturing standard, modified, and custom enclosures that
    house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical
    components; thermal management products; and accessories. We
    have identified a target market of $30 billion. Our
    Technical Products Group focuses its business portfolio on four
    primary industries: Commercial and Industrial (55% of group
    sales), Telecom and Datacom (25% of group sales), Electronics
    (15% of group sales), and Networking (5% of group sales). The
    primary brand names for the Technical Products Group are:
    Hoffman

®

,
    Schroff

    Pentair Electronic
    Packaging

,
    Taunus

Products
    and related accessories of the Technical Products Group include
    metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks,
    backplanes, heat exchangers, and blowers. Applications served
    include industrial machinery, data communications, networking,
    telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical,
    security, defense, and general electronics.

Customers

Our Technical Products Group distributes its products through
    electrical and data contractors, electrical and electronic
    components distributors, and original equipment manufacturers.
    Information regarding significant customers in our Technical
    Products Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 14 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our Technical Products Group is not significantly impacted by
    seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the technical products markets can be intense,
    particularly in telecom and datacom markets, where product
    design, prototyping, global supply, price competition, and
    customer service are significant factors. Our Technical Products
    Group has continued to focus on cost control and improving
    profitability. Recent growth in the Technical Products Group is
    a result of acquisitions, overall market growth, new product
    development, continued channel penetration, growth in targeted
    market segments, and geographic expansion. Consolidation,
    globalization, and outsourcing are visible trends in the
    technical products marketplace and typically play to the
    strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier. We
    believe our Technical Products Group has the broadest array of
    enclosures products available for commercial and industrial uses.

RECENT
    DEVELOPMENTS

Growth
    of our business

We continually look at each of our businesses to determine
    whether they fit with our strategic vision. Our primary focus is
    on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities,
    especially in international markets. We seek growth through
    product and service innovation, market expansion, and
    acquisitions. Acquisitions have played an important part in the
    growth of our business, and we expect acquisitions will continue
    to be an important part of our future growth.

Acquisitions

On December 11, 2006 we entered into an agreement to
    acquire all of the share capital of Jung Pumpen GmbH, a
    German-based manufacturer of municipal and residential
    wastewater pumps and related products, subject to German Federal
    Cartel Office approval. The acquisition was completed on
    February 2, 2007 for approximately $227 million, net
    of cash acquired of $13 million, excluding transaction
    costs and subject to a post-closing net asset value adjustment.


On April 12, 2006, we acquired, as part of our Water Group,
    the assets of Geyer’s Manufacturing & Design Inc.
    and FTA Filtration, Inc. (together “Krystil Klear”),
    two privately-held companies, for $15.5 million in cash.
    Krystil Klear expands our industrial filtration product offering
    to include a full range of steel and stainless steel tanks which
    house filtration solutions. Goodwill recorded as part of the
    initial purchase price allocation was $9.2 million, all of
    which is tax deductible. We continue to evaluate the purchase
    price allocation for the Krystil Klear acquisition, including
    intangible assets, contingent liabilities, plant rationalization
    costs, and property, plant and equipment. We expect to revise
    the purchase price allocation as better information becomes
    available.

During 2006, we completed several other small acquisitions
    totaling $14.2 million in cash and notes payable, adding to
    both our Water and Technical Products Groups. Total goodwill
    recorded as part of the initial purchase price allocations was
    $7.9 million, of which $2.9 million is tax deductible.
    We continue to evaluate the purchase price allocations for these
    acquisitions and expect to revise the purchase price allocations
    as better information becomes available.

On December 1, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Technical
    Products Group, the McLean Thermal Management, Aspen Motion
    Technologies, and Electronic Solutions businesses from APW, Ltd.
    (collectively, “Thermal”) for $143.9 million,
    including a cash payment of $140.6 million and transaction
    costs of $3.3 million. These businesses provide thermal
    management solutions and integration services to the
    telecommunications, data communications, medical, and security
    markets. Final goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price
    allocation was $71.1 million, all of which is tax
    deductible. Final identifiable intangible assets acquired as
    part of the acquisition were $45.6 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as proprietary technology and
    customer relationships, of $23.1 million with a weighted
    average amortization period of approximately 12 years.

On February 23, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Water
    Group, certain assets of Delta Environmental Products, Inc. and
    affiliates (collectively, “DEP”), a privately-held
    company, for $10.3 million, including a cash payment of
    $10.0 million, transaction costs of $0.2 million, and
    debt assumed of $0.1 million. The DEP product line
    addressees the water and wastewater markets. Final goodwill
    recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was
    $7.2 million, all of which is tax deductible.

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of
    all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR, Inc.
    (“WICOR”) from Wisconsin Energy Corporation
    (“WEC”) for $874.7 million, including a cash
    payment of $871.1 million, transaction costs of
    $11.2 million, and debt assumed of $21.6 million, less
    a favorable final purchase price adjustment of
    $14.0 million and less cash acquired of $15.2 million.
    This includes an additional $0.4 million in transaction
    costs recorded in the first three quarters of 2005. WICOR
    manufactured water system, filtration, and pool equipment
    products primarily under the
    STA-RITE

Form 10-K.

Discontinued
    operations/divestitures

Effective after the close of business on October 2, 2004,
    we completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”). In
    January 2006, pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of
    our former Tools Group, we completed the repurchase of a
    manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China from BDK for
    approximately $5.7 million. We recorded no gain or loss on
    the repurchase. In March 2006, we completed an outstanding net
    asset value arbitration with BDK relating to the purchase price
    for the sale of our former Tools Group. The decision by the
    arbitrator constituted a final resolution of all disputes
    between BDK and us regarding the net asset value. We paid the
    final net asset value purchase price adjustment pursuant to the
    purchase agreement of $16.1 million plus interest of
    $1.1 million in March 2006, resulting in an incremental
    pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of
    $3.4 million, or $1.6 million net of tax. In the third
    quarter of 2006, we resolved a prior year tax item that resulted
    in a $1.4 million income tax benefit related to our former
    Tools Group.


In 2001, we completed the sale of our former Service Equipment
    businesses (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) to
    Clore Automotive, LLC. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we
    reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of
    $2.9 million related to exiting the remaining two
    facilities. In March 2006, we exited a leased facility from our
    former Service Equipment business resulting in a net cash
    outflow of $2.2 million and an immaterial gain from
    disposition.

    Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 3 of the Notes to

%

The $72.5 million increase in Water Group backlog was
    primarily due to better than anticipated fourth quarter 2006
    early buy orders in our pool business that are scheduled to ship
    in the first quarter of 2007, growth in Asian markets, and
    increased backlog for pumps used in municipal market
    applications. The $6.4 million decrease in Technical
    Products Group backlog reflected a decline in orders from the
    telecommunications market and data communications projects which
    have reached end-of-life. Due to the relatively short
    manufacturing cycle and general industry practice for the
    majority of our businesses, backlog, which typically represents
    approximately 30 days of shipments, is not deemed to be a
    significant item. A substantial portion of our revenues result
    from orders received and product sold in the same month. We
    expect that most of our backlog at December 31, 2006 will
    be filled in 2007.

Research
    and development

We conduct research and development activities in our own
    facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new
    products, product applications, and manufacturing processes.
    Research and development expenditures during 2006, 2005, and
    2004 were $58.1 million, $46.0 million, and
    $31.5 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7,
    and in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Raw
    materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of our
    products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel,
    electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies),
    and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of
    raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution
    through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are
    purchased on the open market, and the majority are available
    through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not
    experienced any significant work stoppages to-date due to
    shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments,
    principally price commitments, for the purchase of various
    component parts and raw materials and believe that it is
    unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated
    prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices
    are available for most materials for which long-term commitments
    exist, and we believe that the termination of any of these
    commitments would not have a material adverse effect on
    operations.

Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to
    market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these
    fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term
    agreements with escalator/de-escalator clauses. Prices for raw
    materials, such as metals and resins, may continue to trend
    higher in the future.


Intellectual
    property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. However, we do not regard
    our business as being materially dependent upon any single
    patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer
    relationship, trade mark, trade name, or brand name.

Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire
    or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with
    their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of
    patents, patent applications, and license agreements to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of December 31, 2006, we employed approximately
    14,800 people worldwide. Total employees in the United
    States were approximately 9,100, of whom approximately 900 are
    represented by six different trade unions having collective
    bargaining agreements. Generally, labor relations have been
    satisfactory.

Captive
    Insurance Subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by
    third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired
    businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain foreign
    operations, are established without regard to the availability
    of insurance.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and
    warnings before making an investment decision. If any of the
    risks described below actually occur, our business, financial
    condition, results of operations or prospects could be
    materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our
    securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your
    investment. You should also refer to other information set forth
    in this document.

Demand
    for our products will be affected by general economic
    conditions.

We compete globally in varied markets. Among these, the most
    significant are North American industrial and commercial markets
    (for both the Water and Technical Products Groups) and the North
    American residential market (for the Water Group). Economic
    conditions in the United States affect the robustness of our
    North American markets; important factors include the overall
    strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in
    the economy; industrial and municipal capital spending; the
    strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets;
    the age of existing housing stock; unemployment rates;
    availability of consumer financing; and, interest rates. New
    construction for residential housing and home improvement
    activity fell dramatically in 2006, which reduced revenue growth
    in our Water Group, especially in the pool and spa and pump
    markets we address. We cannot give any assurance that we will
    not continue to encounter


weakness in these markets. Further, while we attempt to minimize
    our exposure to economic or market fluctuations by serving a
    balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions, we cannot
    assure you that a significant or sustained downturn in a
    specific end market or geographic region would not have a
    material adverse effect on us.

Our
    businesses operate in highly competitive markets, so we may be
    forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs.

Our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of
    their respective markets. Competition may force us to cut prices
    or to incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete
    on the basis of product design, quality, availability,
    performance, customer service and price. Present or future
    competitors may have greater financial, technical or other
    resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected
    business or businesses. We cannot assure you that these and
    other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
    future results of operations.

Our
    inability to sustain consistent organic growth could adversely
    affect our financial performance.

In 2006 and 2005, our organic growth was generated in part from
    expanding international sales, entering new distribution
    channels, and introducing new products. To grow more rapidly
    than our end markets, we will have to continue to expand our
    geographic reach, further diversify our distribution channels,
    continue to introduce new products, and increase sales of
    existing products to our customer base. We may not be able to
    successfully meet those challenges, which could adversely affect
    our ability to sustain consistent organic growth. If we are
    unable to sustain consistent organic growth, we will be less
    likely to meet our stated revenue growth targets, which together
    with any resulting impact on our net income growth, would likely
    adversely affect the market price of our stock.

Our
    inability to complete or successfully complete and integrate
    acquisitions could adversely affect our financial
    performance.

A significant percentage of our net sales growth in 2006 and
    2005 was generated as a result of acquisitions completed in 2004
    or subsequent periods, including our acquisition of WICOR and
    the Thermal businesses. We may not be able to sustain this level
    of growth from acquisition activity in the future. We intend to
    continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions primarily in our
    current business segments, and we may consider acquisitions
    outside of these segments as well. Our ability to expand through
    acquisitions is subject to various risks, including the
    following:

•

increased competition for acquisitions, especially in the water
    industry;

•

higher acquisition prices;

•

lack of suitable acquisition candidates in targeted product or
    market areas;

•

diversion of management time and attention to acquisitions and
    acquired businesses;

•

inability to integrate acquired businesses effectively or
    profitably; and

•

inability to achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits
    from acquisitions.

Acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our
    operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters
    immediately following the acquisitions, while we attempt to
    integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our
    operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve
    the levels of profitability originally anticipated.

Material
    cost and other inflation could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

We are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a
    number of our businesses. We are striving for greater
    productivity improvements and implementing selective increases
    in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in base
    materials such as metals and other costs such as pension, health
    care and insurance. We also


are continuing to implement our excellence in operations
    initiatives in order to continuously reduce our costs. We cannot
    assure you, however, that these actions will be successful in
    managing our costs or increasing our productivity. Continued
    cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to generate cost
    savings or improve productivity may negatively impact our
    results of operations.

Seasonality
    of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our
    financial results.

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sales “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts. We cannot assure you that
    seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Intellectual
    property challenges may hinder product development and
    marketing.

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. Intellectual property
    protection, however, may not preclude competitors from
    developing products similar to ours or from challenging our
    names or products. Over the past few years, we have noticed an
    increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use
    conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a
    means to compete. Patent and trademark challenges increase our
    costs to develop, engineer and market our products.

Our
    results of operations may be negatively impacted by
    litigation.

Our business exposes us to potential litigation, especially
    product liability suits that are inherent in the design,
    manufacture, and sale of our products, such as the Horizon
    litigation discussed in ITEM 3 of this annual report on

Form 10-K.

While we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable
    product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will
    be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that
    this insurance will provide adequate protection against
    potential liabilities. In addition, we self-insure a portion of
    product liability claims. A series of successful claims against
    us could materially and adversely affect our product reputation,
    financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

The
    availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on
    our continued growth.

Our plans to continue growth in our chosen markets will require
    additional capital for future acquisitions, capital expenditures
    for existing businesses, growth of working capital, and
    continued international and regional expansion. In the past, we
    have financed our growth primarily through debt financing. Any
    significant future acquisitions will require us to expand our
    debt financing resources or to issue equity securities. Our
    financial results may be adversely affected if interest costs
    under our debt financings are higher than the income generated
    by acquisitions or other internal growth. In addition, future
    acquisitions could be dilutive to your equity investment if we
    issue additional stock to fund acquisitions. There can be no
    assurance that we will be able to issue equity securities or to
    obtain future debt financing at favorable terms. Without
    sufficient financing, we will not be able to pursue our growth
    strategy, which will limit our growth and revenues in the future.

Our
    international operations are subject to foreign market and
    currency fluctuation risks.

We expect the percentage of our sales outside of North America
    to increase in the future. Over the past few years, the
    economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do
    business have had slower growth than the U.S. economy. The
    European Union currently accounts for the majority of our
    foreign sales and income, in which our most significant European
    market is Germany. In addition, we have a significant and
    growing business in the Asia-Pacific area. We cannot predict how
    changing market conditions in these regions will impact our
    financial results.


We are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign
    currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results.
    As of December 31, 2006, we held immaterial positions in
    foreign exchange-forward contracts.

We are
    exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from
    operating a multinational business.

Sales outside of North America, including export sales from
    North American businesses, accounted for approximately 23% of
    our net sales in 2006. Further, most of our businesses obtain
    some raw materials and finished goods from foreign suppliers.
    Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic
    and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous
    countries. These risks include:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing
    requirements;

•

tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the
    U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on
    foreign earnings;

•

the possibility of terrorist action against us or our operations;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other
    restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in

non-U.S. labor

markets;

•

the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may
    be more difficult;

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations; and

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in
    countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

Our business success depends in part on our ability to
    anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We
    cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a
    material adverse effect on our international operations or on
    our business as a whole.

We are
    exposed to potential environmental liabilities and
    litigation.

Compliance with environmental regulations could require us to
    satisfy environmental liabilities, increase the cost of
    manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. We are
    subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
    regulations governing public and worker health and safety and
    the indoor and outdoor environment. Any violations of these laws
    by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that
    could harm our operating results and cause our business to
    suffer. We are also required to comply with various
    environmental laws and maintain permits, some of which are
    subject to discretionary renewal from time to time, for many of
    our businesses, and we could suffer if we are unable to renew
    existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may
    require.

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a number of
    environmental

clean-ups

relating to our current or former business units. We have
    disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and, in
    certain cases, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers. We
    may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing
    business units, as well as both divested and acquired businesses.

We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change
    or become more stringent over time or that our eventual
    environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.


Provisions
    of our Restated Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Minnesota
    law could deter takeover attempts.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under
    Minnesota law, and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent
    or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.

Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include
    provisions relating to the election, appointment and removal of
    directors, as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting
    requirements which could delay, prevent or make more difficult a
    merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control.
    In addition, our common share purchase rights could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us, which could deter some acquirers from making
    takeover proposals or tender offers. Also, the Minnesota
    Business Corporations Act contains control share acquisition and
    business combination provisions which could delay, prevent or
    make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
    other change of control. Our shareholders might view any such
    transaction as being in their best interests since the
    transaction could result in a higher stock price than the
    current market price for our common stock.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is in leased premises located in
    Golden Valley, Minnesota. We carry out our Water Group
    manufacturing operations at 24 plants located throughout the
    United States and at 19 plants located in 10 other countries. In
    addition, our Water Group has 67 distribution facilities and 17
    sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the
    world. We carry out our Technical Products Group manufacturing
    operations at 8 plants located throughout the United States and
    9 plants located in 7 other countries. In addition, our
    Technical Products Group has 11 distribution facilities and 31
    sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their
    purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential


impact on our consolidated financial position, results of
    operations, and cash flows for the proceedings and claims
    described in “Legal Proceedings” could change in the
    future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a small number of
    environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $5.6 million and
    $6.4 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a
    liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the
    claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing
    information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as
    additional information becomes available. We have not
    experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the
    severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal
    injury claims.

Horizon
    litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs,
    a class action, and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise
    Lines, Inc. (“Celebrity”) were brought against Essef
    Corporation (“Essef”) and certain of its subsidiaries
    prior to our acquisition of Essef in August 1999. The claims
    against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the
    allegation that Essef designed, manufactured, and marketed two
    sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the
    spa system on the Horizon cruise ship, and allegations that the
    spa and filters contained Legionnaire’s disease bacteria
    that infected certain passengers on cruises from April 1994
    through July 1994.

The individual and class claims by passengers were tried and
    resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the
    part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister
    company, Fantasia (together 30%). After expiration of post-trial
    appeals, we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of
    $7.0 million in the Horizon cases, plus interest of
    approximately $1.6 million, in January 2004. All of the
    personal injury cases have now been resolved through either
    settlement or judgment.


The only remaining unresolved claims in this case were those
    brought by Celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak.
    Celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and
    costs for prior litigation as well as

out-of-pocket

losses, lost profits, and loss of business enterprise value. On
    June 28, 2006, a jury returned a verdict against the Essef
    defendants in the total amount of $193.0 million for its
    claims for

out-of-pocket

expenses ($10.4 million), lost profits ($47.6 million)
    and lost enterprise value ($135.0 million). The verdict was
    exclusive of pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees.

On January 17, 2007, the Court ruled on our post-trial
    motions, granting judgment in our favor as a matter of law with
    respect to Celebrity’s claim for lost enterprise value
    ($135.0 million). The Court also granted a new trial with
    respect to lost profits ($47.6 million). In addition, the
    Court denied without prejudice our claim for contribution to
    reduce Celebrity’s recovery by 30% to account for its
    contributory negligence, with leave to renew the motion
    following retrial.

Celebrity’s claim for lost profits at trial amounted to
    approximately $60.3 million. We believe that actual lost
    profits suffered, if any, are substantially less. In a new
    trial, there remain questions of causation, contribution and
    proof of damages to be determined. We intend to vigorously
    defend against Celebrity’s claims. We cannot predict
    whether Celebrity will appeal the ruling on lost enterprise
    value, nor whether and to what extent Essef may eventually be
    found liable on Celebrity’s claims.

Several issues have not been decided by the Court, including
    whether Celebrity is entitled to recovery of its attorneys’
    fees and related costs in the passenger claims phase of the case
    ($4.1 million), and, with respect to pre-judgment interest,
    the length of the interest period and the rate of interest on
    any eventual judgment. We have assessed the impact of the ruling
    on our previously established reserves for this matter and,
    based on information available at this time, have not changed
    our reserves following this ruling, except to take into account
    quarterly interest accruals.

We believe that any judgment we pay in this matter would be
    tax-deductible in the year paid or in subsequent years. In
    addition to the impact of any loss on this matter on our
    earnings per share when recognized, we may need to borrow funds
    from our banks or other sources to pay any judgment finally
    determined after exhaustion of all appeals. We expect that we
    would have available adequate funds to allow us to do so, based
    on discussions with our lending sources and our estimates of the
    results of our business operations over the foreseeable future.

Stock
    Performance Graph

The following information under the caption “Stock
    Performance Graph” in this ITEM 5 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or
    14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to the
    liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference
    into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent we
    specifically incorporate it by reference into such a filing.

The following graph sets forth the cumulative total shareholder
    return on our common stock for the last five years, assuming the
    investment of $100 on December 31, 2001 and the
    reinvestment of all dividends since that date to
    December 31, 2006. The graph also contains for comparison
    purposes the S&P 500 Index and the S&P MidCap 400
    Index, assuming the same investment level and reinvestment of
    dividends.

By virtue of its market capitalization, Pentair is a component
    of the S&P MidCap 400 Index. On the basis of our size and
    diversity of businesses, we have not found a readily
    identifiable peer group. We believe the S&P MidCap 400
    Index is an appropriate comparison. We have evaluated other
    published indices, but have determined that the results are
    skewed by significantly larger companies included in the
    indices. We believe such a comparison would not be meaningful.

In December 2005, the Board of
    Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common
    stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25 million of our
    common stock. On July 28, 2006, the Board of Directors
    increased our repurchase authorization to $50 million, and
    on September 28, 2006, the Board of Directors further
    increased our repurchase authorization to $100 million. As
    of December 31, 2006, we had purchased
    1,986,026 shares for $59.4 million pursuant to these
    programs during 2006. In December 2006, the Board of Directors
    authorized the continuation of the repurchase program in 2007
    with a maximum dollar limit of $40.6 million. This
    authorization expires on December 31, 2007. As of
    February 16, 2007, we had not repurchased any additional
    shares under this plan and, accordingly, we have the authority
    in 2007 to repurchase shares up to a maximum dollar limit of
    $40.6 million. In 2005 and 2004, respectively, we
    repurchased 755,663 shares and 105,500 shares of our
    common stock under similar authorizations.

Effective January 1, 2002 we
    adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets. This standard requires goodwill and intangible assets
    deemed to have an indefinite life no longer be amortized. This
    standard did not require restatement of prior period amounts to
    be consistent with the current year presentation and therefore,
    we have not made any adjustments to the historical financial
    information presented. However, we have provided supplemental
    tax and diluted EPS information as we believe it is necessary to
    the understanding of our financial performance trend. Our
    accounting policy prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 142 was to amortize goodwill on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be
    benefited, principally between 25 and 40 years.

(2)

Calculated using a

13-month

average.

In 2004, we divested our Tools Group. Our financial statements
    have been restated to reflect the Tools Group as a discontinued
    operation for all periods presented. The 2004 results reflect a
    pre-tax gain on the sale of the Tools Group of $3.0 million
    ($6.0 million loss after tax).

In 2002, capital expenditures from discontinued operations
    included $23.0 million for the acquisition of a previously
    leased facility.


In 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, resulting in
    an increase to other assets and other noncurrent liabilities of
    $7.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and a
    cumulative transition adjustment of $6.7 million in OCI.
    The transition adjustment relates to our hedging activities
    through December 31, 2000. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 133, financial instruments designated as
    hedges were not recorded in the financial statements, but cash
    flows from such contracts were recorded as adjustments to
    earnings as the hedged items affected earnings.

In 2001, cost of goods sold included $1.0 million related
    to the 2001 restructuring charge for our Technical Products
    segment.

In 2000, we discontinued our Equipment segment (Century Mfg.
    Co./Lincoln Automotive and Lincoln Industrial businesses). Our
    financial statements have been restated to reflect the Equipment

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company
    comprised of two operating segments: Water and Technical
    Products. Our Water Group is a global leader in providing
    innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement,
    storage, treatment, and enjoyment of water. Our Technical
    Products Group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal
    management markets, designing and manufacturing standard,
    modified, and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive
    electronics and electrical components; thermal management
    products; and accessories. In 2007, we expect our Water Group
    and Technical Products Group to generate approximately 70% and
    30% of total revenues, respectively.

Our Water Group has progressively become a more important part
    of our business portfolio with sales increasing from
    approximately $125 million in 1995 to approximately
    $2.2 billion in 2006. We believe the water industry is
    structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for
    clean water and the large global market size (of which we have
    identified a target market totaling $60 billion). Our
    vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products
    and systems used in the movement, storage, treatment, and
    enjoyment of water.

Our Technical Products Group operates in a large global market
    with significant potential for growth in industry segments such
    as defense, security, medical, and networking. We believe we
    have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial
    distribution network in North America and the highest enclosures
    brand recognition in the industry in North America. From
    mid-2001 through 2003, the Technical Products Group experienced
    significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely
    reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial
    markets and over-capacity and weak demand in the datacom and
    telecom markets. From 2004 through 2006, sales volumes increased
    due to the addition of new distributors, new products, and
    higher demand in targeted markets. In addition, through the
    success of our Pentair Integrated Management System
    (“PIMS”) initiatives, we have increased Technical
    Products’ segment operating margins to our goal of 15% and
    achieved 17 consecutive quarters of

year-over-year

operating margin expansion.

Key
    Trends and Uncertainties

The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial
    performance in 2006 and will likely impact our results in the
    future:

•

The housing market and new pool starts slowed dramatically in
    the first quarter of 2006 and shrank in the last three quarters
    of the year. We believe that construction of new homes and new
    pools starts in North America affects approximately 25% of the
    sales of our Water Group, especially for our pool and spa
    businesses. The impact of this downturn reduced our expected
    revenues in 2006 and will likely continue to have an uncertain
    impact on our revenues in 2007.

•

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sales “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and
    weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts.

•

We expect our operations to continue to benefit from our PIMS
    initiatives which include strategy deployment; lean enterprise
    with special focus on sourcing and supply management, cash flow
    management, and lean operations; and IGNITE, our process to
    drive organic growth.


•

We are experiencing material cost and other inflation in a
    number of our businesses. We are striving for greater
    productivity improvements and implementing selective increases
    in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in base
    materials such as metals and other costs such as pensions,
    health care and insurance.

•

We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% of our net income. Free cash flow,
    which we define as cash flow from operating activities less
    capital expenditures, including both continuing and discontinued
    operations, plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment,
    exceeded $200 million for the fourth consecutive year in
    2005 and was $181 million in 2006. See our discussion of

Other financial measures

under the caption
    “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report.

•

We experienced unfavorable foreign currency effects on net sales
    in the first quarter of 2006 and favorable foreign currency
    effects in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2006.
    Overall, we experienced favorable foreign currency effect on net
    sales in 2006. Our currency effect is primarily for the
    U.S. dollar against the euro, which may or may not trend
    favorably in the future.

•

The effective tax rate for 2006 was 28.1% due in part to
    favorable resolution of prior tax years and higher utilization
    of foreign tax credits. We continue to actively pursue
    initiatives to reduce our effective tax rate. The tax rate in
    any quarter can be affected positively or negatively by
    adjustments that are required to be reported in the specific
    quarter of resolution. We expect our full year effective tax
    rate in 2007 to be between 35% and 36%.

Outlook

In 2007, our operating objectives include the following:

•

Continue to drive operating excellence through lean enterprise
    initiatives, with special focus on sourcing and supply
    management, cash flow management, and lean operations;

•

Continue the integration of acquisitions and realize identified
    synergistic opportunities;

•

Continue proactive talent development, particularly in
    international management and other key functional areas;

•

Achieve organic sales growth (in excess of market growth rates),
    particularly in international markets; and

•

Continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our
    existing platforms in our Water and Technical Products Groups.

The ability to achieve our operating objectives will depend, to
    a certain extent, on factors outside our control. See “Risk
    Factors” under Part I of this report.

The 7.1 percent increase in consolidated net sales in
    2006 from 2005 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume due to our acquisitions, primarily
    the December 1, 2005 acquisition of the McLean Thermal
    Management, Aspen Motion Technologies, and Electronic Solutions
    businesses from APW, Ltd. (collectively,
    “Thermal”); and


•

organic sales growth of approximately two percent (excluding the
    effects of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange), which
    includes selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases.

The 29.3 percent increase in consolidated net sales in
    2005 from 2004 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our July 31, 2004
    acquisition of WICOR, February 23, 2005 acquisition of DEP
    and December 1, 2005 acquisition of Thermal;

•

pro forma sales growth from continuing operations of
    approximately six percent, assuming we had acquired WICOR at the
    beginning of 2004, excluding the Thermal acquisition, and
    excluding the effects of foreign currency translation;

•

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

Water

The 1.1 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2006
    from 2005 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales growth of approximately one percent (excluding
    foreign currency exchange), which includes selective increases
    in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

strong pump sales in our commercial markets;

•

increased sales in Europe driven by higher pump and filtration
    sales;

•

sales growth in emerging markets in Asia-Pacific;

•

sales growth of filtration products in our foodservice,
    commercial, and industrial markets; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales of pool and spa products due to softening of the
    U.S. residential housing market and inventory draw-downs by
    pool distribution customers to position themselves for the
    softening market.

The 36.3 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2005
    from 2004 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our July 31, 2004
    acquisition of WICOR and our February 23, 2005 acquisition
    of DEP;

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases;

•

sales growth on a pro forma basis (assuming we had acquired
    WICOR at the beginning of 2004 and excluding favorable foreign
    currency exchange) of approximately four percent for the year;

•

an increase in sales of pool and spa equipment due to market
    share gains, favorable weather conditions, and successful early
    buy programs;

•

growth in international markets; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.


Technical
    Products

The 22.6 percent increase in Technical Products segment
    sales in 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume due to our December 1, 2005
    acquisition of the Thermal businesses;

•

organic sales growth of approximately six percent (excluding
    acquisitions and foreign currency exchange), which includes
    selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases:

•

increased sales in our commercial and industrial markets;

•

increased sales in European test and measurement and telecom
    markets;

•

higher sales in Asia driven by key OEM programs in China and
    stronger sales in the telecom and semiconductor markets in
    Japan; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales to North American telecom businesses due to weaker
    markets conditions, customer consolidation and certain key
    projects reaching

end-of-life; and

•

lower sales in data markets related to OEM projects that reached

end-of-life

or were transitioned to our Asian operations.

The 14.0 percent increase in Technical Products segment
    sales in 2005 from 2004 was primarily the result of:

•

growth in new products including Advanced Telecommunications
    Computing Architecture (ATCA), slide rails for datacom
    applications and a new cabinet line targeted toward the telecom
    and electronic markets;

•

improved service and delivery resulting in increased sales
    volume in North America with strong sales in commercial and
    medical industry segments;

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases;

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our December 1, 2005
    acquisition of the Thermal businesses;

•

higher sales in China; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The 0.1 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a
    percent of sales in 2006 from 2005 was primarily the result
    of:

•

inflationary increases related to material, labor and freight
    costs;

•

increased reserves for inventory and warranty expenses in our
    Water Group due to the effects of the U.S. residential
    housing market downturn on the spa and bath markets and new pool
    starts, and also due to inventory reserves established for pump
    motors that we no longer expect to need;

•

lower sales of pool and spa products related to the
    U.S. residential housing market downturn; and

•

operating inefficiencies related to product moves and plant
    consolidations.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases;


•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and
    supply management practices;

•

cost leverage from increased sales volume in our Technical
    Products Group; and

•

absence of

start-up

costs in new water facilities (incurred in 2005).

The 0.1 percentage point increase in gross profit as a
    percent of sales in 2005 from 2004 was primarily the result
    of:

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean
    enterprise and supply management practices;

•

cost leverage from our increase in sales volume; and

•

synergy benefits, net of integration costs, related to the
    acquisition of the former WICOR businesses.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

inflationary cost increases in our Water and Technical Products
    Groups;

•

lower margins associated with our July 31, 2004 acquisition
    of WICOR; and

•

operating inefficiencies related to WICOR product moves, plant

    of:

•

higher selling, general and administrative expense to fund
    investments in future growth in our Water Group, including
    personnel and business infrastructure, with an emphasis on
    growth in our international markets; and

•

severance costs in our Water Group and at our corporate
    headquarters, and increased reserves for accounts receivable due
    to the effects of the U.S. residential housing market
    downturn on the spa and bath markets and new pool starts in our
    Water Group.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

cost leverage from our increase in sales volume in the Technical
    Products Group.

The 0.3 percentage point decrease in SG&A expense as
    a percent of sales in 2005 from 2004 was primarily the result
    of:

•

favorable cost leverage from the combined larger company of
    Pentair and the former WICOR businesses.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

adoption of SFAS 123R which requires us to record expense
    for the fair value of stock-based compensation;

•

investments made to support future growth; and

•

higher amortization of intangibles due to acquisitions and
    amortization of a tax strategy-based investment.

    of:

•

increases in interest rates;

•

higher average outstanding debt in 2006 primarily as a result of
    the acquired Thermal businesses and an increase in
    inventory; and

•

incremental interest expense related to the payments made in
    connection with the final resolution of the net asset value
    dispute with The Black and Decker Corporation (“BDK”)
    in the first quarter of 2006.


These increases were partially offset by:

•

favorable adjustments to interest expense related to the
    favorable settlement of prior years’ federal tax returns in
    the second and third quarters of 2006.

The 20.9 percent increase in interest expense from
    continuing operations in 2005 from 2004 was primarily the result
    of:

•

a portion of interest expense in 2004 being allocated to
    discontinued operations for our former Tools Group versus all
    the interest expense in 2005 being attributed to continuing
    operations; and

•

higher interest rates in 2005.

higher effective tax rate in 2005 due to the non-deductibility
    of certain SFAS 123R expenses related to stock options.

We expect our full year effective tax rate in 2007 to be between
    35% and 36%. We will continue to pursue tax rate reduction
    opportunities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures,
    equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, and dividend
    payments are generally funded from cash generated from
    operations, availability under existing committed revolving
    credit facilities, and in certain instances, public and private
    debt and equity offerings. In 2006, we invested $29 million
    in acquisitions, repurchased $59 million of our stock, paid
    $57 million in dividends, and decreased our debt by
    $9 million.

We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal
    demand in a number of markets within our Water Group. End-user
    demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at
    seasonal highs from April


to August. The magnitude of the sales spike is partially
    mitigated by employing some advance sales “early buy”
    programs (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Operating
    activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $231.6 million in
    2006, or $16.2 million lower compared with the same period
    in 2005. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities
    was due primarily to working capital increases related to
    increased inventory levels and decreases in various accruals.
    The increase in days inventory on hand as of December 31,
    2006 compared to December 31, 2005 was attributable to
    increased inventory levels to support product moves and plant
    rationalizations, inventory to support product sourced from low
    cost countries, higher value of inventories due to rising raw
    material input costs, and due to the purchase of additional
    submersible pump motors for competitive reasons. In the future,
    we expect our working capital ratios to improve as we complete
    our facility rationalization activities and capitalize on our
    PIMS initiatives.

Cash provided by operating activities was $247.9 million in
    2005, or $16.2 million lower compared with the same period
    in 2004. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities
    was due to working capital increases related to increased sales
    volume, the rationalization of Water Group operations, and
    increases in various customer rebates. The increased days of
    sales in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005
    compared to December 31, 2004 was the result of the
    differences in sales terms offered by the former WICOR business
    compared to the terms offered by our former Tools Group and the
    sale of approximately a $22.0 million interest in a pool of
    accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution in
    2004. The increased days inventory on hand as of
    December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 was
    driven by the increased inventory levels attributable to
    increased sourcing out of Asia, higher value of inventories due
    to rising raw material input costs, and inventory redundancies
    associated with the

ramp-up

of
    new facilities and the wind-down of old facilities.

Cash provided by operating activities was $264.1 million in
    2004, or $1.2 million higher compared with the same period
    in 2003. The increase in net cash provided by operating
    activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net
    income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory
    builds to support customers during product transfers and plant
    consolidation activities in Water. The WICOR acquisition also
    increased our working capital ratios, primarily inventory days.

In December 2006 and 2004, we sold approximately
    $30.0 million and $22.0 million, respectively, of
    accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution to
    mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk because we did
    not offer or the customer did not take advantage of the early
    pay discounts and to provide additional financing capacity. In
    compliance with SFAS No. 140,

Accounting for
    Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
    of Liabilities

, sales of accounts receivable are reflected
    as a reduction of accounts receivable in our Consolidated
    Balance Sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows
    from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. In 2006, a loss in the amount of $0.8 million
    related to the sale of accounts receivable is included in the
    line item

Gain on sale of assets, net

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income. In 2004, no gain or loss was
    recorded as the estimated present value of the receivables sold
    approximated the carrying amount.


Investing
    activities

Capital expenditures in 2006, 2005, and 2004 were
    $51.1 million, $62.5 million and $48.9 million
    (including $43.1 million for continuing operations),
    respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2007
    to be approximately $70 to $80 million, primarily for
    capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing
    facilities, implementation of a unified business systems
    infrastructure in Europe, new product development, and general
    maintenance capital.

On April 12, 2006, we acquired, as part of our Water Group,
    the assets of Geyer’s Manufacturing & Design Inc.
    and FTA Filtration, Inc. (together “Krystil Klear”),
    two privately held companies, for $15.5 million in cash.
    Krystil Klear expands our industrial filtration product offering
    to include a full range of steel and stainless steel tanks which
    house filtration solutions.

During 2006, we completed several other small acquisitions
    totaling $14.2 million in cash and notes payable, adding to
    both our Water and Technical Products Groups.

In January 2006, pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale
    of our former Tools Group, we completed the repurchase of a
    manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China from BDK for
    approximately $5.7 million. We recorded no gain or loss on
    the repurchase. In March 2006, we completed an outstanding net
    asset value arbitration with BDK relating to the purchase price
    for the sale of our former Tools Group. The decision by the
    arbitrator constituted a final resolution of all disputes
    between BDK and us regarding the net asset value. We paid the
    final net asset value purchase price adjustment pursuant to the
    purchase agreement of $16.1 million plus interest of
    $1.1 million in March 2006, resulting in an incremental
    pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of
    $3.4 million or $1.6 million net of tax. In the third
    quarter of 2006, we resolved a prior year tax item that resulted
    in a $1.4 million income tax benefit related to our former
    Tools Group. Also in March 2006, we exited a leased facility
    from our former Service Equipment business resulting in a net
    cash outflow of $2.2 million and an immaterial gain from
    disposition.

During 2006, we made investments in and loans to certain joint
    ventures in the amount of $7.5 million.

Cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of
    $17.1 million in 2005 was primarily related to the sale of
    three facilities for our Water Group.

On December 1, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Technical
    Products Group, the Thermal businesses from APW for
    approximately $143.9 million, including a cash payment of
    $140.6 million and transaction costs of $3.3 million.
    These businesses provide thermal management solutions and
    integration services to the telecommunications, data
    communications, medical and security markets.

On February 23, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Water
    Group, certain assets of DEP, a privately held company, for
    $10.3 million, including a cash payment of
    $10.0 million, transaction costs of $0.2 million, plus
    debt assumed of $0.1 million. The DEP product line
    addresses the water and wastewater markets and is part of our
    Water Group.

In the third quarter 2005, we paid $10.4 million in
    post-closing purchase price adjustments related to the October
    2004 sale of our former Tools Group to BDK.

In April 2005, we sold our interest in the stock of LN Holdings
    Corporation for cash consideration of $23.6 million,
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of $5.2 million and an after
    tax gain of $3.3 million. The terms of the sale agreement
    established two escrow accounts totaling $14 million to be
    used for payment of any potential adjustments to the purchase
    price, transaction expenses, and indemnification for certain
    losses such as environmental claims. In December 2005, we
    received $0.2 million from the escrow accounts which
    increased our gain from the sale. During 2006 we received
    $1.2 million from the escrow accounts which also increased
    our gain from the sale. Any remaining escrow balances are to be
    distributed by April 2008 to the former shareholders in
    accordance with their ownership percentages. Any funds received
    from settlement of escrows in future periods will be accounted
    for as additional gain on the sale of this interest.

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of
    all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR from Wisconsin
    Energy Corporation for $874.7 million, including a cash
    payment of $871.1 million, transaction costs of
    $11.2 million, and debt assumed of $21.6 million, less
    a favorable final purchase price adjustment of


$14.0 million, and less cash acquired of
    $15.2 million. This includes an additional
    $0.4 million in transaction costs recorded in the first
    three quarters of 2005.

On April 5, 2004, we acquired all of the remaining stock of
    the Tools Group’s Asian joint venture for
    $21.8 million in cash, $6.4 million of which was paid
    following the sale of the Tools Group. The level of return on
    sales targets achieved in the second quarter of 2004 required a
    payment of $0.9 million, which was recorded as an increase
    to goodwill. The acquisition included cash acquired of
    $6.2 million and debt assumed of $9.0 million. The
    investment in the Tools Group’s Asian joint venture
    business was sold as part of the Tools Group to BDK.

During 2004, we paid $3.9 million in purchase price
    adjustments related to the December 31, 2003 acquisition of
    Everpure. The adjustment primarily related to the final
    determination of closing date net assets. We also paid
    $2.3 million for acquisition fees which were primarily
    related to the Everpure acquisition.

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we
    completed the sale of our Tools Group to BDK for approximately
    $796.8 million in cash, including a $21.8 million
    interim net asset value increase, subject to post-closing
    adjustments.

Financing
    activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $117.8 million,
    $43.8 million and $137.8 million in 2006, 2005 and
    2004, respectively. Financing activities consisted primarily of
    draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to
    fund our operations in the normal course of business, dividend
    payments, share repurchases, and cash received from stock option
    exercises.

We have a multi-currency revolving Credit Facility (the
    “Credit Facility”) of $800 million expiring on
    March 4, 2010. We are authorized to sell short-term
    commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under
    the Credit Facility. We use the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had $208.9 million of commercial
    paper outstanding that matures within 49 days. All of the
    commercial paper was classified as long-term as we have the
    intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a
    long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

In March 2005, we amended and restated our multi-currency
    revolving Credit Facility, increasing the size of the facility
    from $500 million to $800 million with a term of five
    years. The interest rate on the loans under the
    $800 million Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest
    rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit
    ratings.

Effective following the close of business on July 31, 2004,
    we completed the acquisition of WICOR. We funded the payment of
    the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR
    acquisition with an $850 million committed line of credit
    (“the Bridge Facility”) and through additional
    borrowings available under our existing Credit Facility. The
    interest rate on the Bridge Facility and loans under the Credit
    Facility during the period of the Bridge Facility was LIBOR plus
    1.375%.

On October 4, 2004, we received approximately
    $796.8 million of proceeds from the sale of our Tools Group
    to BDK. As required under the terms of the Bridge Facility, we
    used the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and additional
    borrowings under the Credit Facility to pay off the Bridge
    Facility. Following payment of the Bridge Facility and based on
    our existing credit ratings, the interest rate on loans under
    the Credit Facility decreased to LIBOR plus 1.125%.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of
    December 31, 2006.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $25 million of
    uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had drawn
    $14.0 million in borrowings as of December 31, 2006.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

Long-Term Debt

Current Rating

Rating Agency

Rating

Outlook

Standard & Poor’s

BBB

Stable

Moody’s

Baa3

Stable


We believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial
    outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure
    or cost of debt. A credit rating is a current opinion of the
    creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
    financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations,
    or a specific financial program. The credit rating takes into
    consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or
    other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes
    into account the currency in which the obligation is
    denominated. The ratings outlook also highlights the potential
    direction of a short or long-term rating. It focuses on
    identifiable events and short-term trends that cause ratings to
    be placed under observation by the respective Rating Agencies. A
    change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is
    inevitable. Prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no
    immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of
    debt.

We issue short-term commercial paper notes that are currently
    not rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.
    Even though our short-term commercial paper is unrated, we
    believe a downgrade in our long-term debt rating could have a
    negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated
    commercial paper.

We do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long-term
    debt by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
    would substantially affect our ability to access the long term
    debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions,
    the amount, timing and pricing of new borrowings could be
    adversely affected. If both of our long-term debt ratings were
    downgraded to below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the
    term debt capital markets would be reduced. In the event of a
    downgrade of our long-term debt rating, the cost of borrowing
    and fees payable under our Credit Facility and $35 million
    private placement fixed rate note could increase. While the
    Credit Facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit
    ratings, we do not have any agreements under which the
    obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade.

As of December 31, 2006, our capital structure consisted of
    $744.1 million in total indebtedness and
    $1,670.0 million in shareholders’ equity. The ratio of

debt-to-total

capital at December 31, 2006 was 30.8% , compared with
    32.6% at December 31, 2005. Our targeted

debt-to-total

capital ratio is 40% or less.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support
    working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest
    and service debt, and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order
    to meet these cash requirements, we intend to use available cash
    and internally generated funds, and to borrow under our
    committed and uncommitted credit facilities.

We paid dividends in 2006 of $56.6 million, compared with
    $53.1 million in 2005 and $43.1 million in 2004. We
    anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a
    quarterly basis.

In December 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar
    limit of $25 million of our common stock. On July 28,
    2006, the Board of Directors increased our repurchase
    authorization to $50 million, and on September 28,
    2006, the Board of Directors further increased our repurchase
    authorization to $100 million. As of December 31,
    2006, we had purchased 1,986,026 shares for
    $59.4 million pursuant to these programs during 2006. The
    Board of Directors authorized the continuation of the repurchase
    program in 2007 with a maximum dollar limit of
    $40.6 million. This authorization expires on
    December 31, 2007. As of February 16, 2007, we had not
    repurchased any additional shares under this plan and,
    accordingly, we have the authority in 2007 to repurchase shares
    up to a maximum dollar limit of $40.6 million. In 2005 and
    2004, respectively, we repurchased 755,663 shares and
    105,500 shares of our common stock under similar
    authorizations.

In addition to the summary of significant contractual
    obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on
    outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2006,
    variable interest rate debt, including the effects of derivative
    financial instruments, was $247.9 million at a weighted
    average interest rate of 5.7%.

We expect to make contributions in the range of $15 million
    to $20 million to our pension plans in 2007. The 2007
    expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding
    requirements.

Other
    financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based
    upon operating, investing, and financing classifications
    included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also
    measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income. We
    have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of net income. Free cash
    flow and conversion of net income are non-GAAP financial
    measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We
    believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are
    important measures of operating performance because they provide
    us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from
    operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt. In
    addition, free cash flow and conversion of net income are used
    as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives.
    Our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may
    not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
    companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash
    flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash
    flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities:

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a small number of
    environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $5.6 million and
    $6.4 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Stand-by
    letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly for contracts
    and bids involving municipal pump products, we are required to
    commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit to secure our performance to third parties under
    self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding value of these
    instruments totaled $59.6 million and $38.8 million,
    respectively.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently
    adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be
    adopted in the future.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. Our
    significant accounting policies are more fully described in
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the
    application of significant judgment by management in selecting
    the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
    By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our
    historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our
    observance of trends in the industry, and information available
    from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an
    accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected would have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.


Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment
    of Goodwill

The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated
    using a discounted cash flow approach. The test for impairment
    requires us to make several estimates about projected future
    cash flows and appropriate discount rates. If these estimates
    change, we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill. During
    the fourth quarter of 2006, we completed our annual impairment
    test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment
    loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
    value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets
    held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that
    fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets.
    The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future
    cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
    consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from
    actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
    assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount
    rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels, and
    health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated
    annually and are disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 11 to the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these
    assumptions will affect pension expense.

In December 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that we
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined
    benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in
    our 2006 year-end balance sheet, with changes in the funded
    status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in
    which they occur.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount
    rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to
    payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our
    U.S. plans of 6.00% in 2006 and 5.75% in 2005 and 2004. The
    discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 2.00% to 5.15%
    in 2006, 2.00% to 4.90% in 2005 and 2.00% to 5.25% in 2004.
    There are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount
    rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2007.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2006 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2005 and 2004. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices. In 2006, the pension plan assets
    yielded a return of 12.3%, compared to returns of 4.2% in 2005
    and 17.6% in 2004. In 2006, our expected return on plan assets
    was lower than our actual return on plan assets while in 2005
    our expected return on plan assets was higher than our actual
    return on plans assets. The significant difference between our
    expected return on plan assets compared to our actual return on
    plan assets in 2005 was primarily attributable to the
    fluctuations


of our common stock during 2005 which approximates 10% of the
    plan assets. There are no known or anticipated changes in our
    return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2007.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

See ITEM 8, Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information regarding pension
    plans.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market
    risk

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We
    are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative
    financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of
    these risks. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are
    major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of
    credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than
    trading purposes. The major accounting policies and utilization
    of these instruments is described more fully in ITEM 8,
    Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of
    long-term debt (including current portion), short-term
    borrowing, interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward
    contracts. The net market value of these financial instruments
    combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument
    position. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31,
    2005, the net financial instrument position was a liability of
    $753.6 million and $769.0 million, respectively.

Interest
    rate risk

Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2006 was primarily comprised of debt
    predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars (97%). This debt
    portfolio is comprised of 53% fixed-rate debt and 47%
    variable-rate debt, not considering the effects of our interest
    rate swaps. Taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap
    agreement we entered with an effective date of April 2006, our
    debt portfolio is comprised of 67% fixed-rate debt and 33%
    variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different
    impacts on the fixed and variable-rate portions of our debt
    portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of
    the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position
    but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change
    in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio
    impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact
    the net financial instrument position.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio,
    including the interest rate swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2006, a 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates would result in a $2.5 million
    increase or decrease in interest incurred.

Foreign
    currency risk

We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates because some sales transactions, and the
    assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries, are
    denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro. We held
    immaterial positions in foreign exchange-forward contracts as of
    December 31, 2006. We do not expect the effect of foreign
    exchange rates to have a material impact on our operations.


ITEM 8.  FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the
    Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
    and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
    subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
    reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
    believes that, as of December 31, 2006, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report
    on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting for December 31, 2006.
    That attestation report is set forth immediately following the
    report of Deloitte & Touche LLP on the financial
    statements included herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
    Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.:

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying management’s report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on
    criteria established in

Internal Control —
    Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the “COSO
    Framework”). The Company’s management is responsible
    for maintaining effective internal control over financial
    reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is
    to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s Board of Directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“generally accepted accounting principles”).
    A company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in the COSO
    Framework. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the criteria
    established in the COSO Framework.


We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at ITEM 15 as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2006, of the Company, and our
    report dated February 26, 2007, expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph
    relating to the Company’s changes in its method of
    accounting for defined benefit pension and postretirement
    benefit plans in 2006 and stock-based compensation in 2005.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the
    Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows, and changes in
    shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2006. Our audits also included
    the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    ITEM 15. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company at December 31, 2006 and 2005, and the results of
    its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in
    the period ended December 31, 2006, in conformity with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement
    schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated
    financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all
    material respects, the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated
    financial statements, in 2006, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for defined benefit pension and postretirement
    benefit plans and as discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to the
    consolidated financial statements, in 2005, the Company changed
    its method of accounting for stock-based compensation.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the
    criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated
    Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
    the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 26,
    2007, expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s
    assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on
    the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements

1.  Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31. We report our interim
    quarterly periods on a

13-week

basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and

non-U.S.,

that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own 20% to
    50% of the voting stock or have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies of
    the investee are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting and, as a result, our share of the earnings or losses
    of such equity affiliates is included in the statement of
    income. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in
    which Pentair has less than a 20% ownership interest and we do
    not have the ability to exercise significant influence. These
    investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (GAAP) requires us to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Due to
    the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual
    results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts
    that could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting
    policies that require our most significant estimates and
    judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including
    goodwill; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in
    making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue
    recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has
    been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery has occurred
    (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to
    the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold
    other than warranty obligations in the normal, ordinary course
    of business. In the event significant post-shipment obligations
    were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until
    substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Sales
    returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly with our
    customers. Revenue from a transaction is recognized only if our
    price is fixed and determinable at the date of sale; the
    customer has paid or is obligated to pay; the customer’s
    obligation would not be changed in the event of theft, physical
    destruction, or damage of the product; the customer has economic
    substance apart from our Company; we do not have significant
    obligations for future performance to directly bring about
    resale of the product by the customer; and the amount of returns
    can reasonably be estimated.

In general, our return policy allows for customer returns only
    upon our authorization. Goods returned must be product we
    continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of
    custom or modified goods are normally not allowed.

At the time of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect
    of returns. Estimated sales returns include consideration of
    historical sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical
    sales return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type
    of customer, and a projection of this experience into the future.


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

Pricing
    and sales incentives

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
    and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements,
    promotions, and other volume-based incentives at the later of
    the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered.
    Sales incentives given to our customers are recorded as a
    reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable
    benefit for the goods or services in exchange for the
    consideration and (2) we can reasonably estimate the fair
    value of the benefit received. The following represents a
    description of our pricing arrangements, promotions, and other
    volume-based incentives:

Pricing
    arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers, and we
    record sales at the agreed upon net selling price. However, one
    of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a
    percentage of the original purchase price if they can
    demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM customer. At the time of
    sale, we estimate the anticipated refund to be paid based on
    historical experience and reduce sales for the probable cost of
    the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a
    reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as
    cooperative advertising. Under our cooperative advertising
    programs, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of
    sales as an allowance that may be used to advertise and promote
    our products. The customer is not required to provide evidence
    of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the cost of this
    cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The cost of this
    program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based
    incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front
    with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer
    achieves a specified cumulative level of sales or sales
    increase. Under these incentive programs, at the time of sale,
    we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on
    forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least
    monthly, for each customer and sales are reduced for the
    anticipated cost of the rebate. If the forecasted sales for a
    customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect
    the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

There have been no material accounting revisions for
    revenue-recognition related estimates.

Shipping
    and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
    recorded in

Net sales

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by
    Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

Cost of goods sold

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Cash
    equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities
    of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade
    receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts, reducing our
    receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from
    our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience,
    current trends, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic
    credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition.
    We generally do not require collateral. No customer receivable
    balances exceeded 10% of total net receivable balances as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.

In December 2006, we entered into a one-year Accounts Receivable
    Purchase Agreement whereby designated customer accounts
    receivable may be sold without recourse to a third-party
    financial institution on a revolving basis. These receivables
    consisted of specific invoices that were assigned and subject to
    a filed security


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

interest. Providing collections and claims services, we act as
    the agent for the third-party. Following the initial settlement
    period, we are required to transfer payments and make
    adjustments to invoice amounts on the assigned receivables to
    the third-party on a monthly basis. We are also required to
    maintain trade credit insurance on the sold receivables.
    Receivable sales could occur on the settlement date or as the
    third-party permits, up to a maximum total outstanding amount of
    $30 million, with the ability to make additional sales as
    sold receivables are repaid.

As of December 31, 2006, we had sold approximately
    $30.0 million of accounts receivable to a third-party
    financial institution to mitigate accounts receivable
    concentration risk because the customer did not take advantage
    of the early pay discounts and to provide additional financing
    capacity. In compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 140,

Accounting for
    Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments
    of Liabilities

, (“SFAS 140”) sales of
    accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts
    receivable in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the proceeds
    are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2006, a loss in the
    amount of $0.8 million related to the sale of accounts
    receivable is included in the line item

Gain on sale of
    assets, net

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

In December 2004, we entered into a one-year Accounts Receivable
    Purchase Agreement whereby designated customer accounts
    receivable could be sold without recourse to a third-party
    financial institution on a revolving basis. These receivables
    consisted of specific invoices that were assigned and subject to
    a filed security interest. Providing collections and claims
    services, we acted as the agent for the third-party. Following
    the initial settlement period, we were required to transfer
    payments and make adjustments to invoice amounts on the assigned
    receivables to the third-party on a monthly basis. We were also
    required to maintain trade credit insurance on the sold
    receivables. Receivable sales could have occurred on the
    settlement date or as the third-party permitted, up to a maximum
    total outstanding amount of $30 million, with the ability
    to make additional sales as sold receivables were repaid. The
    Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement was not renewed in 2005.

As of December 31, 2004, we had sold an approximate
    $22.0 million interest in our pool of accounts receivable
    to a third-party financial institution to mitigate the credit
    risk associated with the receivable balance of a large customer
    because we did not offer early pay discounts. In compliance with
    SFAS 140, sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a
    reduction of accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from
    operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash
    Flows. As the estimated present value of the receivables sold
    approximated the carrying amount, no gain or loss was recorded
    in 2004.

Inventories

Beginning in the fourth quarter, inventories are stated at the
    lower of cost or market with substantially all costed using the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) method and with an insignificant amount of
    inventories located outside the United States costed using a
    moving average method which approximates FIFO. Prior to the
    fourth quarter 2006, inventories located in the United States
    were costed using the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) and FIFO methods, and inventories of foreign
    based subsidiaries were costed primarily using the FIFO method
    with a smaller amount of inventories costed using the LIFO and
    moving average methods.

Change
    in accounting principle

Prior to October 1, 2006, inventories in the United States
    were costed using both the LIFO and FIFO methods, and
    inventories outside the United States were costed primarily
    using the FIFO methods with smaller amounts of inventory using
    the LIFO and moving average methods. Effective that date, we
    elected to change our method of accounting to cost all
    inventories previously costed using the LIFO method using the
    FIFO method to better reflect the current value of inventory in
    the balance sheet and to provide a better matching of revenue
    and expense in the consolidated statements of income. In
    addition, this change results in a more unified


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

method of inventory costing. The result of the accounting change
    was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements for all
    periods presented. Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the
    accounting change was recorded in the consolidated statement of
    income in the fourth quarter of 2006, rather than
    retrospectively applied to the prior period consolidated
    financial statements.

Property,
    plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at historical cost. We
    compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the
    following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold
    improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or
    extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for
    repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When
    property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
    and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment
    loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
    value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets
    held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that
    fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets.
    The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future
    cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Goodwill
    and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. During the
    fourth quarter of 2006, we completed our annual impairment test
    of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, brand names, patents, non-compete agreements,
    proprietary technology, and customer relationships. Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,

identifiable intangibles with finite
    lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with
    indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible
    assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable
    intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for
    impairment annually, or more frequently if events warrant. The
    impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of
    the intangible asset with its carrying amount. During the fourth
    quarter of 2006, we completed our annual impairment test for
    those identifiable assets not subject to amortization and
    determined there was no impairment.

Cost
    and equity method investments

We have investments that are accounted for at historical cost
    or, if we have significant influence over the investee, using
    the equity method. Our proportionate share of income or losses
    from investments accounted for under the equity method is
    recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We write down
    or write off an


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances
    indicate there is impairment in the investment that is

other-than-temporary.

This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the
    investees’ financial condition, and in certain cases the
    possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the
    investees’ historical and projected results of operations
    and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are
    significantly different from projections, we may incur future
    charges for the impairment of these investments.

Income
    taxes

We use the asset and liability approach to account for income
    taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
    the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are
    reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
    management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in
    valuation allowances from period to period are included in our
    tax provision in the period of change.

Environmental

In accordance with

SOP 96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

, we recognize
    environmental

clean-up

liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not
    subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental

clean-up

is
    estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based
    on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the
    estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the
    likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible
    parties (“PRPs”) will be able to fulfill their
    commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and
    severally liable. The process of estimating environmental

clean-up

liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and
    extent of historical information and physical data relating to a
    contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty
    as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the
    outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs
    at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or
    regulations, advances in

clean-up

technologies, and additional information about the ultimate

clean-up

remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.
    Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in O

ther
    current liabilities

and

Other non-current liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance
    subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, reserves
    for policy claims were $54.3 million ($10.0 million
    included in A

ccrued product claims and warranties

and
    $44.3 million included in O

ther non-current
    liabilities

) and $45.8 million ($10.0 million
    included in A

ccrued product claims and warranties

and
    $35.8 million included in O

ther non-current
    liabilities

), respectively.

Stock-based
    compensation

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123R (revised
    2004),

Share Based Payment,

(“SFAS 123R”)
    which revised SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(“SFAS 123”) and
    supersedes Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees
    (“APB 25”)

requiring us to recognize expense
    related to the fair value of our stock-based compensation
    awards. We adopted SFAS 123R effective January 1, 2005
    using the modified retrospective transition method permitted by
    SFAS 123R. Under this transition method, restatement of
    only the

    (continued)

interim financial statements in the year of adoption is
    permitted. We did not restate the financial information for 2004
    as a result of the adoption. In connection with the adoption,
    the expense in the pro forma disclosures related to stock-based
    compensation was corrected for immaterial errors, resulting in
    no change to previously reported quarterly pro forma earnings
    per share. The adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in
    the recognition of incremental pre-tax stock-based compensation
    expense of $16.4 million, a reduction in net income of
    $12.0 million, a reduction in basic and diluted earnings
    per share of $0.12, a reduction in cash flows from operating
    activities of $8.7 million and an increase in cash flows
    from financing activities of $8.7 million. We additionally
    reclassified our unearned compensation on non-vested share
    awards of $7.9 million to additional paid in capital. The
    cumulative effect adjustment for forfeitures related to
    non-vested share awards was immaterial.

In accordance with SFAS 123R, the estimated grant date fair
    value of each stock-based award is recognized in income on an
    accelerated basis over the requisite service period (generally
    the vesting period). The estimated fair value of each option is
    calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. From
    time to time, we have elected to modify the terms of the
    original grant. These modified grants are accounted for as a new
    award and measured using the fair value method under
    SFAS 123R, resulting in the inclusion of additional
    compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
    Non-vested share awards are recorded as compensation cost over
    the requisite service periods based on the market value on the
    date of grant.

Prior to January 1, 2005 we applied the recognition and
    measurement principles of APB 25 to our stock options and
    other stock-based compensation plans as permitted pursuant to
    SFAS 123.

In accordance with APB 25, cost for stock-based
    compensation was recognized in income based on the excess, if
    any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date
    of the award or other measurement date over the amount an
    employee must pay to acquire the stock. The exercise price for
    stock options granted to employees equals the fair market value
    of our common stock at the date of grant, thereby resulting in
    no recognition of compensation expense by us. However, from time
    to time, we have elected to modify the terms of the original
    grant. Those modified grants have been accounted for as a new
    award and measured using the intrinsic value method under
    APB 25, resulting in the inclusion of compensation expense
    in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Non-vested share
    awards are recorded as compensation cost over the requisite
    service periods based on the market value on the date of grant.
    Unearned compensation cost on non-vested share awards was shown
    as a reduction to shareholders’ equity.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
    by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
    including the dilutive effects of stock options and non-vested
    shares. Unless otherwise noted, references are to diluted
    earnings per share.

Derivative
    financial instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other
    contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative is designated as
    a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If
    the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow
    hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded
    in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income when the hedged item affects
    earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist
    or if the hedge becomes ineffective, all changes in fair value
    of the related derivatives that have not been settled are
    recognized in current earnings. For a derivative that is not
    designated as or does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair
    value are reported in earnings immediately.

We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
    interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of
    ongoing business operations. All hedging instruments are
    designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 133,

Accounting for Derivative
    Instruments and Hedge Activities,

as amended. We do not hold
    or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or
    speculative purposes. All other contracts that contain
    provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also meet the
    requirements of, and have been designated as, normal purchases
    or sales. Our policy is not to enter into contracts with terms
    that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales.

Foreign
    currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the
    United States are measured using the local currency as the
    functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the
    balance sheet date.

The resultant translation adjustments are included in
    accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are
    translated at average monthly rates of exchange.

New
    accounting standards

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges
    of Nonmonetary Assets — An Amendment of APB Opinion
    No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

(“SFAS 153”). SFAS 153 eliminates the
    exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges
    of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB
    Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
    Transactions

, and replaces it with an exception for
    exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153
    specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance
    if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
    significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is
    effective for the fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
    2005 and we adopted it on January 1, 2006. The adoption of
    SFAS 153 did not have a material impact on our consolidated
    results of operations, financial condition, or cash flow.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs — An Amendment of ARB No. 43,
    Chapter 4

(“SFAS 151”). SFAS 151
    amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4,
    “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for
    abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling
    costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Among other provisions,
    the new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense,
    excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be
    recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they
    meet the criterion of “so abnormal” as stated in ARB
    No. 43. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that the
    allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
    conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
    facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after June 15, 2005 and we adopted it on
    January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 151 did not have
    a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or
    financial condition.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”)
    reached a consensus on Issue

No. 03-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

(“EITF

03-1”).

EITF

03-1

provides guidance on

other-than-temporary

impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities
    accounted for under SFAS 115 and non-marketable equity
    securities accounted for under the cost method. The EITF
    developed a basic three-step model to evaluate whether an
    investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired. In November 2005, the FASB approved the issuance of
    FASB Staff Position

FAS No. 115-1

and

FAS No. 124-1,

The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain
    Investments.

The FASB Staff Position
    (“FSP”) addresses when an investment is considered
    impaired, whether the impairment is

other-than-temporary,

and the measurement of an impairment loss. The FSP also includes
    accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an

other-than-temporary

impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
    losses that have not been recognized as

other-than-temporary.

The FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after
    December 15, 2005 and we adopted it on January 1,
    2006. The adoption of EITF

03-1

did not
    have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations
    or financial condition.

In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154,

Accounting Changes and Error Corrections

(“SFAS 154”) which replaces Accounting
    Principles Board Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

and SFAS No. 3,

Reporting Accounting Changes in
    Interim Financial Statements — An Amendment of APB
    Opinion No. 28.

SFAS 154 provides
    guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting
    changes and error corrections. It establishes retrospective
    application, or the latest practicable date, as the required
    method for reporting a


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

change in accounting principle and the reporting of a correction
    of an error. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes
    and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after
    December 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 154 on
    January 1, 2006 did not have a material impact on our
    consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

In June 2005, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue

No. 05-5,

Accounting for Early Retirement or Postemployment Programs
    with Specific Features (such as Terms Specified in
    Altersteilzeit Early Retirement Arrangements)

(“EITF

05-5”).

EITF

05-5

addresses the accounting for the bonus feature in the German
    Altersteilzeit (“ATZ”) early retirement programs and
    requires recognition of the program expenses at the time the ATZ
    contracts are signed. The EITF offers two transition
    alternatives, either cumulative effect or retrospective
    application. EITF

05-5

is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
    2005 and we adopted it on January 1, 2006. The adoption of
    EITF

05-5

did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of
    operations or financial condition.

In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes

—

an interpretation of FASB Statement 109

(“FIN 48”). FIN 48 prescribes a
    comprehensive model for recognizing, measuring, presenting and
    disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or
    expected to be taken on a tax return, including a decision
    whether to file or not to file a tax return in a particular
    jurisdiction. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after December 15, 2006. If there are changes in
    net assets as a result of the application of FIN 48, these
    will be accounted for as an adjustment to retained earnings. We
    are currently assessing the impact of FIN 48 on our
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In September 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued
    Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108,

Considering the
    Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying
    Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements

(“SAB 108”). SAB 108 addresses diversity
    in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements.
    SAB 108 requires that a company quantify misstatements
    based on their impact on each of its financial statements and
    related disclosures. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years
    ending after November 15, 2006, allowing a one-time
    transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings
    as of January 1, 2006 for errors that were not previously
    deemed material, but are material under the guidance in
    SAB 108. The adoption of SAB 108 did not have a
    material impact on our consolidated results of operations,
    financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements, but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting
    SFAS 157 on our consolidated results of operations or
    financial condition.

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that we
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined
    benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in
    our 2006 year-end balance sheet, with changes in the funded
    status recognized through other comprehensive income in the year
    in which they occur. The adoption of SFAS 158 increased
    total assets by $2.0 million, increased total liabilities
    by $14.9 million and decreased total shareholders’
    equity by $12.9 million, net of tax, in our
    December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet. The adoption
    of SFAS 158 had no impact on our consolidated results of
    operations.

2.

Acquisitions

On December 11, 2006 we entered into an agreement to
    acquire all of the share capital of Jung Pumpen GmbH, a
    German-based manufacturer of municipal and residential
    wastewater pumps and related products, subject to German Federal
    Cartel Office approval. The acquisition was completed on
    February 2, 2007 for


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

approximately $227 million, net of cash acquired of
    $13 million, excluding transaction costs and subject to a
    post-closing net asset value adjustment.

On April 12, 2006, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    the assets of Geyer’s Manufacturing & Design Inc.
    and FTA Filtration, Inc. (together “Krystil Klear”),
    two privately-held companies, for $15.5 million in cash.
    Krystil Klear expands our industrial filtration product offering
    to include a full range of steel and stainless steel tanks which
    house filtration solutions. Goodwill recorded as part of the
    initial purchase price allocation was $9.2 million, all of
    which is tax deductible. We continue to evaluate the purchase
    price allocation for the Krystil Klear acquisition, including
    intangible assets, contingent liabilities, plant rationalization
    costs, and property, plant and equipment. We expect to revise
    the purchase price allocation as better information becomes
    available.

During 2006, we completed several other small acquisitions
    totaling $14.2 million in cash and notes payable, adding to
    both our Water and Technical Products Groups. Total goodwill
    recorded as part of the initial purchase price allocations was
    $7.9 million, of which $2.9 million is tax deductible.
    We continue to evaluate the purchase price allocations for these
    acquisitions and expect to revise the purchase price allocations
    as better information becomes available.

On December 1, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Technical
    Products Group, the McLean Thermal Management, Aspen Motion
    Technologies, and Electronic Solutions businesses from APW, Ltd.
    (collectively, “Thermal”) for $143.9 million,
    including a cash payment of $140.6 million and transaction
    costs of $3.3 million. These businesses provide thermal
    management solutions and integration services to the
    telecommunications, data communications, medical, and security
    markets. Final goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price
    allocation was $71.1 million, all of which is tax
    deductible. Final identifiable intangible assets acquired as
    part of the acquisition were $45.6 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as proprietary technology and
    customer relationships, of $23.1 million with a weighted
    average amortization period of approximately 12 years.

On February 23, 2005, we acquired, as part of our Water
    Group, certain assets of Delta Environmental Products, Inc. and
    affiliates (collectively, “DEP”), a privately-held
    company, for $10.3 million, including a cash payment of
    $10.0 million, transaction costs of $0.2 million, and
    debt assumed of $0.1 million. The DEP product line
    addressees the water and wastewater markets. Final goodwill
    recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was
    $7.2 million, all of which is tax deductible.

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of
    all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR, Inc.
    (“WICOR”) from Wisconsin Energy Corporation
    (“WEC”) for $874.7 million, including a cash
    payment of $871.1 million, transaction costs of
    $11.2 million, and debt assumed of $21.6 million, less
    a favorable final purchase price adjustment of
    $14.0 million and less cash acquired of $15.2 million.
    This includes an additional $0.4 million in transaction
    costs recorded in the first three quarters of 2005. WICOR
    manufactured water system, filtration, and pool equipment
    products primarily under the
    STA-RITE

    would have resulted had the combination occurred on January 1 of
    each year presented, or of future results of the consolidated
    entities.

3.  Discontinued
    Operations/Divestitures

Effective after the close of business on October 2, 2004,
    we completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”). In
    January 2006, pursuant to the purchase agreement for the sale of
    our former Tools Group, we completed the repurchase of a
    manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China from BDK for
    approximately $5.7 million. We recorded no gain or loss on
    the repurchase. In March 2006, we completed an outstanding net
    asset value arbitration with BDK relating to the purchase price
    for the sale of our former Tools Group. The decision by the
    arbitrator constituted a final resolution of all disputes
    between BDK and us regarding the net asset value. We paid the
    final net asset value purchase price adjustment pursuant to the
    purchase agreement of $16.1 million plus interest of
    $1.1 million in March 2006, resulting in an incremental
    pre-tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations of
    $3.4 million or $1.6 million net of tax. In the third
    quarter of 2006, we resolved a prior year tax item that resulted
    in a $1.4 million income tax benefit related to our former
    Tools Group.

In 2001, we completed the sale of our former Service Equipment
    businesses (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) to
    Clore Automotive, LLC. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we
    reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of
    $2.9 million related to exiting the remaining two
    facilities. In March 2006, we exited a leased facility from our
    former Service Equipment business resulting in a net cash
    outflow of $2.2 million and an immaterial gain from
    disposition.

Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarized
    below. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead previously
    allocated to the Tools Group. The amounts include an allocation
    of interest based on a ratio of the net assets of the
    discontinued operations to the total net assets of Pentair.

We recorded additional pre-tax losses on the disposal of
    discontinued operations of $3.6 million and
    $4.2 million as of December 31, 2006 and 2005
    respectively. The 2006 loss was primarily due to an unfavorable
    arbitration ruling resulting in a purchase price adjustment
    associated with the sale of our former Tools Group. The
    additional 2005 loss relates to increased reserve requirements
    for product recalls and contingent purchase price adjustments
    associated with the sale of our former Tools Group. Income tax
    benefits of $3.6 million and $4.2 million were
    recorded for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. The effective tax rate for discontinued operations
    in 2006 differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the
    reversal of prior years’ tax reserves and research and
    development tax credits. The effective tax rate in 2005 for
    discontinued operations differs from the statutory rate due
    primarily to research and development tax credits and permanent
    book/tax differences.

As part of the sale of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we received
    37,500 shares of 5% Series C Junior Convertible
    Redeemable Preferred Stock convertible into a 15% equity
    interest in the new organization — LN Holdings
    Corporation. During the second quarter of 2005 we sold our
    interest in the stock LN Holdings Corporation for cash
    consideration of $23.6 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain
    of $5.2 million or an after-tax gain of $3.5 million.
    The terms of the sale agreement established two escrow accounts
    totaling $14 million. We received payments from an escrow
    of $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2005,
    increasing our gain. During 2006 we received $1.2 million
    from the escrow accounts which also increased our gain from the
    sale. Any remaining escrow balances are to be distributed by
    April 2008 to former shareholders in accordance with their
    ownership percentages. Any funds received from settlement of
    escrows in future periods will be accounted for as additional
    gain on sale of this interest.

We have a 50% investment in FARADYNE Motors LLC

    manufacturing of submersible pump motors in 2005. We do not
    consolidate the investment in our financial statements as we do
    not have a controlling interest over the investment. The
    investment in and loans to FARADYNE balance was
    $5.4 million and $1.2 million at December 31,
    2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively, which is net of

In 2006, the minimum pension liability adjustment increased
    compared to 2005 primarily due to the adoption of SFAS 158,
    as noted in Note 11. In 2005, the minimum pension liability
    adjustment increased compared to the prior year despite no
    change in the discount rate for the U.S. plans. The
    increase was attributable to lower than expected pension plan
    performance as well as a reduction in the discount rates
    associated with our foreign defined benefit plans. The net
    foreign currency translation gain in 2006 of $28.5 million
    was the result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against
    the euro. The net foreign currency translation loss in 2005 of
    $28.4 million was the result of the strengthening of the
    U.S. dollar against the euro. Changes in the market value
    of derivative financial instruments were impacted primarily by
    the maturities of derivatives and changing interest rates.
    Fluctuations in the value of hedging instruments are generally
    offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying exposures
    being hedged.

    Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest rates and fees on
    the Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to

    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of
    December 31, 2006, we had $208.9 million of commercial
    paper outstanding that matures within 49 days.

9.  Derivative
    and Financial Instruments

Cash-flow
    hedges

In September 2005, we entered into a $100 million interest
    rate swap agreement with several major financial institutions to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for fixed
    rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying
    principle amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures.
    The effective date of the fixed rate swap was April 25,
    2006. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.68% and
    expires in July 2013. The fixed interest rate of 4.68% plus the
    .60% interest rate spread over LIBOR, results in an effective
    fixed interest rate of 5.28%. The fair value of the swap was an
    asset of $1.9 million and $0.8 million at
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively and is recorded in

Other assets.

The variable to fixed interest rate swap is designated as and is
    effective as a cash-flow hedge. The fair value of this swap is
    recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, with changes in fair
    value included in other comprehensive income (OCI). Derivative
    gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings
    at the time the related interest expense is recognized or the
    settlement of the related commitment occurs. No hedging
    relationships were de-designated during 2006.

    each class of financial instrument:

•

short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents,
    accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable, and
    short-term borrowings) — recorded amount approximates
    fair value because of the short maturity period;

•

long-term debt, including current maturities — fair
    value is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt
    with similar terms; and

•

interest rate swap agreements — fair value is based on
    market or dealer quotes.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of
    these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets”
    (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
    in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities”
    (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the
    tax impact has not yet been recorded in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income).

During 2006, our effective tax rate was impacted by favorable
    resolution of prior years’ federal tax returns and higher
    utilization of foreign tax credits.

During 2005, our effective tax rate was impacted by R&D tax
    credits, and favorable resolution of prior years’ federal
    tax returns. Our effective tax rate was also impacted favorably
    by tax deductions for profits associated with qualified domestic
    production activities. These favorable items were offset by an
    unfavorable settlement for a routine German tax examination
    related to prior years as well as the tax impact of the adoption
    of SFAS 123R.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we repatriated approximately
    $75.0 million in extraordinary dividends, as defined in the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”),
    consisting primarily of foreign proceeds resulting from the sale
    of the Tools Group. We elected to apply the provisions of
    Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted as part
    of the Jobs Act, to the repatriated extraordinary dividends and
    therefore, were eligible to claim an eighty-five percent
    dividends received deduction for income tax purposes on the
    eligible amounts. The net tax cost of the repatriation of the
    extraordinary dividends, recorded in discontinued operations,
    was approximately $4.0 million.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our
    intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to
    repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.
    As of December 31, 2006, approximately $120 million of
    unremitted earnings attributable to international subsidiaries
    were considered to be indefinitely invested. We believe that any
    U.S. tax on repatriated earnings would be substantially
    offset by U.S. foreign tax credits.

The determination of annual income tax expense takes into
    consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for
    open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examined
    our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2003 with no
    material adjustments. The IRS has also completed a survey of our
    2004 U.S. federal income tax return with no material
    findings. In connection with the completion of the 2002 to 2003
    federal income tax audit and the 2004 survey, we recognized
    benefits of $8.0 million and $1.8 million in our
    second and third quarter 2006 income statements, respectively.
    We do not expect any material impact on earnings to result from
    the resolution of matters related to open tax years; however,
    actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.

Non-U.S. tax

losses of $9.1 million and $5.7 million were available
    for carryforward at December 31, 2006 and 2005,
    respectively. A valuation allowance of $1.6 million and
    $1.5 million exists for deferred income tax benefits
    related to the

non-U.S. loss

carryforwards available that may not be realized as of
    December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We believe that
    sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective
    countries to allow us to fully recover the remainder of the tax
    losses. A majority of our

non-U.S. tax

losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining

non-U.S. tax

losses will begin to expire in 2009. State tax losses of
    $56.1 million and $43.5 million were available for
    carryforward at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively.
    Valuation allowances exist for the entire balance of deferred
    tax benefits related to the state tax losses. Certain state tax
    losses will expire in 2007, while others are subject to
    carryforward periods of up to twenty years.

11.

Benefit
    Plans

Pension
    and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based
    principally on an employee’s years of service

and/or

compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also
    provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance
    benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life
    insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a
    December 31 measurement date each year.

On December 31, 2006, we adopted SFAS 158 which
    requires that we recognize the overfunded or underfunded status
    of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or
    liability in our 2006 year-end Consolidated Balance Sheets, with
    changes in the funded status recognized through other
    comprehensive income, net of tax.

In 2004, under the requirements of SFAS No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
    Benefits

, we recognized a curtailment expense and special
    termination benefits totaling approximately $1.8 million
    due to the divestiture of the Tools Group.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount
    rate was determined by matching our


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of AA or
    higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate
    the effects of call provisions. This produced a discount rate
    for our U.S. plans of 6.00% in 2006 and 5.75% in 2005 and
    2004. The discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 2.00%
    to 5.15% in 2006, 2.00% to 4.90% in 2005 and 2.00% to 5.25% in
    2004. There are no other known or anticipated changes in our
    discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in
    2007.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2006 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2005 and 2004. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices. In 2006, the pension plan assets
    yielded a return of 12.3%, compared to returns of 4.2% in 2005
    and 17.6% in 2004. In 2006, our expected return on plan assets
    was lower than our actual return on plan assets while in 2005
    our expected return on plan assets was higher than our actual
    return on plans assets. The significant difference between our
    expected return on plan assets compared to our actual return on
    plan assets in 2006 was primarily attributable to overall market
    performance being better than expected. The significant
    difference between our expected return on plan assets compared
    to our actual return on plan assets in 2005 was primarily
    attributable to the fluctuations of our common stock during 2005
    which approximates 10% of the plan assets. There are no known or
    anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact
    our pension expense in 2007.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension
    and post-retirement related adjustments to equity

In 2004, our discount rate was lowered from 6.25% to 5.75%.
    However, the change in the discount rate assumption was offset
    by higher than anticipated returns on assets and thus, did not
    significantly affect our shareholders’ equity. In 2005, our
    discount rate remained consistent with 2004; however, a lower
    return on plan assets as well as a decrease in the discount
    rates for our foreign plans resulted in an after-tax charge to
    equity of $5.7 million. In 2006, our discount rate
    increased from 5.75% to 6.00% and our return on plan assets was
    higher than anticipated. Before the effect of adopting
    SFAS 158, we had an after-tax increase in equity of
    $1.5 million. The effect of initially applying
    SFAS 158 resulted in an after-tax charge to equity of
    $12.9 million.

Net
    periodic benefit cost

Total net periodic pension benefit cost was $24.5 million
    in 2006, $20.0 million in 2005, and $19.2 million in
    2004. Total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected to be
    approximately $25 million in 2007. The net periodic pension
    benefit cost for 2007 has been estimated assuming a discount
    rate of 6.0% and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5%.

Unrecognized
    pension and post-retirement losses

As of our December 31, 2006 measurement date, our plans
    have $47.0 million of cumulative unrecognized losses. To
    the extent the unrecognized loss, when adjusted for the
    difference between market and market related values of assets,
    exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, it will be
    amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over
    the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active
    participants


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to

(currently approximating 12 years). The amount included in
    net periodic benefit cost for loss amortization was
    $3.3 million and $2.8 million in 2006 and 2005,
    respectively.

Objective

The primary objective of our pension plans is to meet
    commitments to our employees at a reasonable cost to the
    company. This is primarily accomplished through growth of
    capital and safety of the funds invested. The plans will
    therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital
    over inflation through appreciation of securities held and
    through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and
    interest income.

    benefit pension plans in fiscal year 2006. In 2005, pension
    contributions totaled $4.1 million, including
    $0.3 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit
    pension plans. Our 2007 pension contributions are expected to be
    in the range of $15 million to $20 million. The 2007
    expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding

Savings
    plan

We have a 401(k) plan (the plan) with an employee stock
    ownership (ESOP) bonus component, which covers certain union and
    nearly all non-union U.S. employees who meet certain age
    requirements. Under the plan, eligible U.S. employees may
    voluntarily contribute a percentage of their eligible
    compensation. Matching contributions are made in cash to
    employees who meet certain eligibility and service requirements.
    Our matching contribution is fixed at 50% of eligible employee
    contributions, and is limited to 5% of employee compensation
    contributed by employees.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet
    certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP
    contribution equal to 1.5% of annual eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the plan and ESOP was approximately
    $12.3 million, $8.8 million, and $10.7 million,
    in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively.

12.  Shareholders’
    Equity

Authorized shares

We may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our
    Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those
    shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board
    of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock of up to
    2.5 million shares, Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share. No shares of
    preferred stock were issued or outstanding as of
    December 31, 2006 or December 31, 2005.

Purchase
    rights

On December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock.
    The dividend was payable upon the close of business on
    January 28, 2005 to the shareholders of record upon the
    close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right entitles
    the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share
    of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a
    price of $240.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless
    certain change in control events occur, such as a person
    acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership
    of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. The


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights
    Agreement, dated December 10, 2004. The Rights will expire
    on January 28, 2015, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed
    or exchanged in accordance with the terms of the Rights
    Agreement. On January 28, 2005, the common share purchase
    rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated
    July 31, 1995 were redeemed in their entirety for an amount
    equal to $0.0025 per right.

Share
    repurchases

In December 2005, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar
    limit of $25 million of our common stock. On July 28,
    2006, the Board of Directors increased our repurchase
    authorization to $50 million, and on September 28,
    2006, the Board of Directors further increased our repurchase
    authorization to $100 million. As of December 31,
    2006, we had purchased 1,986,026 shares for
    $59.4 million pursuant to these programs during 2006. The
    Board of Directors authorized the continuation of the repurchase
    program in 2007 with a maximum dollar limit of
    $40.6 million. This authorization expires on
    December 31, 2007. As of February 16, 2007, we had not
    repurchased any additional shares under this plan and,
    accordingly, we have the authority in 2007 to repurchase shares
    up to a maximum dollar limit of $40.6 million. In 2005 and
    2004, respectively, we repurchased 755,663 shares and
    105,500 shares of our common stock under similar
    authorizations.

13.  Stock
    Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense from continuing
    operations in 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $25.3 million,
    $24.2 million, and $6.3 million, respectively. The
    increase in 2005 is attributable to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R in the fourth quarter of 2005 using the modified
    retrospective transition method and restating interim periods in
    2005. The adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in the
    recognition of incremental pre-tax stock-based compensation of
    $16.4 million, a reduction in net income of
    $12.0 million, a reduction in basic and diluted earnings
    per share of $0.12, a reduction in cash flows from operating
    activities of $8.7 million and an increase in cash flows
    from financing activities of $8.7 million. We additionally
    reclassified our unearned compensation on non-vested share
    awards of $7.9 million to additional paid in capital. The
    cumulative effect adjustment for forfeitures related to
    non-vested share awards was immaterial.

Prior to 2005, we applied APB 25 and the disclosure-only
    provisions of SFAS No. 123. The following table
    illustrates the effect on income and earnings per share if we
    had applied the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation
    during 2004. The estimated fair value of each Pentair option was
    calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Omnibus
    stock incentive plan

In April 2004, the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended and
    Restated (the “Plan”) was approved by shareholders.
    The Plan authorizes the issuance of additional shares of our
    common stock and extends through April 2014. The Plan allows for
    the granting of:

•

nonqualified stock options;

•

incentive stock options;

•

non-vested shares;

•

rights to non-vested shares;


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

•

incentive compensation units (ICUs);

•

stock appreciation rights;

•

performance shares; and

•

performance units.

The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee (the
    “Committee”), which is made up of independent members
    of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards
    under the Plan are managerial, administrative, or other key
    employees who are in a position to make a material contribution
    to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of
    Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the
    recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards,
    establish certain terms and conditions of award grants, and take
    certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan
    provides that no more than 20% of the total shares available for
    issuance under the Plan may be used to make awards other than
    stock options and limits the Committee’s authority to
    reprice awards or to cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

Non-qualified
    and incentive stock options

Under the Plan, we may grant stock options to any eligible
    employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally
    vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and
    expire ten years after the grant date. Prior to 2006, option
    grants typically had a reload feature when shares are retired to
    pay the exercise price, allowing individuals to receive
    additional options upon exercise equal to the number of shares
    retired. Option awards granted after 2005 under the Plan do not
    have a reload feature attached to the option.

Non-vested
    shares and rights to non-vested shares

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded non-vested shares
    or rights to non-vested shares (awards) of our common stock.
    Share awards generally vest from two to five years after
    issuance, subject to continuous employment and certain other
    conditions. Non-vested share awards are valued at market value
    on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period.
    Annual expense for the value of non-vested shares and rights to
    non-vested shares was $11.1 million in 2006,
    $7.0 million in 2005, and $6.3 million in 2004.

Stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares, and performance
    units

Under the Plan, the compensation committee is permitted to issue
    these awards; however, there have been no issuances of these
    awards.

Outside
    directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options are granted to outside directors
    under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the
    “Directors Plan”) with an exercise price equal to the
    market value of the shares on the option grant dates. Options
    generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant
    date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors
    Plan extends to January 2008.

Business
    Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following
    business segments:

•

Water

— manufactures and markets
    essential products and systems used in the movement, storage,
    treatment, and enjoyment of water. Water segment products
    include water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification
    components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and
    pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Technical Products

—  designs,
    manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom
    enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and
    electrical components; thermal management products; and
    accessories. Applications served include industrial machinery,
    data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and
    measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general
    electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures,
    cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal
    management systems.

•

Other

— is primarily composed of
    unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance
    subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations,
    and intercompany eliminations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and
    operating income of the segments and use a variety of ratios to
    measure performance. These results are not necessarily
    indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred
    had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during
    the periods presented.

Financial information by reportable business segment is

Net sales are based on the location in which the sale
    originated. Long-lived assets represent property, plant, and
    equipment, net of related depreciation.

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple
    markets and customers for which we do not have the information
    systems to track revenues by primary product category. However,
    our net sales by segment is representative of our sales by major
    product category.

We sell our products through various distribution channels
    including wholesale and retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. In our Water segment, one
    customer accounted for just over 10% of segment sales in 2006,
    no single customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales
    in 2005, and in 2004 one customer accounted for about 11% of
    segment sales. In our Technical Products segment, no single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in 2006,
    2005, or 2004.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a small number of
    environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have
    established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
    potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.
    We settled some of the claims in prior years; to date our
    recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2006
    and 2005, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $5.6 million and
    $6.4 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims could change in the future.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald Insurance
    Company (“Penwald”) our captive insurance subsidiary.
    Penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial
    projections of ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals
    covering the claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing
    information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as
    additional information becomes available. We have not
    experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the
    severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal
    injury claims.

Horizon
    litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs,
    a class action, and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise
    Lines, Inc. (“Celebrity”) were brought against Essef
    Corporation (“Essef”) and certain of its subsidiaries
    prior to our acquisition of Essef in August 1999. The claims
    against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the
    allegation that Essef designed, manufactured, and marketed two
    sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the
    spa system on the Horizon cruise ship, and allegations that the
    spa and filters contained Legionnaire’s disease bacteria
    that infected certain passengers on cruises from April 1994
    through July 1994.

The individual and class claims by passengers were tried and
    resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the
    part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister
    company, Fantasia (together 30%). After expiration of post-trial
    appeals, we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of
    $7.0 million in the Horizon cases, plus interest of
    approximately $1.6 million, in January 2004. All of the
    personal injury cases have now been resolved through either
    settlement or judgment.

The only remaining unresolved claims in this case were those
    brought by Celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak.
    Celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and
    costs for prior litigation as well as

out-of-pocket

losses, lost profits, and loss of business enterprise value. On
    June 28, 2006, a jury returned a verdict against the Essef
    defendants in the total amount of $193.0 million for its
    claims for

out-of-pocket

expenses ($10.4 million), lost profits ($47.6 million)
    and lost enterprise value ($135.0 million). The verdict was
    exclusive of pre-judgment interest and attorneys’ fees.

On January 17, 2007, the Court ruled on our post-trial
    motions, granting judgment in our favor as a matter of law with
    respect to Celebrity’s claim for lost enterprise value
    ($135.0 million). The Court also granted a new trial with
    respect to lost profits ($47.6 million). In addition, the
    Court denied without prejudice our claim for contribution to
    reduce Celebrity’s recovery by 30% to account for its
    contributory negligence, with leave to renew the motion
    following retrial.

Celebrity’s claim for lost profits at trial amounted to
    approximately $60.3 million. We believe that actual lost
    profits suffered, if any, are substantially less. In a new
    trial, there remain questions of causation, contribution and
    proof of damages to be determined. We intend to vigorously
    defend against Celebrity’s claims. We cannot predict
    whether Celebrity will appeal the ruling on lost enterprise
    value, nor whether and to what extent Essef may eventually be
    found liable on Celebrity’s claims.

Several issues have not been decided by the Court, including
    whether Celebrity is entitled to recovery of its attorneys’
    fees and related costs in the passenger claims phase of the case
    ($4.1 million), and, with respect to pre-judgment interest,
    the length of the interest period and the rate of interest on
    any eventual judgment. We have assessed the impact of the ruling
    on our previously established reserves for this matter and,
    based on information available at this time, have not changed
    our reserves following this ruling, except to take into account
    quarterly interest accruals.

We believe that any judgment we pay in this matter would be
    tax-deductible in the year paid or in subsequent years. In
    addition to the impact of any loss on this matter on our
    earnings per share when recognized, we may need to borrow funds
    from our banks or other sources to pay any judgment finally
    determined after exhaustion of all appeals. We expect that we
    would have available adequate funds to allow us to do so, based
    on discussions with our lending sources and our estimates of the
    results of our business operations over the foreseeable future.

Warranties
    and guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product
    lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various
    potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as
    pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or
    other obligations. The subject matter, amounts, and duration of
    any such indemnification


Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

obligations vary for each type of liability indemnified and may
    vary widely from transaction to transaction. Generally, the
    maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly
    stated and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations
    cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made
    significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that
    if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss
    would not have a material effect on our financial condition or
    results of operations.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45
    (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Others

, we recognize, at the inception of a
    guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
    undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products.
    Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a
    review of historical warranty and service claim experience.
    Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical
    experience warrant.

The changes in the carrying amount of service and product
    warranties for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005

Stand-by
    letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly for contracts
    and bids involving municipal pump products, we are required to
    commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit to secure our performance to third parties under
    self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, the
    outstanding value of these instruments totaled
    $59.6 million and $38.8 million, respectively.

Individual Stock Option Agreement.

On
    January 2, 2001, the Company awarded Randall J. Hogan
    (currently the Company’s Chairman and Chief Executive
    Officer) an option to purchase 48,000 shares of common
    stock pursuant to an individual stock option agreement. These
    options have an exercise price of $11.375 per share and
    vested in three equal annual installments, commencing one year
    after the date of grant. The options expire 10 years after
    the date of grant and the exercise price of the options was the
    closing price of common stock on the date of grant. If a
    “Change in Control” (as defined in the Company’s
    Key Executive Employment and Severance Agreements) of the
    Company occurs, then all the options not yet exercised become
    immediately exercisable. All share numbers and per share amounts
    described in this section have been changed to reflect the
    Company’s

2-for-1

stock split in 2004.

Burn Rate.

Our three-year average burn rate is
    approximately 2.60% when calculated using the guidelines
    published by Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS). Under ISS
    guidelines, the “burn-rate” is the total number of
    equity awards granted in any given year divided by the number of
    common shares outstanding, with a premium applied to grants of
    restricted stock. The number of equity awards used in the burn
    rate calculation is not discounted by cancelled or forfeited
    options or shares acquired or retained by the Company.
