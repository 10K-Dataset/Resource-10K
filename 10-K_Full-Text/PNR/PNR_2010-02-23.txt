Customers

Our Water Group distributes its products through wholesale
    distributors, retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, home centers and home and pool builders.
    Information regarding significant customers in our Water Group
    is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sale “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Competition

Our Water Group faces numerous domestic and international
    competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources
    directed to the markets in which we compete. Consolidation,
    globalization, and outsourcing are continuing trends in the
    water industry. Competition in commercial and residential flow
    technologies markets focuses on trade names, product
    performance, quality, and price. While home center and national
    retailers are important for residential lines of water and
    wastewater pumps, they are not important for commercial pumps.
    For municipal pumps, competition focuses on performance to meet
    required specifications, service, and price. Competition in
    water treatment and filtration components focuses on product
    performance and design, quality, delivery, and price. For pool
    equipment, competition focuses on trade names, product
    performance, quality, and price. We compete by offering a wide
    variety of innovative and high-quality products, which are
    competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels and
    reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market
    penetration.

TECHNICAL
    PRODUCTS GROUP

Our Technical Products Group is a leader in the global
    enclosures and thermal management markets, designing and
    manufacturing standard, modified, and custom enclosures that
    house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical
    components and protect the people that use them. We have
    identified a target market of $11 billion. Our Technical
    Products Group focuses its business portfolio on eight primary
    vertical markets: Industrial (35% of group sales),
    Communications (25% of group sales), General Electronics (10% of
    group sales), Energy (10% of group sales), and Commercial,
    Security and Defense, Infrastructure and Medical (these four
    vertical combined represent approximately 20% of group sales).
    The primary trade names for the Technical Products Group are:
    Hoffman

    Schroff

    Products include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets,
    cases, subracks, backplanes and associated thermal management
    systems. Applications served include industrial machinery, data
    communications, networking, telecommunications, test and
    measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general
    electronics.

Customers

Our Technical Products Group distributes its products through
    electrical and data contractors, electrical and electronic
    components distributors, and original equipment manufacturers.
    Information regarding significant customers in our Technical
    Products Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our Technical Products Group is not significantly affected by
    seasonal demand fluctuations.



Competition

Competition in the technical products markets can be intense,
    particularly in the Communications market, where product design,
    prototyping, global supply, price competition, and customer
    service are significant factors. Our Technical Products Group
    has continued to focus on cost control and improving
    profitability. Recent sales decreases in the Technical Products
    Group are the result of market declines due to the global
    recession. The impact of these market declines has been
    partially offset by growth initiatives focused on product
    development, continued channel penetration, growth in targeted
    market segments, geographic expansion, and price increases.
    Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are visible trends
    in the technical products marketplace and typically play to the
    strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier. We
    believe our Technical Products Group has the global
    manufacturing capability and broad product portfolio to support
    the globalization and outsourcing trends.

RECENT
    DEVELOPMENTS

Growth
    of our business

We continually look at each of our businesses to determine
    whether they fit with our strategic vision. Our primary focus is
    on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities,
    including international markets. We seek growth through product
    and service innovation, market expansion, and acquisitions.
    Acquisitions have played an important part in the growth of our
    business, and we expect acquisitions to be an important part of
    our future growth. There were no material acquisitions or
    divestitures completed in 2009.

    Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 3 of the Notes to

(8.6

The $20.3 million decrease in Water Group backlog was
    primarily due to decreased backlog for the Filtration Solutions
    CodeLine product line, capacity constraints in 2008 led to above
    average backlogs, compounded by volume declines in Q4 2009.
    These decreases were partially offset by the timing of the early
    buy program shipments in residential pool markets. The
    $17.2 million decrease in the Technical Products Group
    backlog reflected declining market conditions, especially in our
    Electronics markets. Due to the relatively short manufacturing
    cycle and general industry practice for the majority of our
    businesses, backlog, which typically represents less than
    60 days of shipments, is not deemed to be material. A
    substantial portion of our revenues result from orders received
    and product sold in the same month. We expect that most of our
    backlog at December 31, 2009 will be filled in 2010.

Research
    and development

We conduct research and development activities in our own
    facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new
    products, product applications, and manufacturing processes.
    Research and development expenditures during 2009, 2008, and
    2007 were $57.9 million, $62.5 million, and
    $56.8 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7,
    and in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.



Raw
    materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of our
    products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel,
    electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies),
    and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of
    raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution
    through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are
    purchased on the open market, and the majority are available
    through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not
    experienced any significant work stoppages to-date due to
    shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments,
    principally price commitments, for the purchase of various
    component parts and raw materials and believe that it is
    unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated
    prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices
    are available for most materials for which long-term commitments
    exist, and we believe that the termination of any of these
    commitments would not have a material adverse effect on
    operations.

Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to
    market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these
    fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term
    agreements with escalator / de-escalator clauses.
    Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend
    higher in the future.

Intellectual
    property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks and trade names are
    important to our business. However, we do not regard our
    business as being materially dependent upon any single patent,
    non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer
    relationship, trade mark and trade name.

Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire
    or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with
    their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of
    patents, patent applications, and license agreements to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of December 31, 2009, we employed approximately
    13,150 people worldwide. Total employees in the United
    States were approximately 6,600, of whom approximately 530 are
    represented by five different trade unions having collective
    bargaining agreements. Generally, labor relations have been
    satisfactory.

Captive
    Insurance Subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by
    third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired
    businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain foreign
    operations are established without regard to the availability of
    insurance.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and
    warnings before making an investment decision. You are cautioned
    not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
    You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or
    identify all such factors and should not consider the following
    list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and
    uncertainties. If any of the risks described below actually
    occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations
    or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In that
    case, the price of our securities could decline and you could
    lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to
    other information set forth in this document.

General
    economic conditions, including difficult credit and residential
    construction markets, affect demand for our
    products.

We compete around the world in various geographic regions and
    product markets. Among these, the most significant are global
    industrial and commercial markets (for both the Water and
    Technical Products Groups) and residential markets (for the
    Water Group). The global recession adversely affected the
    robustness of our markets throughout 2009. Important factors
    that impact our businesses include the overall strength of the
    economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy;
    industrial and governmental capital spending; the strength of
    the residential and commercial real estate markets; unemployment
    rates; availability of consumer and commercial financing for our
    customers and end-users; and interest rates. New construction
    for residential housing and home improvement activity fell in
    each of the past three years, and particularly in 2009, which
    reduced revenue in each of the businesses within our Water Group
    over this period. We believe that weakness in the residential
    housing market and the recent dramatic slowdown in our
    industrial and commercial markets will likely continue to affect
    our revenues and margins into 2010. Any continuing weakness in
    these markets beyond 2009 will negatively affect our sales and
    financial performance in future periods.

Continuing
    market weakness is likely to limit recovery in our revenues and
    profitability from

pre-recessionary

levels.

Over the past four years, our organic growth has been generated
    in part from expanding international sales, entering new
    distribution channels, price increases and introducing new
    products. To grow more rapidly than our end markets, we would
    have to continue to expand our geographic reach, further
    diversify our distribution channels, continue to introduce new
    products, and increase sales of existing products to our
    customer base. Difficult economic and competitive factors in
    late 2008 and throughout 2009 adversely affected our ability to
    grow our revenues over this period. These economic conditions
    materially and adversely impacted our financial performance in
    2009; we did not meet our projected revenue growth or earnings
    targets for the year 2009. We believe that these market
    weaknesses have started to stabilize in many of our end markets,
    but we can not assure you that these markets will continue to
    improve nor that we will be able to increase revenues and
    profitability to match our earlier financial performance. Rather
    than focus our sales efforts primarily on broad-based revenue
    growth, we have chosen to limit our growth initiatives to
    specific end markets and geographies. We cannot assure you that
    these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue
    declines in other markets.

Our
    businesses operate in highly competitive markets, so we may be
    forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs.

Our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of
    their respective markets. Competition may force us to cut prices
    or to incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete
    on the basis of product design, quality, availability,
    performance, customer service and price. Present or future
    competitors may have greater financial, technical or other
    resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected
    business or businesses. We cannot assure you that these and
    other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
    future results of operations.



Material
    cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could
    continue to affect our results of operations.

In previous years, we have experienced material cost and other
    inflation in a number of our businesses. We are striving for
    greater productivity improvements and implementing selective
    increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in
    raw materials (especially metals and resins), energy and other
    costs such as pension, health care and insurance. While these
    inflationary pressures dramatically weakened in late 2008 and
    early 2009 as a result of general economic conditions, the
    recent reversal of material cost inflation may not be
    sustainable once the economy begins to strengthen. We also are
    continuing to implement our excellence in operations initiatives
    in order to continuously reduce our costs. We cannot assure you,
    however, that these actions will be successful in managing our
    costs or increasing our productivity. Continued cost inflation
    or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or
    improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results
    of operations.

Seasonality
    of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our
    financial results.

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment in our primary
    markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs
    from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike is
    partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or
    “early buy” programs (generally including extended
    payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts. We cannot assure you that
    seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Intellectual
    property challenges may hinder product development and
    marketing.

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks and trade names are
    important to our business. Intellectual property protection,
    however, may not preclude competitors from developing products
    similar to ours or from challenging our names or products. Over
    the past few years, we have noticed an increasing tendency for
    participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges
    to intellectual property as a means to compete. Patent and
    trademark challenges increase our costs to develop, engineer and
    market our products, and increased costs may hinder our product
    development and marketing.

Our
    results of operations may be negatively impacted by
    litigation.

Our business exposes us to potential litigation, such as product
    liability claims relating to the design, manufacture, and sale
    of our products. While we have an active product safety program,
    and we currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product
    liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will be able
    to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this
    insurance will provide adequate protection against potential
    liabilities. In addition, we self-insure a portion of product
    liability claims. A series of successful claims against us for
    significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our
    product reputation, financial condition, results of operations,
    and cash flows.

Reductions
    in our acquisition activity will likely slow our revenue growth
    or otherwise adversely affect our financial
    performance.

Over the past four years, much of our growth has resulted from
    acquisitions of businesses within our current business segments.
    While we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions in these
    segments, given the current financial and economic environment,
    we are uncertain whether we will be able to make major
    acquisitions until business conditions improve further. We
    cannot assure you that we would be able to continue to grow our
    revenue or to limit revenue declines without making
    acquisitions. Acquisitions we may undertake could have a
    material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly
    in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions,
    while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired
    businesses into our operations. Once integrated, acquired
    operations may not achieve the levels of profitability
    originally anticipated.



The
    availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on
    our financial performance.

Our plans to vigorously compete in our chosen markets will
    require additional capital for future acquisitions, capital
    expenditures, growth of working capital, and continued
    international and regional expansion. In the past, we have
    financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash from
    operations and debt financing. While we refinanced our primary
    credit agreements in the second quarter of 2007 on what we
    believe to be favorable terms, future acquisitions or other uses
    of funds may require us to expand our debt financing resources
    or to issue equity securities. Our financial results may be
    adversely affected if new financing is not available on
    favorable terms or if interest costs under our debt financings
    are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other
    internal growth. In addition, future share issuances could be
    dilutive to your equity investment if we sell shares into the
    market or issue additional stock as consideration in any
    acquisition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to issue
    equity securities or obtain future debt financing at favorable
    terms. Without sufficient financing, we will not be able to
    pursue our targeted growth strategy, and our acquisition
    program, which will limit our revenue growth and future
    financial performance.

We are
    exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from
    operating a multinational business.

Sales outside of the United States, including export sales from
    our domestic businesses, accounted for approximately 34% of our
    net sales in 2009, down from 35% in 2008. Further, most of our
    businesses obtain some products, components and raw materials
    from foreign suppliers. Accordingly, our business is subject to
    the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in
    operating in numerous countries. These risks include:

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in
    countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;

•

relatively more severe economic conditions in some international
    markets than in the United States;

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing
    requirements;

•

the possibility of terrorist action against us or our operations;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other trade
    restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in

non-U.S. labor

markets;

•

changes in tax laws or rulings could have an adverse impact on
    our effective tax rate;

•

the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in foreign
    countries; and

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations.

Our business success depends in part on our ability to
    anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We
    cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a
    material adverse effect on our international operations or on
    our business as a whole.

Our
    international operations are subject to foreign market and
    currency fluctuation risks.

We expect the percentage of our sales outside of North America
    to increase in the future. Over the past few years, the
    economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do
    business have had slower growth than the U.S. economy. The
    European Union currently accounts for the majority of our
    foreign sales and income, in which our most significant European
    market is Germany; each market area is currently experiencing
    similar economic difficulties to those in the United States, and
    sales in those markets slowed significantly through 2009. In
    addition, we have a significant and growing business in the
    Asia-Pacific area, but the economic conditions in countries in
    this region are subject to different growth expectations, market
    weaknesses and business practices. We cannot predict how
    changing market conditions in these regions will impact our
    financial results.



We are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign
    currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results.
    In 2009, the weakness of the US dollar slightly benefited our
    financial results in foreign jurisdictions. We are uncertain
    whether weakness in the US dollar will continue, and if so, the
    extent to which it may hurt our financial results on a
    comparative basis. In addition, we source certain products,
    components and raw materials throughout the world, the import of
    which into the United States has raised the cost of these goods
    in US dollars and has impacted the results of our domestic
    businesses as well.

We
    have significant goodwill and intangible assets, and future
    impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a
    material negative impact on our financial results.

We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment on an annual basis as required by the accounting
    guidance, by comparing the estimated fair value of each of our
    reporting units to their respective carrying values on our
    balance sheet. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets
    are evaluated for impairment annually as of the first day of our
    third quarter using management’s operating budget and
    internal five-year forecast to estimate expected future cash
    flows. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to
    make significant estimates regarding future revenues and
    expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working
    capital and the appropriate discount rate. The projections also
    take into account several factors including current and
    estimated economic trends and outlook, costs of raw materials,
    and consideration of our market capitalization in comparison to
    the estimated fair values of our reporting units. During the
    fourth quarter of 2009, we completed our annual impairment test
    for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and recorded
    an impairment charge of $11.3 million to write-down certain
    trade name intangible assets to their current estimated fair
    value.

At December 31, 2009 our goodwill and intangible assets
    were approximately $2,575.2 million, and represented
    approximately 65.8% of our total assets. If we experience
    further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet
    our operating forecasts, we may be subject to future
    impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the
    future performance of our businesses, increases in the discount
    rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our
    businesses, or significant declines in our stock price could be
    indicators of impairment losses. Because of the significance of
    our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of
    these assets could have a material adverse effect on our
    financial results.

We are
    exposed to potential environmental and other laws, liabilities
    and litigation.

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
    regulations governing our environmental practices, public and
    worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment.
    Compliance with these environmental, health and safety
    regulations could require us to satisfy environmental
    liabilities, increase the cost of manufacturing our products or
    otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Any violations of these laws by us could
    cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our
    operating results and cause our business to suffer. We are also
    required to comply with various environmental laws and maintain
    permits, some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from
    time to time, for many of our businesses, and we could suffer if
    we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any
    additional permits that we may require.

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a number of
    environmental

clean-ups

relating to our current or former business units. We have
    disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and, in
    certain cases, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers. We
    may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing
    business units, as well as both divested and acquired
    businesses. We have also made claims against third parties for
    indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental
    remediations or other obligations. We cannot assure you that we
    will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for
    such costs.

We cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not
    change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual
    environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.



We may
    be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to
    climate change.

Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide.
    Many scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming
    to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon
    dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory
    efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. There are a number of
    pending legislative and regulatory proposals to address
    greenhouse gas emissions. For example, in June 2009 the
    U.S. House of Representatives passed the American Clean
    Energy and Security Act that would phase-in significant
    reductions in greenhouse gas emissions if enacted into law. The
    U.S. Senate is considering a different bill, and it is
    uncertain whether, when and in what form a federal mandatory
    carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted.
    Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol,
    and this and other international initiatives under consideration
    could affect our international operations. These actions could
    increase costs associated with our operations, including costs
    for raw materials and transportation. Because it is uncertain
    what laws will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential
    impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Provisions
    of our Restated Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Minnesota
    law could deter takeover attempts.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under
    Minnesota law, and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent
    or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.

Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include
    provisions relating to the election, appointment and removal of
    directors, as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting
    requirements which could delay, prevent or make more difficult a
    merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control.
    In addition, our common share purchase rights could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us, which could deter some acquirers from making
    takeover proposals or tender offers. Also, the Minnesota
    Business Corporations Act contains control share acquisition and
    business combination provisions which could delay, prevent or
    make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
    other change of control. Our shareholders might view any such
    transaction as being in their best interests since the
    transaction could result in a higher stock price than the
    current market price for our common stock.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is in leased premises located in
    Golden Valley, Minnesota. We carry out our Water Group
    manufacturing operations at 27 plants located throughout the
    United States and at 14 plants located in 10 other countries. In
    addition, our Water Group has 22 distribution facilities and 40
    sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the
    world. We carry out our Technical Products Group manufacturing
    operations at 7 plants located throughout the United States and
    10 plants located in 8 other countries. In addition, our
    Technical Products Group has 8 distribution facilities and 25
    sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their
    purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We accrue for potential environmental losses in a manner
    consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States; that is, we record liabilities for an estimated
    loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is
    probable and can be reasonably estimated. Factors that are
    considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual
    have been met include the (a) nature of the litigation,
    claim, or assessment, (b) progress



of the case, including progress after the date of the financial
    statements but before the issuance date of the financial
    statements, (c) opinions of legal counsel, and
    (d) management’s intended response to the litigation,
    claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable estimate of the
    probable loss is a range, we record the most likely estimate of
    the loss. When no amount within the range is a better estimate
    than any other amount, however, the minimum amount in the range
    is accrued. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal
    Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in the past years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at
    the sites. We have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for remediation costs at these sites. We do not believe
    that projected response costs will result in a material
    liability. We have also made claims against third parties for
    indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental
    remediations or other obligations. We cannot assure you that we
    will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for
    such costs.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $2.3 million and
    $3.1 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a
    liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the
    claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is
    probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of
    the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing
    information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as
    additional information becomes available. We have not
    experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the
    severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal
    injury claims.

    Report on

Form 10-K

is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be

The following graph sets forth the cumulative total shareholder
    return on our common stock for the last five years, assuming the
    investment of $100 on December 31, 2004 and the
    reinvestment of all dividends since that date to
    December 31, 2009. The graph also contains for comparison
    purposes the S&P 500 Index and the S&P MidCap 400
    Index, assuming the same investment level and reinvestment of
    dividends.

By virtue of our market capitalization, we are a component of
    the S&P MidCap 400 Index. On the basis of our size and
    diversity of businesses, we have not found a readily
    identifiable peer group. We believe the S&P MidCap 400
    Index is an appropriate comparison. We have evaluated other
    published indices, but have determined that the results are
    skewed by significantly larger companies included in the
    indices. We believe such a comparison would not be meaningful.

    and Electronic Solutions businesses. In February and April 2007,
    we acquired the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jung Pump
    and all of the capital interests of Porous Media, respectively,
    as part of our Water Group. In May 2007, we acquired as part of
    our Technical Products Group the assets of Calmark. In June
    2008, we entered into a transaction with GE that was accounted
    for as an acquisition of an 80.1 percent ownership interest
    in GE’s global water softener and residential water
    filtration business in exchange for a 19.9 percent interest
    in our global water softener and residential water filtration
    business.

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company
    comprised of two operating segments: Water and Technical
    Products. Our Water Group is a global leader in providing
    innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement,
    storage, treatment and enjoyment of water. Our Technical
    Products Group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal
    management markets, designing and manufacturing standard,
    modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive
    electronics and electrical components and protect the people
    that use them. In 2010, we expect our Water Group and Technical
    Products Group to generate approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of our
    total revenues, respectively.

Our Water Group has progressively become a more important part
    of our business portfolio with sales increasing from
    approximately $125 million in 1995 to approximately
    $1.8 billion in 2009. We believe the water industry is
    structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for
    clean water and the large global market size (of which we have
    identified a target market totaling $60 billion). Our
    vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products
    and systems used in the movement, storage, treatment and
    enjoyment of water.

On February 28, 2008, we sold our NPT business to Pool
    Corporation in a cash transaction. The results of NPT have been
    reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
    The assets and liabilities of NPT have been reclassified as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented.

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 80.1 percent
    ownership interest in GE’s global water softener and
    residential water filtration business in exchange for a
    19.9 percent interest in our global water softener and
    residential water filtration business. The acquisition was
    effected through the formation of two new entities, a
    U.S. entity and an international entity, (collectively
    “Pentair Residential Filtration” or “PRF”)
    into which we and GE contributed certain assets, properties,
    liabilities and operations representing our respective global
    water softener and residential water filtration businesses. We
    are an 80.1 percent owner of the new entities and GE is a
    19.9 percent owner.

With the formation of PRF, we believe we are better positioned
    to serve residential customers with industry-leading technical
    applications in the areas of water conditioning, whole house
    filtration, point of use water management and water
    sustainability and expect to accelerate revenue growth by
    selling GE’s existing residential conditioning products
    through our sales channels.

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa/Bath business to
    Balboa Water Group in a cash transaction. The results of
    Spa/Bath have been reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. The assets and liabilities of Spa/Bath have
    been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented.

Our Technical Products Group operates in a large global market
    with significant potential for growth in industry segments such
    as energy, medical and security and defense. We believe we have
    the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in
    North America for enclosures and the highest brand recognition
    in the industry in North America. From mid-2001 through 2003,
    the Technical Products Group experienced significantly lower
    sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending
    in the industrial and commercial markets and over-capacity and
    weak demand in the data communication and telecommunication



markets. From 2004 through 2008, sales volumes increased due to
    the addition of new distributors, new products, price increases
    and higher demand in targeted markets. In 2009, sales revenues
    in our Technical Products Group declined significantly due to
    the impact of the global recession.

Key
    Trends and Uncertainties

Our sales revenue for the full year of 2009 was approximately
    $2.7 billion, decreasing 20% from sales in the prior year.
    Our Water Group sales declined 16% in the year to approximately
    $1.8 billion, compared to the same period in 2008. Our
    Technical Products Group sales decreased 26% to approximately
    $0.8 billion in 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.

The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial
    performance in 2009 and will likely impact our results in 2010
    and beyond:

•

Most markets we serve slowed dramatically in late 2008 and
    throughout 2009 as a result of the global recession. These
    markets are showing signs of stabilizing, although at lower
    levels than we expected would be the case twelve months ago. In
    response to market conditions over the past year, we
    significantly restructured our operations to both reduce cost
    and reduce or relocate capacity. Because our businesses are
    significantly affected by general economic trends, further
    deterioration in our most important markets addressed below
    would likely have an adverse impact on our results of operation
    for 2010 and beyond.

•

We have also identified specific market opportunities that we
    have been and are pursuing that we find attractive, both within
    and outside the United States. We are reinforcing our businesses
    to more effectively address these opportunities through research
    and development and additional sales and marketing resources.
    Unless we successfully penetrate these product and geographic
    markets, our organic growth will be limited due to continuing
    stagnation or slower growth in other markets.

•

New home building and new pool starts have contracted for each
    of the past four years in the United States and have slowed
    significantly in Europe as well. Overall, we believe
    approximately 55% of sales by our water businesses (flow,
    filtration and pool equipment) are used in residential
    applications — for new construction, remodeling and
    repair, replacement and refurbishment. We saw some stabilization
    of order rates in the second half of 2009 and anticipate
    continuing stability, but not significant volume increases, in
    2010. We do believe that housing construction will improve in
    2010 from historically low levels in 2009, and we anticipate a
    slightly stronger market will have a favorable impact on these
    businesses, but our participation in trends appears to lag
    approximately six months from inception.

•

Industrial, communications and commercial markets for all of our
    businesses, including commercial and industrial construction,
    also slowed significantly over the past year. Order rates and
    sales stabilized in our industrial and communications businesses
    somewhat in the fourth quarter, although commercial and
    industrial construction markets are still shrinking. We believe
    that the outlook for most of these markets is mixed, and we
    expect that construction will continue to decline over 10% year
    over year in 2010.

•

We experienced material cost and other deflation in a number of
    our businesses during 2009. We expect the current economic
    environment will result in continuing price volatility for many
    of our raw materials. We believe that the impact of lower
    commodity prices will continue to impact us favorably in the
    first half of 2010, but we are uncertain on the timing and
    impact of a return of cost inflation as the economy improves
    over the next year.

•

Our unfunded pension liability increased in 2008 from
    $147 million to $257 million, primarily reflecting our
    reduced investment return and significantly lower asset values
    in our U.S. defined benefit plans at the end of that year.
    Primarily as a result of better investment returns and higher
    contributions in 2009, our unfunded pension liabilities declined
    to approximately $223 million as of the end of 2009. The
    contributions included a discretionary contribution of
    $25 million in December to improve plan balances and reduce
    future contributions. We anticipate that our future pension
    expense will increase over 2009 levels.

•

We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of our net income. We
    define free cash flow as cash flow from continuing operating
    activities less capital



expenditures plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment.
    Free cash flow for the full year 2009 was approximately
    $207 million, or 179% of our net income; this amount was
    below our target of $225 million. The shortfall reflects
    the discretionary contribution to our pension plan of
    $25 million in December 2009, which we undertook in large
    part because of our somewhat higher than anticipated free cash
    flow for the fourth quarter and full year. In addition, we did
    not sell customer receivables in 2009 as we have in prior years.
    Our target for free cash flow in 2010 continues to be greater
    than or equal to 100% conversion of our net income for the year.
    Last year, we instituted several measures internally to maintain
    our strong collection experience and to decrease working
    capital. We are continuing to target reductions in working
    capital, and particularly inventory, as a percentage of sales.
    See our discussion of

Other financial measures

under the
    caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this
    report.

•

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is normally at seasonal highs from April to
    August. The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated
    by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and
    weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts.
    We believe that this seasonality will continue in the second and
    third quarters of 2010, as it did modestly in 2009, but are
    uncertain of the size and impact of the seasonal spike for the
    year, and contemplate that any seasonal impact will likely be
    less than we have historically seen.

•

We experienced year over year unfavorable foreign currency
    effects on net sales and operating results in 2008 and 2009, as
    a result of the weakening of the U.S. dollar in relation to
    other foreign currencies. Due to recent strength in the US
    dollar, we anticipate some modest unfavorable foreign exchange
    impact, but believe longer-term that foreign exchange will be
    favorable. Our currency effect is primarily for the
    U.S. dollar against the euro, which may or may not trend
    favorably in the future.

•

The effective income tax rate for 2009 was 32.7%. We estimate
    our effective tax rate for the full year 2010 to be between 32%
    and 34%. We continue to actively pursue initiatives to reduce
    our effective tax rate. The tax rate in any quarter can be
    affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are
    required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution.

Outlook

In 2010, our operating objectives include the following:

•

Increasing our vertical market focus within each of our Global
    Business Units to grow in those markets in which we have
    competitive advantages;

•

Leveraging our technological capabilities to increasingly
    generate innovative new products;

•

Driving operating excellence through lean enterprise
    initiatives, with special focus on sourcing and supply
    management, cash flow management, and lean operations; and

•

Stressing proactive talent development, particularly in
    international management and other key functional areas.

On February 2, 2010, we announced our results of operations
    for fiscal year 2009 and our earnings guidance for the first
    quarter of 2010 of a range of $0.32 to $0.35 per share on a
    diluted basis for the full year 2010 of a range of $1.75 to
    $1.90 per share on a diluted basis. Prior full year guidance was
    to equal $1.70 per share or higher on a fully-diluted basis. We
    are uncertain of the trajectory of the economic recovery, both
    in the United States and globally, for the balance of the year
    and on into 2011. As noted above, significant deterioration in
    general economic conditions in our primary markets and
    geographies would adversely impact our anticipated annual
    revenues and financial performance.

This outlook is based on several variables. First, our guidance
    anticipates modest organic revenue gains in our businesses as a
    whole in the

low-to-mid

single digit range as a result of overall market conditions,
    which we expect to bring our total revenue to approximately
    $2.8 billion for the full year. Second, based upon that



revenue expectation, we project net earnings of $1.75 to $1.90
    per share as a result of higher operating margins due to
    carryover of productivity gains from our restructuring projects
    in 2009 and favorable commodities pricing in the first half of
    2010, offset somewhat by reinstatement of certain employee
    benefits and wage increases and higher spending on research and
    development, and sales and marketing resources. Third, we
    believe our tax rate and pension expense will be slightly higher
    than in 2009, with some reduction in interest expense as a
    result of lower borrowing levels and continuing low interest
    rates. We also believe that should we experience volume gains in
    excess of those we are projecting, we will be able to convert
    those extra revenues into operating income at an approximate 40%
    rate, consistent with our productivity assumptions.

Our guidance assumes an absence of significant acquisitions or
    divestitures in 2010. We continue to look for smaller
    acquisitions to expand our geographic reach internationally,
    expand our presence in our various channels to market and
    acquire technologies and products to broaden our
    businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets. We
    may also consider the divestiture or closure of discrete
    business units to further focus our businesses on their most
    attractive markets.

The ability to achieve our operating objectives and 2010
    guidance will depend, to a certain extent, on factors outside
    our control. See “Risk Factors” under Part I of
    this report.

The
    19.7 percent decrease in consolidated net sales in 2009
    from 2008 was primarily the result of:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the downturn in the North American and
    Western European residential housing markets and other global
    markets;

•

lower Technical Products Group sales in both the Electrical and
    Electronics businesses; and

•

unfavorable foreign currency effects.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases; and

•

an increase in sales volume related to the formation of PRF.

The
    2.2 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2008 from
    2007 was primarily the result of:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases;

•

an increase in sales volume due to the formation of PRF and our
    February 2, 2007 acquisition of Jung Pump and our
    April 30, 2007 acquisition of Porous Media;

•

favorable foreign currency effects; and

•

higher Technical Products Group sales.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    related to the downturn in the North American residential
    housing market throughout 2008 and other global markets starting
    in the fourth quarter of 2008.

Water

The
    16.2 percent decrease in Water Group sales in 2009 from
    2008 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales decline (excluding acquisitions and foreign
    currency exchange) of 16.1% primarily due to lower sales of
    certain pump, pool and filtration products primarily related to
    the downturn in the North American and Western European
    residential housing markets and other global markets; and

•

unfavorable foreign currency effects.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases; and

•

an increase in sales volume due to the formation of PRF.

The
    1.1 percent decrease in Water Group sales in 2008 from 2007
    was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales decline (excluding acquisitions and foreign
    currency exchange) of 5.1% for the full year 2008, which
    included:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products into
    North American and Western European residential housing
    markets; and

•

second quarter 2007 sales of municipal pumps related to a large
    flood control project that did not recur in 2008.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases; and

•

continued growth in China and in other markets in Asia-Pacific
    as well as continued success in penetrating markets in Europe
    and the Middle East.

These
    decreases were further offset by:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by the formation of PRF and
    our 2007 acquisitions of Jung Pump and Porous Media; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

Technical
    Products

The
    26.3 percent decrease in Technical Products Group sales in
    2009 from 2008 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales decline (excluding foreign currency exchange) of
    25.4% primarily related to:

•

a decrease in sales to electrical markets resulting from lower
    capital spending by customers in the industrial vertical market;

•

a decrease in sales to electronics markets that was largely
    attributable to reduced spending in the communications and
    general electronics vertical markets; and



•

unfavorable foreign currency effects.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases.

The
    9.1 percent increase in Technical Products Group sales in
    2008 from 2007 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales into electrical markets, which includes new
    products and selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases;

•

an increase in sales into electronics markets as sales to our
    datacommunication and telecommunications customers rebounded and
    we expanded into other vertical markets;

•

strong sales performance in Asia and Europe; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

an organic sales decline in our North American electronics
    markets.

The
    1.1 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percent
    of sales in 2009 from 2008 was primarily the result
    of:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the downturn in the North American and
    Western European residential housing markets and other global
    market downturns;

•

lower sales volume in our Technical Products Group and lower
    fixed cost absorption resulting from that volume decline;

•

inflationary increases related to raw materials and labor
    costs; and

•

period restructuring costs and write-offs of inventory
    associated with the consolidation of facilities.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

cost savings from restructuring actions and other personnel
    reductions taken in response to the economic downturn and
    resulting volume decline;

•

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives, including lean and
    supply management practices; and

•

higher cost of goods sold in 2008 as a result of a fair market

related to the formation of PRF.

The
    0.6 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percent
    of sales in 2008 from 2007 was primarily the result
    of:

•

inflationary increases related to raw materials and labor costs;

•

lower sales of certain, pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the downturn in the North American
    residential housing market and the slowing of residential
    markets in Western Europe;



•

higher cost of goods sold in 2008 as a result of a fair market
    value inventory

step-up

related to the formation of PRF; and

•

operating inefficiencies related to product moves and plant
    consolidations.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

the gross margin impact from increased sales volume in our
    Technical Products Group and the resulting improved fixed cost
    leverage;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and
    supply management practices; and

•

lower comparative cost in 2008 for our Jung Pump and Porous
    Media businesses due to the absence of a fair market value
    inventory

The
    0.1 percentage point increase in SG&A expense as a
    percent of sales in 2009 from 2008 was primarily the result
    of:

•

lower sales volume and the resultant loss of leverage on the

The
    2.9 percentage point decrease in Technical Products Group
    operating income as a percent of net sales in 2009 from 2008 was
    primarily the result of:

•

a decrease in sales to electrical markets resulting from lower
    capital spending by customers in the industrial vertical market;

•

a decrease in sales into electronics markets that was largely
    attributable to reduced spending in the communications and
    general electronics vertical markets;

•

lower fixed cost absorption resulting from the sales volume
    decline; and

•

incremental restructuring actions taken in 2009 and the
    associated period costs related to the closure of certain
    facilities.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

cost savings from restructuring actions and other personnel
    reductions taken in response to the current economic downturn
    and resulting volume decline;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives, including lean and

    inflationary cost increases; and

•

savings realized from the continued success of PIMS, including
    lean and supply management activities.

These

Gain
    on sale of interest in subsidiaries

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 80.1 percent
    ownership interest in GE’s global water softener and
    residential water filtration business in exchange for a
    19.9 percent interest in our global water softener and
    residential water filtration business. The acquisition was
    effected through the formation of two new entities, a
    U.S. entity and an international entity into which we and
    GE contributed certain assets, properties, liabilities and
    operations representing our respective global water softener and
    residential water filtration businesses. We are an
    80.1 percent owner of the new entities and GE is a
    19.9 percent owner. The acquisition and related sale of our
    19.9 percent interest resulted in a gain of
    $109.6 million representing the difference between the
    carrying amount and the fair value of the 19.9 percent
    interest sold.

Loss
    on early extinguishment of debt

On July 8, 2008, we commenced a cash tender offer for all
    of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal
    7.85% Senior Notes due 2009 (the “Notes”). Upon
    expiration of the tender offer on August 4, 2008, we
    purchased $116.1 million aggregate principal amount of the
    Notes. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a loss of
    $4.6 million on early extinguishment of debt in 2008. The
    loss included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized
    deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of
    $0.6 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash
    paid of $5.1 million related to the tender premium and
    other costs associated with the purchase.

On March 16, 2009, we announced the redemption of all of
    our remaining outstanding $133.9 million aggregate
    principal of Notes. The Notes were redeemed on April 15,
    2009 at a redemption price of $1,035.88 per $1,000 of principal
    outstanding plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of this
    transaction, we recognized a loss of $4.8 million on early
    extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2009. The loss
    included the



write off of $0.1 million in unamortized deferred financing
    fees in addition to recognition of $0.3 million in
    previously unrecognized swap gains, and cash paid of
    $5.0 million related to the redemption and other costs
    associated with the purchase.

The

    2008 was primarily the result of:

•

a portion of the gain on the formation of PRF in 2008 being
    taxed at a rate of 0%.

This
    increase was partially offset by:

•

favorable adjustments in 2009 related to prior years’ tax
    returns.

The 1.3 percentage point decrease in the tax rate in
    2008 from 2007 was primarily the result of:

•

higher earnings in lower-tax rate jurisdictions during
    2008; and

•

a portion of the gain on the formation of PRF taxed at a rate of
    0%.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

the impact in 2007 of a favorable adjustment related to the
    measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to account
    for changes in German tax law enacted on August 17, 2007.

We expect our full year effective tax rate in 2010 to be between
    32% and 34%. We will continue to pursue tax rate reduction
    opportunities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital
    expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments,
    dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from
    operations, availability under existing committed revolving
    credit facilities, and in certain instances, public and private
    debt and equity offerings. We have grown our businesses in
    significant part over the past few years through acquisitions,
    such as Jung Pump and Porous Media in 2007, financed by credit
    provided under our revolving credit facilities and, from time to
    time, by private or public debt issuance. Our primary revolving
    credit facilities have generally been adequate for these
    purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit
    facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions; these
    are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within
    less than a year.

In light of the current uncertain economic situation, we do not
    currently plan to make any significant acquisitions in 2010,
    although we may undertake smaller acquisitions. For the second
    year in a row, our Board did not authorize our annual share
    repurchase program that we had undertaken prior to 2009. We
    continue to focus on increasing our cash flow and maximizing
    debt repayment for the foreseeable future. Our intent is to
    maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position.

Our current $800 million multi-currency revolving credit
    facility (the “Credit Facility”) was entered into in
    the second quarter of 2007 and does not expire until
    June 4, 2012. The agent banks under the Credit Facility are
    J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank
    and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. We have ample borrowing capacity
    for our currently projected needs ($601.7 million at
    December 31, 2009 which would be limited to
    $390.2 million based on the credit agreement’s
    leverage ratio covenant).



We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal
    demand in a number of markets within our Water Group. We
    generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for
    operational purposes, which usage reverses in the second quarter
    as the seasonality of our businesses peaks. End-user demand for
    pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal
    highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike is
    partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early
    buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Operating
    activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $258.4 million in
    2009, or $54.2 million higher than in 2008. The increase in
    cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a
    reduction in working capital, offset by a discretionary pension
    contribution of $25 million and lower income from
    continuing operations.

Cash provided by operating activities was $204.2 million in
    2008, or $137.1 million lower than in 2007. The decrease in
    cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to an
    increase in working capital, higher prepaid expenses
    (particularly prepaid taxes) and lower income from continuing
    operations, excluding the gain from the formation of PRF.

In December 2008 and 2007, we sold approximately
    $44 million and $50 million, respectively, of a
    customer’s account receivable to a third-party financial
    institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk.
    Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of
    accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
    proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating
    activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2008
    and 2007, a loss in the amount of $0.5 million and
    $1.2 million, respectively, related to the sale of accounts
    receivable and is included in the line item

Other

in
    our Consolidated Statements of Income. We did not undertake a
    similar sale of customer receivables in 2009, in part because of
    lower receivable balances and higher transactions costs.

Investing
    activities

Capital expenditures in 2009, 2008, and 2007 were
    $54.1 million, $53.1 million and $61.5 million,
    respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2010
    to be approximately $55 to $65 million, primarily for
    capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing
    facilities, new product development, and general maintenance
    capital.

On May 7, 2007, we acquired as part of our Technical
    Products Group the assets of Calmark Corporation
    (“Calmark”), a privately held business, for
    $28.4 million, including a cash payment of
    $29.2 million and transaction costs of $0.2 million,
    less cash acquired of $1.0 million.

On April 30, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all of the capital interests in Porous Media, two privately held
    filtration and separation technologies businesses, for
    $224.9 million, including a cash payment of
    $225.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million,
    less cash acquired of $0.5 million.

On February 2, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jung Pump for
    $229.5 million, including a cash payment of
    $239.6 million and transaction costs of $1.3 million,
    less cash acquired of $11.4 million.

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa/Bath business to
    Balboa Water Group in a cash transaction for $9.2 million.
    The results of Spa/Bath have been reported as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities
    of Spa/Bath have been reclassified as discontinued operations
    for all periods presented.

On February 28, 2008, we sold our NPT business to Pool
    Corporation in a cash transaction for $29.8 million. The
    results of NPT have been reported as discontinued operations for
    all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of NPT have
    been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented.

Cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of
    $1.2 million in 2009 was related to various asset
    dispositions. Cash proceeds from the sale of property and
    equipment of $4.7 million in 2008 was primarily



related to the sale of a facility in our Water Group. Cash
    proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of
    $5.2 million in 2007 was primarily related to the sale of a
    facility used by our Technical Products Group.

Financing
    activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $209.1 million
    in 2009 and $217.2 in 2008 versus net cash provided by financing
    activities of $222.7 in 2007. The difference in cash usage
    between 2009 and 2008 was primarily the result of debt
    repayments in 2008. The difference in cash usage between 2008
    and 2007 was primarily attributable to three acquisitions in
    2007. Other financing activities included draw downs and
    repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our
    operations in the normal course of business, payments of
    dividends, cash used to repurchase Company stock, cash received
    from stock option exercises, and tax benefits related to
    stock-based compensation.

The Credit Facility creates an unsecured, committed revolving
    credit facility of up to $800 million, with multi-currency
    sub facilities to support investments outside the U.S. The
    Credit Facility expires on June 4, 2012. Borrowings under
    the Credit Facility bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus
    0.625%. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary
    based on our credit ratings. We believe that internally
    generated funds and funds available under our Credit Facility
    will be sufficient to support our normal operations, dividend
    payments, stock repurchases (if and when authorized) and debt
    maturities over the life of the Credit Facility.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. Our
    use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the
    relative interest rates for our paper compared to the cost of
    borrowing under our Credit Facility. As of December 31,
    2009, we had no outstanding commercial paper. As of
    December 31, 2008 we had $0.2 million of commercial
    paper outstanding. All of the commercial paper at
    December 31, 2008 was classified as long-term as we had the
    intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a
    long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

In May 2007, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with
    various institutional investors (the “Agreement”) for
    the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our
    5.87% Senior Notes (“Fixed Notes”) and
    $105 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating
    Rate Senior Notes (“Floating Notes” and with the Fixed
    Notes, the “Notes”). The Fixed Notes are due in May
    2017. The Floating Notes are due in May 2012 and bear interest
    equal to the 3 month LIBOR plus 0.50%. The Agreement
    contains customary events of default.

We used $250 million of the proceeds from the sale of the
    Notes to retire a $250 million

364-day

Term
    Loan Agreement that we entered into in April 2007, which we used
    in part to pay the cash purchase price of our Porous Media
    acquisition which closed in April 2007.

On July 8, 2008, we commenced a cash tender offer for all
    of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal of
    Notes. Upon expiration of the tender offer on August 4,
    2008, we purchased $116.1 million aggregate principal
    amount of the Notes. As a result of this transaction, we
    recognized a loss of $4.6 million on early extinguishment
    of debt in 2008. The loss included the write off of
    $0.1 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in
    addition to recognition of $0.6 million in previously
    unrecognized swap gains, and cash paid of $5.1 million
    related to the tender premium and other costs associated with
    the purchase.

On March 16, 2009, we announced the redemption of all of
    our remaining outstanding $133.9 million aggregate
    principle of Notes to take advantage of lower interest rates
    available under the Credit Facility. The Notes were redeemed on
    April 15, 2009 at a redemption price of $1,035.88 per
    $1,000 of principal outstanding plus accrued interest thereon
    utilizing funds on hand and drawings under our Credit Facility.
    No other significant debt obligations mature until 2012. As a
    result of this transaction, we recognized a loss of
    $4.8 million on early extinguishment of debt in the second
    quarter of 2009. The loss included the write off of
    $0.1 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in
    addition to recognition of $0.3 million in previously
    unrecognized swap gains, and cash paid of $5.0 million
    related to the redemption and other costs associated with the
    purchase.



Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the
    most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total
    consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated EBITDA,
    as defined) that may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. We were in
    compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of
    December 31, 2009.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $40.0 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had
    $2.1 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2009.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

Long-Term Debt

Current Rating

Rating Agency

Rating

Outlook

Standard & Poor’s

BBB-

Stable

Our long-term debt rating is an investment grade rating.
    Investment grade is a credit rating of BBB- or higher by
    Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 or higher by
    Moody’s.

On March 6, 2009, Standard & Poor’s
    (“S&P”) lowered our credit rating from BBB to
    BBB- and changed the outlook from negative to stable.
    S&P’s rating action reflects their expectation that
    the difficult global economic environment will likely delay
    improvement in our credit metrics, resulting in metrics that are
    more consistent with a BBB- rating. On May 1, 2009,
    Moody’s Investors Service affirmed its Baa3 rating and
    changed the outlook from stable to negative. Our credit rating
    continues to be an investment grade rating, which is a credit
    rating of BBB- or higher by S&P and Baa3 or higher by
    Moody’s.

We believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial
    outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or
    cost of debt. A credit rating is a current opinion of the
    creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
    financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations,
    or a specific financial program. The credit rating takes into
    consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or
    other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes
    into account the currency in which the obligation is
    denominated. The ratings outlook also highlights the potential
    direction of a short or long-term rating. It focuses on
    identifiable events and short-term trends that cause ratings to
    be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies. A
    change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is
    inevitable. Prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no
    immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of
    debt.

We issue short-term commercial paper notes that are currently
    not rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.
    Even though our short-term commercial paper is unrated, we
    believe a downgrade in our long-term debt rating could have a
    negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated
    commercial paper.

We do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long-term
    debt by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
    would substantially affect our ability to access the long-term
    debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions,
    the amount, timing and pricing of new borrowings could be
    adversely affected. If both of our long-term debt ratings were
    downgraded to below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the
    term debt capital markets would be reduced.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support
    working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest
    and service debt, and to pay dividends to shareholders annually.
    We have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash
    requirements, by using available cash and internally generated
    funds, and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit
    facilities.

We paid dividends in 2009 of $70.9 million, compared with
    $67.3 million in 2008 and $59.9 million in 2007. We
    recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2010
    from $0.72 per share in 2009 to $0.76 per share in 2010, which
    is the 34th consecutive year in which we have increased our
    dividend.

In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a
    maximum dollar limit of $50 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had purchased 1,549,893 shares
    for $50 million pursuant to this authorization. This
    authorization expired on December 31, 2008. No
    authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock
    was sought from or granted by our Board for 2009 or 2010.

In addition to the summary of significant contractual
    obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on
    outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2009,
    variable interest rate debt, including the effects of derivative
    financial instruments, was $200.5 million at a weighted
    average interest rate of 0.90%.

The estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are
    intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic
    qualified pension plan in accordance with the Pension Protection
    Act of 2006.

Pension and post retirement plan contributions are based on an
    assumed discount rate of 6.0% for all periods and an expected
    rate of return on plan assets ranging from 6.0% to 8.5%. In
    December 2009, we made a discretionary contribution of
    $25 million to our defined benefit pension plan.

The total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at
    December 31, 2009 is estimated to be approximately
    $30.0 million. We record penalties and interest related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in

Provision for income taxes

and

Net interest expense

, respectively, which is
    consistent with our past practices. As of December 31,
    2009, we had recorded approximately $0.6 million for the
    possible payment of penalties and $5.5 million related to
    the possible payment of interest.



Other
    financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based
    upon operating, investing, and financing classifications
    included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also
    measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income. We
    have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of net income. Free cash
    flow and conversion of net income are non-GAAP financial
    measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We
    believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are
    important measures of operating performance because they provide
    us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from
    operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt. In
    addition, free cash flow and conversion of net income are used
    as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives.
    Our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may
    not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
    companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash
    flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at
    the sites. We have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for remediation costs at these sites. We do not believe
    that projected response costs will result in a material
    liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with GAAP in the United States. As
    of December 31, 2009 and 2008, our undiscounted reserves
    for such environmental liabilities were approximately
    $2.3 million and $3.1 million, respectively. We cannot
    ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become
    more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.



Stand-by
    letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to
    bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties
    under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, the outstanding value of these
    instruments totaled $51.2 million and $64.5 million,
    respectively.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently
    adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be
    adopted in the future.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. Our
    significant accounting policies are more fully described in
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the
    application of significant judgment by management in selecting
    the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
    By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our
    historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our
    observance of trends in the industry, and information available
    from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an
    accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected would have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, and is
    tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The
    impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the
    first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including
    goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit, an indication that goodwill
    impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order
    to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any that
    should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is
    recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of
    that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
    by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner
    similar to a purchase price allocation.

The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a
    discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting
    discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant
    estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected
    capital expenditures, changes in working capital and the
    appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists
    of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are
    similar in size and industry. Actual results may differ from
    those used in our valuations.

In developing our discounted cash flow analysis, assumptions
    about future revenues and expenses, capital expenditures, and
    changes in working capital are based on our annual operating
    plan and long term business plan for each of our reporting
    units. These plans take into consideration numerous factors
    including historical experience, anticipated future economic
    conditions, changes in raw material prices, and growth
    expectations for the industries and end markets we participate
    in. These assumptions are determined over a five year long term
    planning period. The five year growth rates for revenues and
    operating profits vary for each reporting



unit being evaluated. Revenues and operating profit beyond 2016
    are projected to grow at a 3% perpetual growth rate for all
    reporting units.

Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into
    consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future
    cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our
    weighted-average cost of capital. We utilized a discount rate
    ranging from 12% to 13% in determining the discounted cash flows
    in our fair value analysis.

In estimating fair value using the market approach, we identify
    a group of comparable publicly-traded companies for each
    operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product
    offering. These groups of comparable companies are used to
    develop multiples based on total market-based invested capital
    as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization (EBITDA). We determine our estimated values by
    applying these comparable EBITDA multiples to the operating
    results of our reporting units. The ultimate fair value of each
    reporting unit is determined considering the results of both
    valuation methods.

Indefinite-Lived
    Intangibles

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary
    technology, and customer relationships. Identifiable intangibles
    with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable
    intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized.
    Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization
    are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization are tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if events warrant. During the fourth quarter of 2009
    and 2008, we completed our annual impairment test for those
    identifiable assets not subject to amortization and recorded
    impairment charges of $11.3 million and $1.0 million,
    respectively. These charges were recorded in

Selling, general
    and administrative

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value
    of the trade name with its carrying value. Fair value is
    measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method
    assumes the trade name has value to the extent that their owner
    is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits
    received from them. This method requires us to estimate the
    future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty
    rate and the weighted average cost of capital. The impairment
    charge was the result of significant declines in sales volume.

At December 31, 2009 our goodwill and intangible assets
    were approximately $2,575.2 million, and represented
    approximately 65.8% of our total assets. If we experience
    further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet
    our operating forecasts, we may be subject to future
    impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the
    future performance of our businesses, increases in the discount
    rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our
    businesses, or significant declines in our stock price or the
    market as a whole could result in additional impairment
    indicators. Because of the significance of our goodwill and
    intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment
    loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
    value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets
    held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that
    fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets.
    The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future
    cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
    consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from
    actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
    assumptions



including expected return on plan assets, discount rates, rate
    of increase in future compensation levels, and health care cost
    trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are
    disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 12 to the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these assumptions
    will affect pension expense, pension contributions and the
    funded status of our pension plans.

We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined
    benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in
    our balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized
    through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments
    from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our
    U.S. plans of 6.00% in 2009 and 6.50% in 2008 and 2007. The
    discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 2.00% to 6.0% in
    2009, 2.00% to 6.25% in 2008 and 2.00% to 5.25% in 2007. There
    are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate
    assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2010.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2009 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2008 and 2007. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

See ITEM 8, Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information regarding pension
    plans.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We
    are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative
    financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes
    in interest rates. Counterparties to all derivative contracts
    are major financial institutions. All instruments are entered
    into for other than trading purposes. The major accounting
    policies and utilization of these instruments is described more
    fully in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.

Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result
    in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement. In this
    case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable
    interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are
    at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for
    $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus .60% for
    $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all
    of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to
    continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if
    we continue to be in a net pay position.

Interest
    rate risk

Our debt portfolio, excluding impact of swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2009 was comprised of debt predominantly
    denominated in U.S. dollars. This debt portfolio is
    comprised of 50% fixed-rate debt and 50%



variable-rate debt, not considering the effects of our interest
    rate swaps. Taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap
    agreements we entered with an effective date of April 2006 and
    August 2007, our debt portfolio is comprised of 75% fixed-rate
    debt and 25% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have
    different impacts on the fixed and variable-rate portions of our
    debt portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion
    of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact
    on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates
    on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the
    interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net
    financial instrument position.

Based on the fixed-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, as
    of December 31, 2009, a 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates would result in a $20.0 million
    increase or decrease in fair value.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio,
    including the interest rate swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2009, a 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates would result in a $2.0 million
    increase or decrease in interest incurred.

Foreign
    currency risk

We conduct business in various locations throughout the world
    and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of
    foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the
    U.S. dollar. We generally do not use derivative financial
    instruments to manage these risks. The functional currencies of
    our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the
    country of domicile. We manage these operating activities at the
    local level and revenues, costs, assets, and liabilities are
    generally denominated in local currencies, thereby mitigating
    the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange. However,
    our results of operations and assets and liabilities are
    reported in U.S. dollars and thus will fluctuate with
    changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the
    U.S. dollar.



ITEM 8.
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
    and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
    subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
    reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
    believes that, as of December 31, 2009, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of year ended December 31, 2009. That
    attestation report is set forth immediately following this
    management report.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2009, of the Company and our report
    dated February 23, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion
    on those consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule and included an explanatory paragraph
    regarding the Company’s adoption of a new accounting
    standard.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial
    statements, the Company changed its method of accounting and
    reporting for noncontrolling interests for all periods presented.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2009, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 23, 2010 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements

1. Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31.

We
    report our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending
    on a Saturday.

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and

non-U.S.,

that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own 20% to
    50% of the voting stock or have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies of
    the investee are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting and, as a result, our share of the earnings or losses
    of such equity affiliates is included in the statement of income.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates,
    actual results reported in future periods may be based upon
    amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical
    accounting policies that require our most significant estimates
    and judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including
    goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in
    making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue
    recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has
    been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery has occurred
    (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to
    the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold
    other than warranty obligations in the normal, ordinary course
    of business. In the event significant post-shipment obligations
    were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until
    substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Sales
    returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly with our
    customers. Our return policy allows for customer returns only
    upon our authorization. Goods returned must be product we
    continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of
    custom or modified goods are normally not allowed. At the time
    of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect of returns.
    Estimated sales returns include consideration of historical
    sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical sales
    return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type of
    customer, and a projection of this experience into the future.

Pricing
    and sales incentives

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
    and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements,
    promotions, and other volume-based incentives at the later of
    the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered.
    Sales incentives given to our customers are recorded as a
    reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable
    benefit for the goods or services in exchange for the
    consideration and (2) we



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received.
    The following represents a description of our pricing
    arrangements, promotions, and other volume-based incentives:

Pricing
    arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers, and we
    record sales at the agreed upon net selling price. However, one
    of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a
    percentage of the original purchase price if they can
    demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM customer. At the time of
    sale, we estimate the anticipated refund to be paid based on
    historical experience and reduce sales for the probable cost of
    the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a
    reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as
    cooperative advertising. Under our cooperative advertising
    programs, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of
    sales as an allowance that may be used to advertise and promote
    our products. The customer is generally not required to provide
    evidence of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the
    cost of this cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The
    cost of this program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based
    incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front
    with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer
    achieves a specified cumulative level of sales or sales
    increase. Under these incentive programs, at the time of sale,
    we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on
    forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least
    quarterly for each customer, and sales are reduced for the
    anticipated cost of the rebate. If the forecasted sales for a
    customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect
    the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

Shipping
    and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
    recorded in

Net sales

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by
    Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

Cost of goods sold

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Cash
    equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities
    of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade
    receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts; reducing our
    receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from
    our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience,
    current trends, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic
    credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition.
    We generally do not require collateral. One customer had a
    receivable balance of approximately 10% of the total net
    receivable balance as of December 31, 2009. No customer
    receivable balances exceeded 10% of total net receivable
    balances as of December 31, 2008.

In December 2008 and 2007, we sold approximately
    $44 million and $50 million, respectively, of one
    customer’s accounts receivable to a third-party financial
    institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk.
    Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of
    accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
    proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating
    activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2008
    and 2007, a loss in the amount of $0.5 million and
    $1.2 million related to the sale of accounts receivable is
    included in the line item

Other

in our Consolidated
    Statements of Income. We did not undertake a similar sale of
    customer receivables in 2009.

    (continued)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
    substantially all costed using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and with an insignificant
    amount of inventories located outside the United States costed
    using a moving average method which approximates FIFO.

Property,
    plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at historical cost. We
    compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the
    following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or
    extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for
    repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When
    property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
    and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group,
    an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between
    estimated fair value and carrying value. Impairment losses on
    long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar
    manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to
    dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us
    to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived
    assets.

Goodwill
    and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, and is
    tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The
    impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the
    first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including
    goodwill. This non-recurring fair value measurement is a
    “Level 3” measurement under the fair value
    hierarchy described below. If the estimated fair value is less
    than the carrying amount of the reporting unit, an indication
    that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be
    completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill
    impairment, if any that should be recorded. In the second step,
    an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied
    fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill
    is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit
    in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation.

The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a
    discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting
    discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant
    estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected
    capital expenditures, changes in working capital and the
    appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists
    of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are
    similar in size and industry. Actual results may differ from
    those used in our valuations.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

In developing our discounted cash flow analysis, assumptions
    about future revenues and expenses, capital expenditures, and
    changes in working capital, are based on our annual operating
    plan and long term business plan for each of our reporting
    units. These plans take into consideration numerous factors
    including historical experience, anticipated future economic
    conditions, changes in raw material prices, and growth
    expectations for the industries and end markets we participate
    in. These assumptions are determined over a five year long term
    planning period. The five year growth rates for revenues and
    operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated.
    Revenues and operating profit beyond 2016 are projected to grow
    at a 3% perpetual growth rate for all reporting units.

Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into
    consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future
    cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our
    weighted-average cost of capital. We utilized a discount rate
    ranging from 12% to 13% in determining the discounted cash flows
    in our fair value analysis.

In estimating fair value using the market approach, we identify
    a group of comparable publicly-traded companies for each
    operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product
    offering. These groups of comparable companies are used to
    develop multiples based on total market-based invested capital
    as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization (EBITDA). We determine our estimated values by
    applying these comparable EBITDA multiples to the operating
    results of our reporting units. The ultimate fair value of each
    reporting unit is determined considering the results of both
    valuation methods.

We completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment
    evaluation during the fourth quarter with each reporting
    unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value.
    Accordingly, step two of the impairment analysis was not
    required.

Identifiable
    intangible assets

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary
    technology, and customer relationships. Identifiable intangibles
    with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable
    intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized.
    Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization
    are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization are tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if events warrant. During the fourth quarter of 2009
    and 2008, we completed our annual impairment test for those
    identifiable assets not subject to amortization and recorded
    impairment charges of $11.3 million and $1.0 million,
    respectively, related to trade names. These charges were
    recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value
    of the trade name with its carrying value. Fair value is
    measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method
    assumes the trade name has value to the extent that their owner
    is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits
    received from them. This method requires us to estimate the
    future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty
    rate and the weighted average cost of capital. This
    non-recurring fair value measurement is a
    “Level 3” measurement under the fair value
    hierarchy described below. The impairment charge was the result
    of significant declines in sales volume. These charges were
    recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

At December 31, 2009 our goodwill and intangible assets
    were approximately $2,575.2 million, and represented
    approximately 65.8% of our total assets. If we experience
    further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet
    our operating forecasts, we may be subject to future
    impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the
    future performance of our businesses, increases in the discount
    rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our
    businesses, or significant declines in our stock price or the
    market as a whole could result in additional impairment
    indicators. Because of the significance of our goodwill and
    intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial results.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

    (continued)

Equity
    method investments

We have investments that are accounted using the equity method.
    Our proportionate share of income or losses from investments
    accounted for under the equity method is recorded in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. We write down or write off an
    investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances
    indicate there is impairment in the investment that is

other-than-temporary.

This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the
    investees’ financial condition and in certain cases the
    possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the
    investees’ historical and projected results of operations
    and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are
    significantly different from projections, we may incur future
    charges for the impairment of these investments.

Income
    taxes

We use the asset and liability approach to account for income
    taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
    the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are
    reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
    management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in
    valuation allowances from period to period are included in our
    tax provision in the period of change. We recognize the effect
    of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely
    than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are
    measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely
    of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are
    reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

Environmental

We recognize environmental

clean-up

liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not
    subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental

clean-up

is
    estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based
    on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the
    estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the
    likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible
    parties (“PRPs”) will be able to fulfill their
    commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and
    severally liable. The process of estimating environmental

clean-up

liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and
    extent of historical information and physical data relating to a
    contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty
    as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the
    outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs
    at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or
    regulations, advances in

clean-up

technologies, and additional information about the ultimate

clean-up

remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.
    Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in

Other
    current liabilities

and

Other non-current liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance
    subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, reserves
    for policy claims were $56.3 million ($10.0 million
    included in A

ccrued product claims and warranties

and
    $46.3 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

) and $59.2 million ($10.0 million
    included in

Accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $49.2 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

), respectively.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

Stock-based
    compensation

We account for stock-based compensation awards on a fair value
    basis. The estimated grant date fair value of each stock-based
    award is recognized in income on an accelerated basis over the
    requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The
    estimated fair value of each option is calculated using the
    Black-Scholes option-pricing model. From time to time, we have
    elected to modify the terms of the original grant. These
    modified grants are accounted for as a new award and measured
    using the fair value method, resulting in the inclusion of
    additional compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements
    of Income. Restricted share awards and units are recorded as
    compensation cost over the requisite service periods based on
    the market value on the date of grant.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
    by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
    including the dilutive effects of common stock equivalents. The
    dilutive effects of stock options and restricted share awards
    and units increased weighted average common shares outstanding
    by 1,107 thousand, 1,181 thousand and 1,443 thousand in 2009,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings
    per share because the exercise price was greater than the
    average market price of the common shares were 5,283 thousand,
    5,268 thousand, and 2,841 thousand in 2009, 2008 and 2007,
    respectively.

Derivative
    financial instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other
    contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative is designated as
    a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If
    the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow
    hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded
    in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are
    recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the
    hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged
    transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge becomes ineffective,
    all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have
    not been settled are recognized in current earnings. For a
    derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a
    hedge, changes in fair value are reported in earnings
    immediately.

We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
    interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of
    ongoing business operations. We do not hold or issue derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All
    other contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition
    of a derivative also meet the requirements of, and have been
    designated as, normal purchases or sales. Our policy is not to
    enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as
    normal purchases or sales.

Fair
    value measurements

The accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that
    would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
    liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
    at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair
    value are classified using the following hierarchy, which is
    based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the
    measurement date:

Level 1:

Valuation is based on observable
    inputs such as quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2:

Valuation is based on inputs
    such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities
    in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the
    asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the financial instrument.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

Level 3:

Valuation is based upon other
    unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value
    measurement.

In making fair value measurements, observable market data must
    be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value
    fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within
    which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the
    lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

Foreign
    currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the
    United States are measured using the local currency as the
    functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the
    balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at
    average monthly rates of exchange. The resultant translation
    adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

New
    accounting standards

In June 2009, the FASB issued an amendment to the accounting and
    disclosure requirements for the consolidation of variable
    interest entities. The guidance affects the overall
    consolidation analysis and requires enhanced disclosures on
    involvement with variable interest entities. The guidance is
    effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2009. We are evaluating the impact the new guidance will have on
    our consolidated financial statements.

On January 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance that
    changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests.
    Minority interests have been recharacterized as noncontrolling
    interests and are reported as a component of equity separate
    from the parent’s equity. Purchases or sales of equity
    interests that do not result in a change in control will be
    accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income
    attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
    consolidated net income on the face of the Consolidated Income
    Statement and upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as well
    as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value with
    any gain or loss recognized in earnings. We have classified
    noncontrolling interest (previously minority interest) as a
    component of equity for all periods presented.

In December 2008, we adopted new accounting guidance that
    requires more detailed disclosures about employers’ pension
    plan assets. New disclosures include more information on
    investment strategies, major categories of plan assets,
    concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation
    techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets. This
    new standard required new disclosures only, and had no impact on
    our consolidated financial position, results of operations or
    cash flows. These new disclosures are included in Note 12
    to the Consolidated Financial Statements.

Subsequent
    events

In connection with preparing the audited consolidated financial
    statements for the year ended December 31, 2009, we have
    evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and
    disclosure through the date of this filing.

2. Acquisitions

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    Water & Process Technologies (a unit of General
    Electric Company) (“GE”) that was accounted for as an
    acquisition of an 80.1 percent ownership interest in
    GE’s global water softener and residential water filtration
    business in exchange for a 19.9 percent interest in our
    global water softener and residential water filtration business.
    The acquisition was effected through the formation of two new
    entities (collectively, “Pentair Residential
    Filtration” or “PRF”), a U.S. entity and an
    international entity, into which we and GE contributed certain
    assets, properties, liabilities and operations representing our
    respective global water softener and residential water
    filtration businesses. We are an 80.1 percent owner of PRF
    and GE is a 19.9 percent owner. The fair value of the
    acquisition was $229.2 million, which includes
    approximately $3.3 million of acquisition related costs.
    The acquisition and



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

related sale of our 19.9 percent interest resulted in a
    gain of $109.6 million ($85.8 million after tax),
    representing the difference between the carrying amount and the
    fair value of the 19.9 percent interest sold.

With the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration, we believe
    we are better positioned to serve residential customers with
    industry-leading technical applications in the areas of water
    conditioning, whole-house filtration, point of use water
    management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate
    revenue growth by selling GE’s existing residential
    conditioning products through our sales channels.

The fair value of the 80.1% interest in the global water
    softener and residential water filtration business of GE Water
    and Process Technologies acquired was determined using both an
    income approach and a market approach. The income approach
    utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis based on certain key
    assumptions including a discount rate based on a computed
    weighted average cost of capital and expected long-term revenue
    and expense growth rates. The market approach indicates the fair
    value of a business based on a comparison of the business to
    guideline publicly traded companies and transactions in its
    industry.

The fair value of the business acquired was allocated to the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated
    fair values. The excess of the fair value acquired over the
    identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
    reflected as goodwill. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase
    price allocation was approximately $137.9 million, none of
    which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired
    as part of the acquisition were $66.5 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as customer relationships,
    proprietary technology and trade names with a weighted average
    amortization period of approximately 15 years.

The following pro forma consolidated condensed financial results
    of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 is

Restructuring

During 2009 and 2008, we announced and initiated certain
    business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed
    cost structure and rationalizing our manufacturing footprint.
    These initiatives included the announcement of the closure of
    certain manufacturing facilities as well as the reduction in
    hourly and salaried headcount of approximately 800 and
    1700 employees in 2009 and 2008, respectively, which
    included 350 and 1,300 in the Water Group and 450 and 400 in the
    Technical Products Group. These actions were generally completed
    by the end of 2009.

Restructuring related costs included in

Selling, general and

expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
    Income include costs for severance and related benefits, asset
    impairment charges and other restructuring costs as follows:

Intangible asset amortization expense in 2009, 2008, and 2007
    was $27.3 million, $24.0 million, and
    $21.8 million, respectively.

In 2009 we recorded an impairment charge to write down trade
    name intangible assets of $11.3 million in the Water Group.
    Additionally, in 2008 we recorded an impairment change to
    write-off a trade name intangible asset of $1.0 million in
    the Technical Products Group.

The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value
    of the trade name with its carrying value. Fair value is
    measured using the relief-from-royalty method which would be a
    “Level 3” measurement under the fair value
    hierarchy described in Note 1. This method assumes the
    trade name has value to the extent that their owner is relieved
    of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received
    from them. This method requires us to estimate the future
    revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and
    the weighted average cost of capital. The impairment charge was
    the result of significant declines in sales volume. These
    charges were recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

    intangible assets during the next five years is as follows:

We have a multi-currency revolving Credit Facility (“Credit
    Facility”). The Credit Facility creates an unsecured,
    committed revolving credit facility of up to $800 million,
    with multi-currency sub facilities to support investments
    outside the U.S. The Credit Facility expires on
    June 4, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will
    bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest rates
    and fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. Our
    use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the
    relative interest rates for our paper compared to the cost of
    borrowing under our Credit Facility. As of December 31,
    2009, we had no outstanding commercial paper. As of
    December 31, 2008 we had $0.2 million of commercial
    paper outstanding.

All of the commercial paper and $133.9 million aggregate
    principle 7.85% Senior Notes due 2009 (the
    “Notes”) at December 31, 2008 were classified as
    long-term as we had the intent and the ability to refinance such
    obligations on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $40.0 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had $2.1 of
    borrowings as of December 31, 2009.

Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the
    most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total
    consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated EBITDA,
    as defined) that may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. We were in
    compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements
    as of December 31, 2009.

Total availability under our existing Credit Facility was
    $601.7 million at December 31, 2009, which would be
    limited to $390.2 million based on the credit
    agreement’s leverage ratio covenant.

On July 8, 2008, we commenced a cash tender offer for all
    of our outstanding Notes. Upon expiration of the tender offer on
    August 4, 2008, we purchased $116.1 million aggregate
    principal amount of the Notes. As a result of this transaction,
    we recognized a loss of $4.6 million on early
    extinguishment of debt in 2008. The loss included the write off
    of $0.1 million in unamortized deferred financing fees and
    $0.6 million in previously unrecognized swap gains, and
    cash paid of $5.1 million related to the tender premium and
    other costs associated with the purchase.

On March 16, 2009, we announced the redemption of all of
    our remaining outstanding $133.9 million aggregate
    principal of Notes. The Notes were redeemed on April 15,
    2009 at a redemption price of $1,035.88 per $1,000 of principal
    outstanding plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of this
    transaction, we recognized a loss of $4.8 million on early
    extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2009. The loss
    included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized
    deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of
    $0.3 million in previously unrecognized swap gains, and
    cash paid of $5.0 million related to the redemption and
    other costs associated with the purchase.

Derivative

Cash-flow

In August 2007, we entered into a $105 million interest
    rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for a fixed
    rate obligation without the exchange of the underlying principal
    amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. The
    effective date of the swap was August 30, 2007. The swap
    agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.89% and expires in May
    2012. The fixed interest rate of 4.89% plus the .50% interest
    rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective fixed interest
    rate of 5.39%. The fair value of the swap was a liability of
    $8.1 million and $10.7 million at December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively, and was recorded
    in

Other non-current liabilities

.

In September 2005, we entered into a $100 million interest
    rate swap agreement with several major financial institutions to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for fixed
    rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying
    principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures.
    The effective date of the fixed rate swap was April 25,
    2006. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.68% and
    expires in July 2013. The fixed interest rate of 4.68% plus the
    .60% interest rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective
    fixed interest rate of 5.28%. The fair value of the swap was a
    liability of $8.3 million and $11.6 million at
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively,
    and was recorded in

Other non-current liabilities

.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as
    cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps are recorded as
    assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
    Unrealized income/expense is included in Accumulated other
    comprehensive income (“OCI”) and realized
    income/expense, amounts due to/from swap

counterparties, are included in earnings. We realized
    incremental interest expense resulting from the swaps of
    $7.9 million and $3.4 million at December 31,
    2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as and
    are effective as cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps
    are recorded as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, with changes in their fair value included in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

(“OCI”).
    Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified
    into earnings at the time the related interest expense is
    recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs.

Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result
    in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement. In this
    case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable
    interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are
    at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for
    $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus .60% for
    $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all
    of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to
    continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if
    we continue to be in a net pay position.

At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our interest rate swaps are
    carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis. Fair values
    are determined through the use of models that consider various
    assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as
    other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are
    classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined by
    the accounting guidance.

•

short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents,

    variable rate debt) — recorded amount approximates
    fair value because of the short maturity period;

•

long-term fixed rate debt, including current
    maturities — fair value is based on market quotes
    available for issuance of debt with similar terms, which are
    inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation
    hierarchy defined by the accounting guidance; and

•

interest rate swap agreements — fair values are

    (continued)

Included in the $30.0 million of total gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2009 was $26.8 million
    of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective
    tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2009 may decrease by a
    range of $0 to $22.8 million during the next twelve months
    primarily as a result of the resolution of federal, state and
    foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of
    limitations.

The determination of annual income tax expense takes into
    consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for
    open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    has examined our U.S. federal income tax returns through
    2003 with no material adjustments. The IRS has also completed a
    survey of our 2004 U.S. federal income tax return with no
    material findings. The IRS is currently examining our 2005 and
    2006 federal tax returns. No material adjustments have been
    proposed; however, actual settlements may differ from amounts
    accrued.

We record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in

Provision for income taxes

and

Net
    interest expense

, respectively, which is consistent with our
    past practices. As of December 31, 2009, we had recorded
    approximately $0.6 million for the possible payment of
    penalties and $5.5 million related to the possible payment
    of interest.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our
    intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to
    repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.
    As of December 31, 2009, approximately $173.0 million
    of unremitted earnings attributable to international
    subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely invested. It is
    not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be
    payable if such earnings were to be remitted.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of
    these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets”
    (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
    in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities”
    (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the
    tax impact has not yet been recorded in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income).

Included in Other, net in the table above are deferred tax
    assets of $4.7 million and $8.1 million as of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively,
    related to a foreign tax credit carryover from the tax period
    ended December 31, 2006 and related to state net operating
    losses. The foreign tax credit is eligible for carryforward
    until the tax period ending December 31, 2016.

Non-U.S. tax

losses of $49.1 million and $19.8 million were
    available for carryforward at December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively. A valuation allowance reflected above in other,
    net of $7.5 million and $3.3 million exists for
    deferred income tax benefits related to the

non-U.S. loss

carryforwards available as of December 31, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively that may not be realized. We believe that
    sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective
    countries to allow us to fully recover the remainder of the tax
    losses. The

non-U.S. operating

losses are subject to varying expiration periods and will begin
    to expire in 2010. State tax losses of $73.0 million and
    $73.0 million were available for carryforward at
    December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. A valuation
    allowance reflected above in other, net of $2.6 million and
    $2.0 million exists for deferred income tax benefits
    related to the carryforwards available at December 31, 2009
    and December 31, 2008, respectively. Certain state tax
    losses will expire in 2010, while others are subject to
    carryforward periods of up to twenty years.

Benefit
    Plans

Pension
    and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based
    principally on an employee’s years of service

and/or

compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also
    provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance
    benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life
    insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a
    December 31 measurement date each year.

We recognized a pension curtailment gain in December 2007, of
    $5.5 million related to the announcement that we will be
    freezing certain pension plans as of December 31, 2017.
    Also, we recognized a curtailment gain of $4.1 million
    related to the termination of certain post-retirement health
    care benefits.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments
    from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our
    U.S. plans of 6.00% in 2009, 6.50% in 2008 and 2007. The
    discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 2.00% to 6.00%
    in 2009, 2.00% to 6.25% in 2008 and 2.00% to 5.25% in 2007.
    There are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount
    rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2009.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2009 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2008 and 2007. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices. In 2009, the pension plan assets
    yielded returns of 19.5%, compared to a loss of 28.8% in 2008
    and returns of 7.8% in 2007.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains
    or losses for this purpose are the difference between the
    expected return calculated using the market-related value of
    assets and the actual return based on the market-related value
    of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes
    gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Unrecognized
    pension and post-retirement losses

As of our December 31, 2009 measurement date, our plans
    have $96.6 million of cumulative unrecognized losses. To
    the extent the unrecognized losses, when adjusted for the
    difference between market and market related values of assets,
    exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, it will be
    amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over
    the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active
    participants (currently approximating 12 years).

The assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31 are as
    follows:



Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year

The assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant

Objective

The primary objective of our investment strategy is to meet the
    pension obligation to our employees at a reasonable cost to the
    company. This is primarily accomplished through growth of
    capital and safety of the funds invested. The plans will
    therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital
    over inflation through appreciation of securities held and
    through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and
    interest income.

Asset
    allocation

Our actual overall asset allocation for the plans as compared to
    our investment policy goals is as follows:

Alternative Investments

Cash

While the target allocations do not have a percentage allocated
    to cash, the plan assets will always include some cash due to
    cash flow. In 2009, as a result of our year end decision to make
    a $25 million discretionary pension plan contribution, a
    higher percentage of assets were held in cash equivalents. This
    contribution was



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

directed to be invested in fixed income investments and was
    invested shortly after year end. After taking this into
    consideration, our fixed income investment percentage would have
    been 30% and our cash percentage would have been 3%.

As part of our strategy to reduce U.S. pension plan funded
    status volatility, we plan to increase the allocation to long
    duration fixed income securities in future years as the funded
    status of our U.S. pension plans improve. In 2009 we
    increased our fixed income investments from 10% to 30%.

Valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair
    value are as follows:

•

Cash Equivalents:

Consist of
    investments in commingled funds valued based on observable
    market data. Such investments are classified as Level 2.

•

Fixed Income:

Investments in corporate
    bonds, government securities, mortgages and asset backed
    securities are value based upon quoted market prices for
    identical or similar securities and other observable market
    data. Investments in commingled funds are generally valued at
    the net asset value of units held at the end of the period based
    upon the value of the underlying investments as determined by
    quoted market prices or by a pricing service. Such investments
    are classified as Level 2. Certain investments in
    commingled funds are valued based on unobservable inputs due to
    liquidation restrictions. These investments are classified as
    Level 3.

•

Global Equity Securities:

Equity
    securities and Pentair common stock are valued based on the
    closing market price in an active market and are classified as
    Level 1. Investments in commingled funds are valued at the
    net asset value of units held at the end of the period based
    upon the value of the underlying investments as determined by
    quoted market prices or by a pricing service. Such investments
    are classified as Level 2.

•

Other Investments:

Other investments
    include investments in commingled funds with diversified
    investment strategies. Investments in commingled funds that are
    valued at the net asset value of units held at the end of the
    period based upon the value of the underlying investments as
    determined by quoted market prices or by a pricing service are
    classified as Level 2. Investments in commingled funds that
    are valued based on unobservable inputs due to liquidation
    restrictions are classified as Level 3.

Contributions

Pension contributions totaled $49.0 million and
    $12.8 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our 2010
    required pension contributions are expected to be in the range
    of $10 million to $15 million. The decrease in the
    2010 expected contribution is primarily a result of the December
    2009 discretionary contribution of $25 million to our
    defined benefit pension plan. The 2010 expected contributions
    will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements.

Savings
    plan

We have a 401(k) plan (“the plan”) with an employee
    stock ownership (“ESOP”) bonus component, which covers
    certain union and nearly all non-union U.S. employees who
    meet certain age requirements. Under the plan, eligible
    U.S. employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of
    their eligible compensation. The company matches contributions
    made by employees who meet certain eligibility and service
    requirements. Our matching contribution is 100% of eligible
    employee contributions for the first 1% of eligible
    compensation, and 50% of the next 5% of eligible compensation.
    In June 2009, we temporarily suspended the company match of the
    plan and ESOP.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet
    certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP
    contribution equal to 1.5% of annual eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the plan and ESOP was approximately
    $6.7 million, $17.0 million, and $11.9 million,
    in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively.

Other
    retirement compensation

Total other accrued retirement compensation was
    $17.3 million and $13.6 million in 2009 and 2008,
    respectively, and is included in the pension and other
    retirement compensation line of our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Authorized
    shares

We may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our
    Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those
    shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board
    of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock with
    authorization to issue up to 2.5 million shares,
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
    $0.10 per share. No shares of preferred stock were issued or
    outstanding as of December 31, 2009 or December 31,
    2008.

Purchase
    rights

On December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock.
    The dividend was payable upon the close of business on
    January 28, 2005 to the shareholders of record upon the
    close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right entitles
    the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share
    of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a
    price of $240.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless
    certain change in control events occur, such as a person
    acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership
    of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. The description
    and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement,
    dated December 10, 2004. The Rights will expire on
    January 28, 2015, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or
    exchanged in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement.
    On January 28, 2005, the common share purchase rights
    issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated July 31, 1995
    were redeemed in their entirety for an amount equal to $0.0025
    per right.

Share
    repurchases

In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a
    maximum dollar limit of $50 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had purchased 1,549,893 shares
    for $50.0 million pursuant to this authorization. This
    authorization expired on December 31, 2008. There were no
    share repurchase authorizations for 2009.

Stock
    Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense in 2009, 2008, and 2007
    was $17.3 million, $20.6 million, and
    $22.9 million, respectively.

Omnibus
    stock incentive plans

In May 2008, the 2008 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended
    and Restated (the “2008 Plan” or the “Plan”)
    was approved by shareholders. The 2008 Plan authorizes the
    issuance of additional shares of our common stock and extends
    through February 2018. The 2008 Plan allows for the granting of:

•

nonqualified stock options;

•

incentive stock options;

•

restricted shares;

•

restricted stock units;

•

dividend equivalent units;

•

stock appreciation rights;

•

performance shares;

•

performance units; and

•

other stock based awards.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee (the
    “Committee”), which is made up of independent members
    of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards
    under the Plans are managerial, administrative, or other key
    employees who are in a position to make a material contribution
    to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of
    Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the
    recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards,
    establish certain terms and conditions of award grants, and take
    certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan
    restricts the Committee’s authority to reprice awards or to
    cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

The Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders in
    2004 (the “2004 Plan”) expired upon approval of the
    2008 Plan by shareholders. Prior grants made under the 2004 Plan
    and earlier stock incentive plans remained outstanding on the
    terms in effect at the time of grant.

Non-qualified
    and incentive stock options

Under the Plan, we may grant stock options to any eligible
    employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally
    vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and
    expire ten years after the grant date. Prior to 2006, option
    grants typically had a reload feature when shares are retired to
    pay the exercise price, allowing individuals to receive
    additional options upon exercise equal to the number of shares
    retired. Option awards granted after 2005 under the 2004 Plan
    and under the 2008 Plan do not have a reload feature attached to
    the option. Annual expense for the value of stock options was
    $7.1 million in 2009, $10.5 million in 2008 and
    $13.6 million in 2007.

Restricted
    shares and restricted stock units

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded restricted shares
    or restricted stock units (awards) of our common stock. Share
    awards generally vest from two to five years after issuance,
    subject to continuous employment and certain other conditions.
    Restricted share awards are valued at market value on the date
    of grant and are expensed over the vesting period. Annual
    expense for the value of restricted shares and restricted stock
    units was $10.2 million in 2009, $10.1 million in
    2008, and $9.3 million in 2007.

Stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares, and performance
    units

Under the Plan, the Committee is permitted to issue these
    awards; however, there have been no issuances of these awards.

Outside
    directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options were granted to outside directors
    under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the
    “Directors Plan”) with an exercise price equal to the
    market value of the shares on the option grant dates. Options
    generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant
    date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors
    Plan expired in January 2008. Prior grants remain outstanding on
    the terms in effect at the time of grant.

Non-employee Directors are also eligible to receive awards under
    the 2008 Plan. Director awards are made by our Governance
    Committee, which is made up of independent members of our Board
    of Directors.

Business
    Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following
    business segments based primarily on types of products offered
    and markets served:

•

Water

— manufactures and markets
    essential products and systems used in the movement, storage,
    treatment, and enjoyment of water. Water segment products
    include water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification
    components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and
    pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Technical Products

— designs,
    manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom
    enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and
    electrical components and protect the people that use them.
    Applications served include industrial machinery, data
    communications, networking, telecommunications, test and
    measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general
    electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures,
    cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal
    management systems.

•

Other

— is primarily composed of
    unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance
    subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations,
    and intercompany eliminations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and
    operating income of the segments and use a variety of ratios to
    measure performance. These results are not necessarily
    indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred
    had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during
    the periods presented.

Net sales are based on the location in which the sale

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple
    markets and customers for which we do not have the information
    systems to track revenues by primary product category. However,
    our net sales by segment are representative of our sales by
    major product category.

We sell our products through various distribution channels
    including wholesale and retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. In our Water segment, no single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in 2009,
    one customer accounted for just over 10% of segment sales in
    2008 and one customer accounted for just over 11% of segment
    sales in 2007. In our Technical Products segment, no single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in 2009,
    2008, or 2007.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in the past and in certain cases, such as
    the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated
    paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge
    Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition of Lincoln
    Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools Group in
    2004, we have retained responsibility and potential liability
    for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims
    for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have
    established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
    potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.
    We settled some of the claims in prior years; to date our
    recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2009
    and 2008, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $2.3 million and
    $3.1 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

We record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss
    contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can
    be reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims could change in the future.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these
    claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For
    all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on
    an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated based on existing information. The accruals are
    adjusted periodically as additional information becomes
    available. We have not experienced significant unfavorable
    trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability
    lawsuits or personal injury claims.

Horizon
    Litigation

The Horizon litigation against our subsidiary Essef Corporation
    and certain of its subsidiaries by Celebrity Cruise Lines, Inc.
    (“Celebrity”) was settled by payment of
    $35 million to Celebrity in August 2008, a portion of which
    was covered by insurance. As a result of the settlement, we
    recorded a charge of $20.4 million in 2008 which is shown
    on the line

Legal settlement

in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Warranties
    and guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product
    lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various
    potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as
    pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or
    other obligations. The subject matter, amounts, and duration of
    any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of
    liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to
    transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such
    indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the
    overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably
    estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments
    for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur
    a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a
    material effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

We recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for
    the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
    guarantee.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products.
    Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a
    review of historical warranty and service claim experience.
    Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical
    experience warrant.

    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties
    under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, the
    outstanding value of these instruments totaled
    $51.2 million and $64.5 million, respectively.
