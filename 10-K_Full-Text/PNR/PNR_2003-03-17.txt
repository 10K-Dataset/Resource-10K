Ÿ

Achieve 5% annual productivity improvement on core business cost



RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Growth of our business

We continually look at each of our businesses to determine whether they fit with our evolving strategic vision. Our primary focus is on businesses with
strong fundamentals and growth opportunities. We seek growth both through product and service innovation, market expansion, and acquisitions. Acquisitions have played an important part in the growth of our business over the past five years.

Acquisitions

On September 30, 2002, we acquired 100 percent of the common stock of Plymouth Products, Inc. and affiliated entities (Plymouth Products) from USF
Consumer & Commercial WaterGroup, a unit of Vivendi Environnement, for $120.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus debt assumed of approximately $1.1 million. Plymouth Products is a manufacturer of water filtration products used in
residential, commercial, and industrial applications and had sales in 2001 in excess of $80.0 million.

On October 1, 2002, we acquired 100 percent of the common stock of privately held Oldham Saw Co., Inc. and affiliated entities (Oldham Saw) for $49.9 million cash, net of cash acquired plus debt
assumed of approximately $1.5 million. Oldham Saw designs, manufactures, and markets router bits, circular saw blades, and related accessories for the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional power tool markets and had net sales in the last 12 months
of approximately $59.0 million.

These acquisitions were financed
through available lines of credit.

Also refer to ITEM 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Discontinued operations/divestitures

In December 2000, we adopted a plan to sell our Equipment segment businesses, Service Equipment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) and Lincoln Industrial, Inc. (Lincoln Industrial). In October 2001, we completed the sale
of the Service Equipment businesses to Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of $18.2 million. In December 2001, we completed the sale of Lincoln Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan), other investors, and members of
management of Lincoln Industrial for total consideration of $78.4 million, including a preferred stock interest. The selling price of Lincoln Industrial was subject to a final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in January 2003, in which we
paid Jordan $2.4 million.

Also refer to ITEM 7,
Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We classify our continuing operations into the following business segments:

Ÿ

Tools

— manufactures and markets power tool products positioned at the mid- to upper-end of the market and targets non-professional DIY, upscale
hobbyists, and professional end users. Tools segment products include woodworking machinery, portable power tools, power tool accessories, metal and stoneworking tools, pneumatic tools, compressors, generators, and pressure washers.

Ÿ

Water

— manufactures and markets essential products for the transport, storage, and treatment of water and wastewater. Water segment products
include water and wastewater pumps, control valves, pumps and pumping stations, storage tanks, filtration cartridges and systems, and pool and spa equipment and accessories.

Ÿ

Enclosures

— designs, manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components.
Markets served include industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general



electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal management
systems.

Ÿ

Other

— is primarily composed of unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested
operations, and intercompany eliminations.

Business segment and geographical financial information is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

TOOLS SEGMENT

Strategy

Our Tools segment
strategies are to:

Ÿ

Reduce our overall cost structure by:

Ÿ

implementing PIMS enterprise practices;

Ÿ

utilizing low-cost manufacturing facilities; and

Ÿ

capturing supply management opportunities.

Ÿ

Leverage brands by:

Ÿ

accelerating innovation;

Ÿ

reducing product development cycle time; and

Ÿ

instituting targeted reseller and user marketing programs.

Ÿ

Reinforce our multi-channel strategy by targeting under-penetrated channels.

Ÿ

Drive accessories growth.

Ÿ

Grow our service business.

Ÿ

Pursue international markets.

Seasonality

We experience
strong seasonal demand for our pressure washer product line in the March through August time period. Demand for woodworking machinery, portable power tools, accessories, and compressors are strongest during spring and fall promotional events. As a
result, we typically experience stronger sales in the second and fourth quarters and weaker sales in the first and third quarters. This seasonality also drives higher inventories and accounts receivable levels in the second and third quarters of
each year.

Competition

The Tools segment faces numerous competitors and strong distributors, many of which are larger and have more resources. Competition in the Tools segment
has been intense and continues to increase, especially as these industries consolidate. In most markets, only a few large players remain, each having extensive product lines. We anticipate growth to come from product development, continued
penetration of expanding market channels, and acquisitions, especially in the accessories arena.

Competition at the end-user level focuses primarily on brand names, product performance and features, quality, service, and price. The competition for shelf space at home centers and national retailers
is particularly intense, demanding continuing product innovation, special inventory and delivery programs, and competitive pricing. Our strategy is to be the price/quality leader in our selected markets. We believe our success in maintaining our
position in the marketplace is primarily due to strong brands, developing product feature innovations, new products, promotions, and productivity gains.

Customer concentration

Information regarding significant customers in our Tools segment is contained in ITEM 8, Note 1 and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.



WATER SEGMENT

Strategy

Our Water segment strategies are to:

Ÿ

Accelerate innovation by:

Ÿ

developing breakthrough products;

Ÿ

reducing product development cycle times; and

Ÿ

pursuing system and service business opportunities.

Ÿ

Grow the business through:

Ÿ

expanding our business beyond the U.S., especially in the Asia/Pacific regions; and

Ÿ

acquisitions to fill product lines and expand applications.

Ÿ

Improve profitability via operational excellence by:

Ÿ

honing customer and product profitability;

Ÿ

reducing overhead costs;

Ÿ

improving product rationalization and sourcing;

Ÿ

implementing PIMS throughout the organization; and

Ÿ

capturing supply management opportunities.

Ÿ

Minimize inventory requirements.

Seasonality

We experience
strong seasonal demand in our Water segment for pool and spa equipment products in the March through July time period, with some advance sales occurring in earlier months, which generally include extended payment terms. As the installed base grows
throughout North America and Europe, the selling season tends to lengthen.

Competition

Our Water segment faces numerous competitors, some of which are larger, and have more resources.
Competition in the commercial and residential pump markets focuses on brand names, product performance, quality, and price. While home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps, they are much
less important in commercial pump markets. In municipal pump markets, competition focuses on performance to required specification, service, and price. Competition in the water treatment and filtration component markets focuses on product
performance and design, quality, delivery, and price. In the pool and spa equipment market, there are a number of competitors, only a few of which have as broad of a product line as ours. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and
high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We believe our existing distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market penetration.

Customer concentration

Information regarding significant customers in our Water segment is contained in ITEM 8, Note 1 and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

ENCLOSURES SEGMENT

Strategy

Our Enclosures segment strategies are to:

Ÿ

Lower our manufacturing cost by:

Ÿ

shifting manufacturing to low labor cost areas;

Ÿ

implementing PIMS enterprise practices; and

Ÿ

driving operational excellence.



Ÿ

Decrease our current cost structure by:

Ÿ

continued infrastructure reductions; and

Ÿ

product offering transformation.

Ÿ

Increase sales volume by:

Ÿ

focusing on growing market segments;

Ÿ

pursuing strategic OEMs;

Ÿ

leveraging our distribution channels; and

Ÿ

globalization.

Competition

Competition in the enclosures markets can be intense, particularly
in telecom and datacom markets, where product design, prototyping, global supply, and customer service are significant factors. The overall global decline in market demand over the last two years has created excess capacity throughout the industry.
Despite the retrenchment of virtually all participants in these markets, the need to generate fixed-cost absorption in this period of weakened demand has caused increased price competition in many markets. In 2002, our Enclosures segment focused on
cost control during a period of flat demand, which improved profitability on a sequential quarter to quarter basis, while many competitors faced financial constraints and even bankruptcy stemming from significant volume declines. Future growth in
the Enclosures segment will likely come from continued channel penetration, growth in targeted market segments, new product development, and geographic expansion. Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are visible trends in the enclosures
marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier. We believe our Enclosures business has the broadest array of products available, as well as the capability to deploy them globally.

INFORMATION REGARDING ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Backlog

Our backlog of orders from continuing operations as of December 31 by segment was:

The $2.4 million
increase in Tools segment backlog was primarily due to the 2002 acquisition of Oldham Saw and the timing of orders. The $4.1 million increase in Water segment backlog was primarily due to the 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products. The $17.1 million
decline in Enclosures segment backlog reflects the downturn in the datacom and telecom markets and the change in customer order patterns reverting from placing large program orders (necessary during a market upswing to ensure position in the build
schedule) back to placing smaller orders with shorter lead times. We expect that our backlog at December 31, 2002 will be filled in 2003.

Research and development

Research and development costs during 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $36.9 million, $31.2 million, and $31.2 million, respectively.

Environmental

Matters
pertaining to the environment are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7, and in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.



Raw materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel, plastic, electronic components, and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the
purchase of raw materials, some finished goods are purchased for distribution through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market, and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not experienced
any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be
terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist, and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse
effect on operations.

In our Tools segment, we have invested
approximately $25 million to acquire a 40 percent interest in certain joint venture operations of a long-time Asian tool supplier, which supplies us with a large portion of our bench top power tools. See also ITEM 8, Note 6 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Certain commodities, such as steel, are subject to a degree of market and duty-driven price fluctuations. These fluctuations are managed through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with escalator / de-escalator
clauses.

Intellectual property

Patents, trademarks, and proprietary technology are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon
any single patent, trademark, or technology.

Employees

At the end of 2002, we employed approximately 11,900 people worldwide. Total employees in the United States were approximately
9,300, of which approximately 850 were represented by trade unions having collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be very good.

Available information

We
maintain a website with the address www.pentair.com. We are not including the information contained on our website as a part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We make available free of charge (other than an
investor’s own Internet access charges) through our website our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q, and Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish such material to, the Securities and Exchange Commission.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our corporate office is located in St. Paul, Minnesota. Manufacturing operations are carried out at approximately 20 plants located throughout the United States and at 14 plants located in 11 other countries. Through a 40
percent-owned joint venture with a long-time Asian tool supplier, we have an interest in four additional factories in Asia. We also own or lease six other facilities that have been closed, of which five are located in the United States and one in
Scotland. In addition, we have approximately 23 warehouse facilities and numerous sales and service offices throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental, safety and health,



patent infringement, and employment matters. We believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings and claims will not have a material
adverse effect on our financial position, liquidity, or future results of operations.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in
a small number of environmental cleanups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount
material to our financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, as
well as the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of
the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites, including one site in Los Angeles,
California. This was acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999 and relates to operations no longer carried out at that site. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites. We
do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2002, our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately $10 million. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements
will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Product liability claims

As of February 28, 2003, we are defendants in approximately 120 product liability lawsuits and have been notified of approximately 140 additional claims. We continue to have in place insurance coverage deemed adequate for
our needs. A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald Insurance Company (Penwald), a regulated insurance company wholly owned by Pentair. See discussion in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements – Insurance subsidiary. Accounting accruals covering the deductible portion of liability claims not covered by Penwald have been established and are reviewed on a regular basis. We have not experienced significant
unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability claims.

Horizon litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs, a class action,
and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise Lines, Inc. (Celebrity) were brought against Essef Corporation (Essef) and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition in August 1999. These lawsuits alleged exposure to Legionnaires bacteria by
passengers aboard the cruise ship M/V Horizon, a ship operated by Celebrity. The lawsuits included a class action brought on behalf of all passengers aboard the ship during the relevant time period, individual “opt-out” passenger suits,
and a suit by Celebrity. Celebrity alleges in its suit that it has sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the M/V Horizon while it was dry-docked.

The claims against Essef and its involved subsidiaries are based upon the allegation that Essef designed, manufactured, and marketed two sand swimming
pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the Horizon, and allegations that the spa and filters contained bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from December 1993 through July 1994.



Prior to our acquisition of
Essef, a settlement was reached in the class action. With regard to the individual “opt-out” passenger suits, the claims of one plaintiff were tried under a stipulation among all remaining parties providing that the liability findings
would be applicable to all plaintiffs and defendants. The claims of this plaintiff were unusual because he alleged that he developed complications that profoundly impaired his mental functioning. No other plaintiff asserted similar claims.

The trial resulted in a jury verdict on June 13, 2000 finding
liability on the part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister company, Fantasia (together 30%). Compensatory damages in the total amount of $2.7 million were awarded, each defendant being accountable for its proportionate share of
liability. The Essef defendants’ proportionate share is covered by insurance. Punitive damages were separately awarded against the Essef defendants in the total amount of $7 million, with 60% awarded to all remaining plaintiffs and 40% to
Celebrity. The Essef defendant filed post-trial motions challenging the verdict which were denied in February 2002 and has subsequently filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeal for the Second Circuit.

All of the remaining individual cases have been resolved through either
settlement or trial. The only remaining unresolved case is that brought by Celebrity for interruption of its business. That case has been placed on hold pending a resolution of post-trial motions.

At the current time, we are optimistic that remaining suits will be resolved
within available insurance coverage. With regard to Celebrity’s claim against Essef, Westchester, one of Essef’s insurance carriers, has issued a notice of rights letter. We believe we have reserves sufficient to cover the amount of any
uninsured awards or settlements.

ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA



ITEM
6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA – (continued)

(1)

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This new standard requires that goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have an indefinite life no longer be amortized. This standard did not require restatement of prior period amounts to be consistent with the current year presentation and therefore we have not made any adjustments to the historical
financial information presented. However, we have provided supplemental tax and diluted EPS information as we believe it is necessary to the understanding of our financial performance trend.

(2)

Calculated using a 13-month moving average.

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted EITF Issue No. 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the

Vendor’s

Products.

This new standard requires that certain payments to our customers for cooperative advertising and certain sales incentive offers that were historically classified in selling, general and administrative expense be
reclassified and shown as a reduction in net sales. We have restated historical financial information as required by this new standard.

In 2001, we discontinued our Equipment segment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive and Lincoln Industrial businesses). Historical financial information
has been adjusted to reflect this change. The 2001 results reflect a pre-tax loss on the sale of these businesses of $36.3 million ($24.6 million after tax, or $0.50 per share).

Cost of goods sold in 2001 includes $1 million related to the 2001 restructuring charge for our Enclosures segment.

The 2000 results reflect a non-cash pre-tax cumulative effect of
accounting change related to revenue recognition that reduced income by $1.9 million ($1.2 million after tax, or $0.02 per share).

The 1997 results include a pre-tax gain on the sale of Federal Cartridge of $10.3 million ($1.2 million after tax, or $0.03 per share).

Reference should be made to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This report contains statements that we believe to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,” “will,”
“expected,” “intend,” “estimate,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “project,” or “continue,” or the negative thereof or similar words. From time to time, we also may provide oral or
written forward-looking statements in other materials we release to the public. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this report and in any public statements we make could be materially different from actual results. They can be affected
by assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks or uncertainties. Consequently, we cannot guarantee any forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Investors should
also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties.

The following factors may impact the achievement of forward-looking
statements:

•

changes in industry conditions, such as:

•

the strength of product demand;

•

the intensity of competition;

•

pricing pressures;

•

market acceptance of new product introductions;

•

the introduction of new products by competitors;

•

our ability to maintain and expand relationships with large retail stores;

•

our ability to source components from third parties, in particular foreign manufacturers, without interruption and at reasonable prices; and

•

the financial condition of our customers.

•

changes in our business strategies, including acquisition, divestiture, and restructuring activities;

•

governmental and regulatory policies;

•

general economic and political conditions, such as political instability, the rate of economic growth in our principal geographic or product markets, or fluctuations
in exchange rates;

•

changes in operating factors, such as continued improvement in manufacturing activities and the achievement of related efficiencies, cost reductions, and inventory
risks due to shifts in market demand;

•

our ability to successfully identify, complete, and integrate future acquisitions; and

•

our ability to accurately evaluate the effects of contingent liabilities such as taxes, product liability, environmental, and other claims.

The foregoing factors are not exhaustive, and new
factors may emerge or changes to the foregoing factors may occur that would impact our business. We assume no obligation, and disclaim any duty, to update the forward-looking statements in this report.

GENERAL

We are a diversified industrial manufacturer operating in three segments: Tools, Water, and Enclosures. Our Tools segment
manufactures and markets a wide range of power tools under several brand names generating approximately 40 percent of total revenues. Our Water segment manufactures and markets essential products for



the transport, storage, and treatment of water and wastewater and generates approximately 35 percent of total revenues. Our Enclosures
segment accounts for approximately 25 percent of total revenues, and designs, manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components for markets that include industrial machinery, data
communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics.

In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we make reference to certain non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures,
including gross profit, operating income, selling, general and administrative (SG&A), income from continuing operations before income taxes, and provision for income taxes, in each case “excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring
charges” or “excluding restructuring charge.” We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide investors with another measure to consider, in conjunction with the GAAP results, that may be
helpful to meaningfully compare our operating performance between periods. We also use these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing our own operating performance. A description of the accounting standards applicable to the elimination of the
amortization of goodwill is included below under “New Accounting Standards.” A description of the restructuring charges that we exclude from GAAP results is included below under “Results of Operations – Restructuring
Charges.” In each case below when we make reference to a non-GAAP financial measure, we also provide a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net sales

The components of
the net sales change were:

Net sales in 2002
totaled $2,581 million, compared with $2,574 million in 2001, and $2,706 million in 2000. In 2002, volume increased by approximately 0.2 percent primarily due to increased demand and acquisitions in both our Tools and Water segments. These increases
were mostly offset by the continued weak demand for our Enclosures segment products. Price declined by approximately 0.3 percent primarily due to the introduction of lower price point products and promotional discounting for our Tools segment
products. In addition, the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2002 favorably impacted the dollar value of sales by about 0.4 percent. The 4.9 percent or $132 million decline in net sales in 2001 compared to 2000 reflected volume declines in
each of our businesses resulting from a weak global economy and a stronger U.S. dollar, which reduced the dollar value of foreign sales by about 0.5 percent.

Sales by segment and the year-over-year changes were as follows:



Tools

The 9.1 percent increase in Tools segment sales in 2002 was primarily due to:

•

higher sales volume in our DeVilbiss Air Power Company (DAPC) business, particularly for pressure washers;

•

higher sales volume in our Delta business as a result of our new sub-branding strategy through the creation of Delta Shopmaster

™

and Delta Industrial

™

brands. The Delta Shopmaster

™

brand is targeted toward the entry-level do-it-yourselfer and
the Delta Industrial

™

brand is targeted toward the professional craftsman; and

•

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Oldham Saw Co., Inc. (Oldham Saw).

These increases were partially offset by:

•

declines in average selling prices due to the introduction of lower price point products for the Delta Shopmaster

™

brand and heavy second-half 2002 promotional discounting in a more competitive marketplace.

The 2.7 percent decline in Tools segment sales in 2001 was primarily due
to:

•

lower sales volume due to the weak economy, and lower average selling prices stemming from the mid-2000 price discounting activities.

Water

The 5.6 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2002 was primarily due to:

•

higher pump sales, with most of the growth coming from the residential retail and municipal markets;

•

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products, Inc. (Plymouth Products); and

•

higher sales volume in our pool and spa equipment business.

The 1.7 percent decline in Water segment sales in 2001 was primarily due to:

•

lower sales volume for our industrial pumps and components for large water filtration systems as a weaker economy slowed demand, and unfavorable impacts of foreign
currency translation. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in our pool and spa equipment business as we increased market share.

Enclosures

The 19.4 percent decline in Enclosures segment sales in 2002 was primarily due to:

•

lower sales volume reflecting severely reduced capital spending in the industrial market and over-capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets,
partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects.

The 11.3 percent decline in Enclosures segment sales in 2001 was primarily due to:

•

lower sales volume attributable to sharp declines in all enclosures markets and unfavorable impacts of foreign currency translation, somewhat offset by increased
sales due to the expansion in the number of Hoffman distributors.

Gross profit margin was 23.9 percent in 2002, compared with 23.5 percent in
2001 and 24.2 percent in 2000.



The 0.4 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily
the result of:

•

savings generated from our supply chain management and lean enterprise initiatives, as well as cost savings realized from restructuring programs;

•

volume increases in our Tools and Water segments; and

•

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisitions of Oldham Saw and Plymouth Products.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

volume declines in our Enclosures segment; and

•

unfavorable selling prices due to increased promotional discounting in our Tools segment.

The 0.7 percentage point decline in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2001 from 2000 was primarily the result of:

•

sharply lower sales volume and unfavorable product mix in our Enclosures segment, partially offset by improved gross margins in our Tools segment due to material
price savings and other cost reduction programs and the establishment of additional inventory valuation reserves in 2000 of $8 million.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)

The following table and discussion provides a comparison of SG&A expense as reported, and those results excluding goodwill amortization.

SG&A expense was
13.3 percent of sales or flat when compared with 2001. This was primarily the result of lower spending for process improvement investments in 2002, mostly offset by higher bad debt expense.

SG&A expense in 2001 was 13.2 percent of sales or essentially flat when
compared with 2000. However, SG&A expense in 2000 included $22 million to establish additional bad debt reserves. Excluding this amount, SG&A expense as a percent of sales in 2000 was 12.5 percent of sales. The 0.8 percentage point increase
in 2001 from 2000, excluding the $22 million reserve adjustment, was primarily the result of higher investments in 2001 to redefine and streamline company-wide business processes in the areas of supply chain management and lean enterprise. In
addition, Enclosures segment sales declined at a much faster rate than the decrease in their SG&A expense.

Tools and Water segments.



Restructuring charges

2000 Restructuring Charge

To reduce costs and improve productivity and accountability, we initiated a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2000 to decentralize corporate service functions and reorganize our Tools segment infrastructure. As a result,
we recorded a restructuring charge of $26.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a final change in estimate that reduced the restructuring charge by $1.7 million primarily due to favorable negotiation of contract termination costs. As
of the end of 2001, this restructuring program was complete.

2001 Restructuring Charge

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we initiated a restructuring program designed to consolidate
manufacturing operations and eliminate non-critical support facilities in our Enclosures segment. We also wrote off internal-use software development costs at corporate for the abandonment of a company-wide human resource system. Consequently, we
recorded a restructuring charge of $42.8 million, of which $1 million is included in

cost of goods sold

on the consolidated statement of income for the write-down of inventory on certain custom enclosures product that were discontinued as a
result of plant closures.

The major components of the 2000
and 2001 restructuring charges and remaining restructuring liability follows:

Included in

other
current liabilities

on the consolidated balance sheets is the unused portion of the restructuring charge liability of $3.6 million, primarily related to severance obligations not yet paid to certain terminated individuals and other charges as we
are awaiting the results of pending and threatened litigation proceedings, and therefore, are uncertain when this remaining liability will be paid. Funding of future payments will be paid from cash generated from operating activities.

As a result of our 2000 restructuring charge program, we reduced our workforce
by approximately 225 employees. Workforce reductions related to the 2001 restructuring charge are for approximately 884 employees, of whom 867 were terminated in 2001 and 2002. Employee termination benefits consist primarily of severance and
outplacement counseling fees. Employee termination benefits for the 2001 restructuring charge includes a $0.4 million non-cash charge for the intrinsic value of stock options modified as part of a severance agreement.

Non-cash asset disposals for the 2000 and 2001 restructuring charges were for
the write-down of equipment, leasehold improvements, and inventory (2001 only) as a direct result of our decisions to exit certain facilities and the abandonment of internal use software under development. Exit costs are primarily related to
contract and lease termination costs.



The following table
summarizes the components of the 2000 and 2001 restructuring charges by segment, net of changes in estimates:

Operating income

Tools

The following table and discussion provides a comparison of our Tools segment operating income as reported, and those results excluding goodwill
amortization and restructuring charge.

Percentages may
reflect rounding adjustments.

The 1.7 percentage point
increase in Tools segment 2002 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to:

•

higher sales volume in our DAPC and Delta businesses, partially offset by price declines due to promotional discounting;

•

cost savings as a result of our supply management and lean enterprise initiatives; and

•

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Oldham Saw.

The 3.5 percentage point increase in Tools segment 2001 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to:

•

additional inventory valuation and bad debt reserves established in 2000 of $30 million (2.9 percentage points), and cost savings from our supply chain management
and lean enterprise initiatives.

These
increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales volume due to the weak economy and selling prices stemming from mid-2000 price discounting activities, higher warranty costs, and unfavorable pension
costs due to lower returns on pension assets.



Water

The following table and discussion provides a comparison of our Water segment operating income as reported, and those results
excluding goodwill amortization.

Percentages may
reflect rounding adjustments.

The 0.9 percentage point
decline in Water segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2002 was primarily due to:

•

unfavorable product mix as a result of higher sales of lower margin residential retail pumps;

•

higher costs at certain pump and water treatment businesses; and

•

price declines, primarily related to large international water treatment projects for reverse osmosis housings.

The 1.0 percentage point decline in Water segment operating income in 2001
as a percent of net sales was primarily due to:

•

unfavorable product mix resulting from lower sales volume of certain high margin pump and water treatment products, which were more directly affected by the economic
slowdown. These decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in our pool and spa equipment business.

Enclosures

The following table
and discussion provides a comparison of our Enclosures segment operating income as reported, and those results excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges.

Percentages may
reflect rounding adjustments.

The 1.8 percentage point
decline in Enclosures segment 2002 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to:

•

lower sales volume due to continuing significant industry-wide sales declines, resulting in unabsorbed overhead despite reductions in overall cost structure,
partially offset by savings realized as a part of our restructuring program, net of one-time nonrecurring costs.

The 6.1 percentage point decline in Enclosures segment 2001 operating income as a percent of net sales was primarily due to:

•

lower sales volume, attributable to sharp declines in all enclosures markets, unfavorable product mix, and unfavorable pension costs due to lower returns on pension
assets. These decreases in 2001 were partially offset by lower costs, primarily due to headcount reductions.



Other expense

In 2001, we incurred a non-cash charge of $3.0 million primarily for the write-off of our business-to-business e-commerce equity
investment that we made in early 2000.

Net interest expense was
$43.5 million in 2002, compared with $61.5 million in 2001 and $74.9 million in 2000. The year-over-year declines in net interest expense reflects lower average borrowings driven by our strong cash flow performance in both 2002 and 2001, and lower
interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Provision for
income taxes

The following table and discussion provides a comparison of our provision for income taxes as reported, and those
results excluding goodwill amortization.

Our effective tax rate
on continuing operations excluding goodwill amortization was 32.5 percent in 2002, compared with 30.8 percent in 2001 and 30.1 percent in 2000. The 1.7 percentage point increase in 2002 from 2001 primarily reflects an increased percentage of
earnings taxed in countries with higher marginal rates. The 0.7 percentage point increase in 2001 from 2000 primarily reflects non-deductible amounts related to the 2001 restructuring charge.

We expect our effective tax rate on continuing operations to be 34 percent in
2003.

Discontinued operations/divestitures

In December 2000, we adopted a plan to sell our Equipment segment businesses, Service Equipment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive
Company) and Lincoln Industrial, Inc. (Lincoln Industrial). In October 2001, we completed the sale of the Service Equipment businesses to Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of $18.2 million. In December 2001, we completed the sale of
Lincoln Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan), other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial for total consideration of $78.4 million, including a preferred stock interest. The selling price of Lincoln
Industrial was subject to a final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in January 2003, in which we paid Jordan $2.4 million.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, and dividend payments are generally funded
from cash generated from operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities, and in certain instances, equity and public debt transactions.



The following table presents
selected working capital measurements calculated from our monthly operating results based on a 13-month moving average and indicates our emphasis on working capital management:

Operating
activities

Operating activities provided cash flow of $270.8 million in 2002, compared with $232.3 million in 2001, and $184.9
million in 2000. The $38.5 million increase in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due an increase in net income and better working capital management. The $47.4 million increase in 2001 from 2000 was primarily due to an emphasis on better management of
accounts receivable and inventories, somewhat offset by the decrease in accounts payable and the decline in net income.

Investing activities

Capital
expenditures in 2002, 2001, and 2000 were $56.7 million (including $23.0 million for the acquisition of a previously leased facility) or 2.2 percent of sales, $53.7 million or 2.1 percent of sales, and $68.0 million or 2.5 percent of sales,
respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures in 2003 to be approximately $45.0 primarily in the areas of new product development and general maintenance capital.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we acquired Plymouth Products and Oldham Saw for $170.3 million cash, net of cash acquired
plus debt assumed of $2.6 million. The acquisitions are subject to final purchase price adjustments.

We have invested approximately $24.9 million to acquire a 40 percent interest in certain joint venture operations of an Asian supplier for bench top tools, of which $20.4 million was paid for in the
year ended December 31, 2001 and an additional $4.5 million was paid in 2002. We hold options to increase our ownership interest in these joint ventures to 100 percent.

In the first quarter of 2001, we acquired Taunus, a Brazilian enclosures manufacturer, for $6.9 million. The acquisition was
financed through borrowings under our credit facilities. In the second quarter of 2001, we received $5.0 million for the settlement of a purchase price dispute related to a 1999 acquisition. The amount received was accounted for as a reduction of
goodwill.

We periodically review our array of businesses in
comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives. As part of this review, we may routinely acquire or divest certain businesses.

Financing activities

At
December 31, 2002, our capital structure consisted of $735.1 million in total indebtedness and $1,105.7 million in shareholders’ equity. The ratio of debt-to-total capital was 39.9 percent, compared with 41.6 percent at December 31,
2001. Our targeted debt-to-total capital ratio range is approximately 40 percent. We will exceed this target from time to time as needed for operational purposes and/or acquisitions.

The following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity:



Long-term debt and lines of
credit are explained in detail in ITEM 8, Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are explained in detail in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2002, we had $652 million in committed revolving credit
facilities (the Facilities) with various banks consisting of a $242 million 364-day facility that expires on August 28, 2003, and $410 million of multi-currency facilities, of which $20 million expires on August 8, 2004 and $390 million expires on
September 2, 2004. Interest rates and fees on the Facilities vary based on our credit ratings.

We believe we will be able to pay or refinance debt coming due in the near term through cash generated from operations combined with our ability to borrow as necessary in the financial markets.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

Rating Agency

Long-Term Debt Rating

Standard & Poor’s

BBB

Moody’s

Baa3

The weighted-average
interest rate for borrowings under the Facilities during 2002 and 2001 was 3.09 percent and 5.52 percent, respectively. Credit available under existing facilities, as limited by our most restrictive financial covenant, was approximately $227 million
and is based on a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). In addition, our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount we pay for dividends and require us to
maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2002.

In addition to the Facilities, we have $40.0 million of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had $0.7 million outstanding as of December 31,
2002.

In 2002, we issued financial stand-by letters of credit to
secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance programs, certain legal matters, and other commitments in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2002, we had stand-by letters of credit outstanding of $16.7 million.

Dividends paid in 2002 were $36.4 million, compared with $34.3
million in 2001, and $32.0 million in 2000. The year-over-year increases reflect an increase in our annual per-share dividend of $0.74 in 2002, compared with $0.70 in 2001, and $0.66 in 2000. We have paid dividends for the past 27 years and
anticipate paying future dividends.

We believe cash generated
from operating activities, together with credit available under committed and uncommitted facilities and our current cash position, will provide adequate short-term and long-term liquidity.

Other financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the consolidated
statements of cash flows, we also measure our free cash flow. We define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, including both continuing and discontinued operations. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial
measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds a 100 percent conversion of net income. We believe our ability to convert net income into free cash
flow gives us opportunities to invest in new growth initiatives to create shareholder value. In 2002, we generated free cash flow of $214.1 million, compared with $178.7 million in 2001, and $116.9 million in 2000.



Off-balance sheet
financing

At December 31, 2001, we were a party to a synthetic leasing arrangement for a distribution center and office building in
our Tools segment. The lease qualified as an operating lease for accounting purposes and the value of the underlying asset and related debt was off-balance sheet. In the fourth quarter of 2002, we terminated this off-balance sheet financing
arrangement and purchased the related facilities for $23 million. At December 31, 2002, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been
named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental cleanups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis

status. To date, none of these
claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the
disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, as well as the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain
environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of
retained responsibilities.

In addition, there are pending
environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites, including one site in Los Angeles, California. This was acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999 and relates to operations no longer carried out at that site. We have
established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When it has been possible
to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2002, our reserve for such
environmental liabilities was approximately $10 million. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount
of our current reserves.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Emerging Issues Task
Force (EITF) Issue No. 01-9,

Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products

. This new standard requires that certain payments to our customers for cooperative advertising and certain
sales incentive offers that were historically classified as selling, general and administrative expense be reclassified and shown as a reduction in net sales. EITF Issue No. 01-9 also requires the reclassification of previously reported results of
operations for periods prior to the adoption to conform to the current presentation. Accordingly, previously reported net sales for 2001 and 2000 were reduced by $41.9 million and $42.4 million (with an offsetting reduction in selling expense),
respectively. The adoption of this new standard had no impact on previously reported operating income, net income, or earnings per share.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
Intangible Assets

. This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life, the statement requires a
test for impairment to be performed annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002, and as a result, no longer record goodwill amortization. An
initial assessment of the recoverability of goodwill recorded on the date of adoption was completed in the second



quarter of 2002. Additionally, we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002. No impairment was present upon
performing either of the 2002 impairment tests. The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market comparable, and market capitalization approaches.

Had we accounted for goodwill under SFAS No. 142 for all prior
periods presented, our net income and earnings per share from continuing operations would have been as follows:

In June 2001, the FASB
issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

. This new standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement
costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees.
SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We will adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 and have determined that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In
October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. This standard supersedes SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
Of

; however, it retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement requirements of long-lived assets to be
disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations. It also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for
sale. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of FASB Statements
No. 4, 44 and 62, amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections

. This new standard will require gains and losses on the extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather than as
extraordinary items as previously required under SFAS No. 4. Extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 30. SFAS No. 145 also amends



SFAS No. 13 to require certain modifications to capital leases to be treated as a sale-leaseback and modifies the accounting for
sub-leases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor (or guarantor). SFAS No. 145 is effective for financial statements issued after May 15, 2002, and with respect to the impact of the reporting requirements of changes made to SFAS
No. 4, for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The adoption of these provisions did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Pentair will adopt the remaining provisions of SFAS No. 145 in 2003. We do
not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

. This new standard nullifies EITF
Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with
an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by SFAS No. 144, be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than the date of an entity’s commitment to an
exit plan. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. We will adopt SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. We do not expect that SFAS No. 146 will have a
material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition
for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim
financial statements about the method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Pentair will continue to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. As
such, we do not expect this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148 at December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

. Interpretation No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees. It also
clarifies that at the time an entity issues a guarantee, the issuing entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. However, the provisions related to recognizing a liability at
inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor’s obligations does not apply to product warranties, guarantees accounted for as derivatives, or other guarantees of an entity’s own future performance. We have adopted the
disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of December 31, 2002. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We have not yet determined the
effect of adopting the initial recognition and measurement provisions on Pentair’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE), an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

, which
requires all VIEs to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the VIE. In addition, the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both VIEs that
are consolidated as well as VIEs from which the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests, but not the majority. The disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued
after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have any effect on our consolidated financial position
or results of operations.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING
POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to
prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Certain
of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty.
These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical
if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the
following:

Impairment of Goodwill

In conjunction with the implementation of the new accounting rules for goodwill effective January 1, 2002, we performed our initial assessment test, and
also completed our annual impairment test of goodwill, and found no impairment. The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market comparable, and market
capitalization approaches. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. If these estimates change, we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets Including Cost and Equity Method
Investments

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when
events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group
from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between
estimated fair value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us to
estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

At the end of 2002, we have $53.8 million invested in certain privately held companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. We write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances
indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the investees’ financial condition, and in certain cases the possibility of subsequent rounds of financing,
as well as the investees’ historical results of operations, and projected results and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from projections, we may incur future charges for the impairment of these
investments.

Pension

During 2002, asset returns for our U.S. domestic defined benefit pension plans were adversely affected by continued deterioration in the equity markets.
In addition, interest rates have declined, which resulted in a decrease in the assumed discount rate used to measure these plans from 7.25 percent in 2001 to 6.25 percent in 2002. The lower asset returns and discount rates have unfavorably impacted
the 2002 year-end funded status and increased our pension expense and plan contributions.



The decrease in the discount
rate caused an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation, and the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair market value of plan assets at December 31, 2002. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid asset,
was the primary cause of a $29.2 million net-of-tax charge to shareholders’ equity for 2002. This charge did not impact 2002 earnings.

Total net periodic pension benefits cost was $12.6 million in 2002, $10.6 million in 2001, and $2.9 million in 2000. Total net periodic pension benefits
cost is expected to be approximately $17 million in 2003. The expected increase in net periodic pension cost in 2003 from 2000 is primarily due to a decrease in asset returns and a decrease in the discount rate. The net periodic pension benefit cost
for 2003 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 6.25 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.

Actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets
will affect the amount of net periodic pension cost ultimately recognized. For purposes of determining the expected return on assets component of net periodic pension cost, the market-related value of assets is calculated by amortizing over a
five-year period any differences between actual and expected return on assets. Other differences between assumed and actual experience are deferred as unrecognized gains and losses. Unrecognized gains and losses in excess of SFAS No. 87,

Employers’ Accounting for Pensions

, minimum threshold requirements are amortized over a ten to fifteen year period.

Pension contributions in 2002 totaled $18.9 million, including $15.3 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit plans. The $15.3 million
contribution exceeded the minimum funding requirement. Our 2003 pension contributions are expected to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million.

See ITEM 8, Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further information regarding pension plans.



ITEM 7A.     QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk

We are exposed to
various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. Market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We use
derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

Interest rate risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities used to fund operations. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The table below summarizes our
floating and fixed rate debt obligations including the impact of interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2002. The average variable rates depicted below for the interest rate swaps are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve
at December 31, 2002.

Foreign currency
risk

We have entered into foreign currency swap agreements with a major financial institution to hedge firm foreign currency
commitments. As of December 31, 2002, the following table presents principal cash flows of our open currency swap agreements:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December
31, 2002 and 2001, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits
in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries
at December 31, 2002 and 2001, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective
January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, “

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31. Additionally, we report our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and non-U.S., that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in
companies of which we own 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting stock and have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, as a
result, our share of the earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in the statement of income. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which Pentair has less than a 20 percent ownership interest and we do not have the
ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value.

Certain balances have been reclassified to conform to the 2002 presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical
accounting policies that require our most significant estimates and judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and cost and equity method investments; and

•

accounting for pensions benefits, because of the importance in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Foreign currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the United States are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and
liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. The resultant translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity.
Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of exchange. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions of these subsidiaries are included in net earnings.

Cash equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts, reducing our receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers.

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customer’s financial condition and generally do not require collateral. In
addition, we also use credit insurance to minimize the risk on certain accounts. We encounter a certain amount of credit risk as a result of a concentration of receivables among a few significant customers. As of December 31, 2002, approximately 25
percent of our receivables were due from three large home improvement retailers.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned. Product revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence
of an arrangement exists, the product has been delivered and legal title and all risks of ownership have been transferred, written contract and sales terms are complete, customer acceptance has occurred, and payment is reasonably assured. We reduce
revenue for estimated product returns, allowances, and price discounts based on past experience.

In December 1999, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101,

Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements

, which among other guidance,
clarified the Staff’s views on various revenue recognition and reporting matters. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we changed our method of accounting for certain sales transactions to comply with SAB No. 101, and as a result, we reported a
change in accounting principle in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 20,

Accounting Changes

, by a cumulative effect adjustment.

Stock-based compensation

Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation

, we apply the recognition and measurement principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, to our stock options and other stock-based compensation plans.

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, compensation cost for stock options is recognized in income based on the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date of the award or
other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The exercise price for stock options granted to employees equals the fair market value of Pentair’s common stock at the date of grant, thereby resulting in no
recognition of compensation expense by Pentair.

The following
table illustrates the effect on income from continuing operations and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation. The estimated fair value of each Pentair option is
calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The weighted-average fair
value of options granted in 2002, 2001, and 2000 was $10.37, $7.17, and $10.93 per option, respectively. We estimated the fair values using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, modified for dividends and using the following assumptions:

The expected life was
determined separately for each plan due to varying exercise patterns. The fair value of options is amortized to expense over a three-year option-vesting period in determining the pro forma impact.

Shipping and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recorded in

Net sales

in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Shipping and
handling costs incurred by Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

Cost of goods sold

in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories of United States subsidiaries are generally determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventories of foreign-based
subsidiaries are determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) and moving average methods.

Property, plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is recorded at cost. We compute
depreciation by the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements
that add to productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation
are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in income.

Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the net
tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Identifiable intangible assets acquired in business combinations are recorded based upon fair market value at the date of acquisition.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No.
142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This statement requires that goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life not be amortized. Instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life,
the statement requires a test for impairment to be performed annually, or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist. We adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142 effective January 1, 2002, and as a



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

result, no longer record goodwill amortization. We completed our initial assessment of the recoverability of goodwill in the second quarter
of 2002, and we performed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2002 and found no impairment. The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow,
market comparable, and market capitalization approaches.

Had we
accounted for goodwill under SFAS No. 142 for all prior periods presented, our net income and earnings per share from continuing operations would have been as follows:

Our accounting policy
prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on January 1, 2002 was to amortize goodwill on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited, principally between 25 and 40 years.

Impairment of long-lived assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances
occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash
flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value.
Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair
value of long-lived assets.

Cost and equity method
investments

We have investments that are accounted for at historical cost or, if we have significant influence over the investee,
using the equity method. Pentair’s proportionate share of income or losses from investments accounted for under the equity method is recorded in the consolidated statements of income. We write down or write off an investment and recognize a
loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the investees’ financial condition, and in certain cases the possibility
of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the investees’



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

historical results of operations, and projected results and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different
from projections, we may incur future charges for the impairment of these investments.

Income taxes

Pentair uses the asset and liability approach to account for income
taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in
effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.

Environmental

We recognize environmental cleanup liabilities when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental cleanup is estimated by
engineering, financial, and legal specialists based on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible parties
(PRPs) will be able to fulfill their commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and severally liable. For closed or closing plants owned by Pentair and properties being sold, an estimated liability is typically recognized at the time the
closure decision is made or sale is recorded and is based on an environmental assessment of the plant property. The process of estimating environmental cleanup liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical
information and physical data relating to a contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multi-party
sites. In future periods, new laws or regulations, advances in cleanup technologies, and additional information about the ultimate cleanup remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.

Insurance subsidiary

We insure general and product liability, product recall, workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks through our wholly owned insurance
subsidiary. Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. As of the end of 2002 and 2001, reserves for policy claims were $27.0 million ($10.0 million included in

accrued product claims and
warranties

and $17.0 million included in

other noncurrent liabilities

) and $23.4 million ($10.0 million included in

accrued product claims and warranties

and $13.4 million included in

other noncurrent liabilities

).

Derivative financial instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as amended.
These standards require us to recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our balance sheet. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair
value of the derivative and the hedged item is recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative is recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and is
recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged item affects earnings. SFAS No. 133 defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to use
hedge accounting. For a derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are reported in earnings immediately.

Cumulative effect of accounting change

The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in an increase to other assets and other noncurrent liabilities of $7.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and a cumulative transition adjustment of $6.7 million in



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

OCI. The transition adjustment relates to our hedging activities through December 31, 2000. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, financial
instruments designated as hedges were not recorded in the financial statements, but cash flows from such contracts were recorded as adjustments to earnings as the hedged items affected earnings.

We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging interest
rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations. All hedging instruments are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133. We do not hold or issue derivative financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All other contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also meet the requirements of, and have been designated as, normal purchases or sales. Our policy is to not enter
into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net
income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effects of stock options. Unless
otherwise noted, references are to diluted earnings per share.

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated using the following:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Other newly adopted
accounting standards

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 01-9,

Accounting for
Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer or a Reseller of the Vendor’s Products

. This new standard requires that certain payments to our customers for cooperative advertising and certain sales incentive offers that were historically
classified as selling, general and administrative expense be reclassified and shown as a reduction in net sales. EITF Issue No. 01-9 also requires the reclassification of previously reported results of operations for periods prior to the adoption to
conform to the current presentation. Accordingly, previously reported net sales for 2001 and 2000 were reduced by $41.9 million and $42.4 million (with an offsetting reduction in selling expense), respectively. The adoption of this new standard had
no impact on previously reported operating income, net income, or earnings per share.

In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144,

Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets

. This standard supersedes SFAS No. 121,

Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for
Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of

; however, it retains the previously existing accounting requirements related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long-lived assets to be held and used while expanding the measurement
requirements of long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale to include discontinued operations. It also expands on the previously existing reporting requirements for discontinued operations to include a component of an entity that either has been
disposed of or is classified as held for sale. SFAS No. 144 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. The adoption of SFAS No. 144 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145,

Rescission of
FASB Statements No. 4, 44 and 62, amendment of FASB Statement No. 13 and Technical Corrections

. This new standard will require gains and losses on the extinguishments of debt to be classified as income or loss from continuing operations rather
than as extraordinary items as previously required under SFAS No. 4. Extraordinary treatment will be required for certain extinguishments as provided in APB Opinion No. 30. SFAS No. 145 also amends SFAS No. 13 to require certain modifications to
capital leases to be treated as a sale-leaseback and modifies the accounting for sub-leases when the original lessee remains a secondary obligor (or guarantor). SFAS No. 145 is effective for financial statements issued after May 15, 2002, and with
respect to the impact of the reporting requirements of changes made to SFAS No. 4, for fiscal years beginning after May 15, 2002. The adoption of these provisions did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of
operations. Pentair will adopt the remaining provisions of SFAS No. 145 in 2003. We do not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

New accounting standards to be adopted in the future

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

. This new standard addresses
financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that
result from the acquisition, construction, development, and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2002. We will adopt SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 and have determined that the adoption of this new standard will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated
with Exit or Disposal Activities

. This new standard nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring)

.
SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by SFAS No. 144, be recognized when the



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

liability is incurred, rather than the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal
activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. We will adopt SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. We do not expect that SFAS No. 146 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or
results of operations.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS
No. 148,

Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation — Transition and Disclosure — an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123

. SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of
accounting for stock-based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for
stock-based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. Pentair will continue to account for stock-based compensation in accordance with APB Opinion No. 25. As such, we do not expect this standard will have a
material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We adopted the disclosure-only provisions of SFAS No. 148 at December 31, 2002.

In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for
Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

. Interpretation No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees. It also clarifies that at the time an entity issues a
guarantee, the issuing entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. However, the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of
the guarantor’s obligations does not apply to product warranties, guarantees accounted for as derivatives, or other guarantees of an entity’s own future performance. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of
December 31, 2002. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. We have not yet determined the effect of adopting the initial recognition and
measurement provisions on Pentair’s consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE), an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

, which requires all VIEs to be consolidated by the
primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the VIE. In addition, the interpretation expands disclosure requirements for both VIEs that are consolidated as well as VIEs from which
the entity is the holder of a significant amount of the beneficial interests, but not the majority. The disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003. The consolidation
requirements of this interpretation are effective for all periods beginning after June 15, 2003. We do not expect the adoption of this new standard to have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

Acquisitions

On September 30, 2002, we acquired 100 percent of the common stock of Plymouth Products, Inc. and affiliated entities (Plymouth Products) from USF
Consumer & Commercial WaterGroup, a unit of Vivendi Environnement, for $120.4 million in cash, net of cash acquired, plus debt assumed of approximately $1.1 million. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $8.0
million. Goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition was $79.7 million. The purchase price is subject to final adjustment based on audited net assets. Plymouth Products is a manufacturer of water filtration products used in residential, commercial,
and industrial applications.

On October 1, 2002, we acquired 100
percent of the common stock of privately held Oldham Saw Co., Inc. and affiliated entities (Oldham Saw) for $49.9 million cash, net of cash acquired plus debt assumed of approximately



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

$1.5 million. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $10.1 million. Goodwill recorded as part of the
acquisition was $29.9 million. Pursuant to an earn-out provision, the purchase price could increase depending on Oldham Saw achieving certain net sales and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) targets over the
next two years. Any contingent payments based on meeting the earn-out conditions would be considered additional goodwill when earned. Oldham Saw designs, manufactures, and markets router bits, circular saw blades, and related accessories for the
do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional power tool markets.

In the
first quarter of 2001, we acquired Metalurgica Taunus Ltda. (Taunus), a Brazilian enclosures manufacturer, for $6.9 million cash, plus debt assumed of approximately $1.6 million. Goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition was $5.8 million.

The above acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and
the results of the acquisitions are included in our consolidated statements of income since the respective acquisition dates. The initial allocation of purchase price for the 2002 acquisitions was based on preliminary estimates and may be revised as
better information becomes available in 2003. We do not believe that the final purchase price allocation will produce materially different results than those reflected in our consolidated balance sheet.

In the second quarter of 2001, we received $5.0 million for the settlement of
a purchase price dispute related to a 1999 acquisition. The amount received was accounted for as a reduction of goodwill.

3.

Discontinued Operations/Divestitures

In December 2000, we adopted a plan to sell our Equipment segment businesses, Service Equipment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) and Lincoln
Industrial, Inc. (Lincoln Industrial). In October 2001, we completed the sale of the Service Equipment businesses to Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of $18.2 million. In December 2001, we completed the sale of Lincoln Industrial to
affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan), other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial for total consideration of $78.4 million, including a preferred stock interest. The selling price of Lincoln Industrial was subject to a
final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in January 2003, in which we paid Jordan $2.4 million.

Our financial statements have been restated to reflect the Equipment segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Operating results of the discontinued Equipment segment are
summarized below. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead previously allocated to the Equipment segment. The amounts include an allocation of interest based on a ratio of the net assets of the discontinued operations to the total net assets
of Pentair.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Net assets of the
discontinued Equipment segment consisted of the following:

Net assets of the
discontinued Equipment segment as of the end of 2002 consisted of consigned inventory and certain property and equipment that were not included in the sale of our Service Equipment business. These assets have been stated at estimated net realizable
value, and we expect to complete their disposal in 2003.

Restructuring Charge

2000 Restructuring Charge

To reduce
costs and improve productivity and accountability, we initiated a restructuring program in the fourth quarter of 2000 to decentralize corporate service functions and reorganize our Tools segment infrastructure. As a result, we recorded a
restructuring charge of $26.8 million. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a final change in estimate that reduced the restructuring charge by $1.7 million primarily due to favorable negotiation of contract termination costs. As of the end of
2001, this restructuring program was complete.

Restructuring Charge

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we initiated a restructuring program designed to consolidate manufacturing
operations and eliminate non-critical support facilities in our Enclosures segment. We also wrote off internal-use software development costs at corporate for the abandonment of a company-wide human resource system. Consequently, we recorded a
restructuring charge of $42.8 million, of which $1 million is included in

cost of goods sold

on the consolidated statement of income for the write-down of inventory on certain custom enclosures product that were discontinued as a result of
plant closures.

The major components of the 2000 and 2001
restructuring charges and remaining restructuring liability follows:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Included in

other
current liabilities

on the consolidated balance sheets is the unused portion of the restructuring charge liability of $3.6 million, primarily related to severance obligations not yet paid to certain terminated individuals and other charges as we
are awaiting the results of pending and threatened litigation proceedings, and therefore, are uncertain when this remaining liability will be paid. Funding of future payments will be paid from cash generated from operating activities.

As a result of our 2000 restructuring charge program, we reduced our workforce
by approximately 225 employees. Workforce reductions related to the 2001 restructuring charge are for approximately 884 employees, of whom 867 were terminated in 2001 and 2002. Employee termination benefits consist primarily of severance and
outplacement counseling fees. Employee termination benefits for the 2001 restructuring charge includes a $0.4 million non-cash charge for the intrinsic value of stock options modified as part of a severance agreement.

Non-cash asset disposals for the 2000 and 2001 restructuring charges were for
the write-down of equipment, leasehold improvements, and inventory (2001 only) as a direct result of our decisions to exit certain facilities and the abandonment of internal use software under development. Exit costs are primarily related to
contract and lease termination costs.

The following table
summarizes the components of the 2000 and 2001 restructuring charges by segment, net of changes in estimates:

Certain inventories are
valued at LIFO. If all inventories were valued at FIFO as of the end of 2002 and 2001, inventories would have been $296.7 million and $305.6 million, respectively.

Equity method investments

We have invested approximately $24.9 million to acquire a 40 percent interest in certain joint venture operations of an Asian supplier for bench top power tools, of which $4.5 million was paid in 2002 and $20.4 million was
paid in 2001. We hold options to increase our ownership interest in these joint ventures to 100 percent. Our portion of the earnings of these joint ventures is included in

cost

; however, it is not material.

Cost method investments

As part of the sale of Lincoln Industrial, we received 37,500 shares of 5% Series C Junior Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock convertible into a 15
percent equity interest in the new organization — LN Holdings Corporation. The preferred stock has a $37.5 million face value, but has been recorded at $18.4 million, which represents the estimated fair value of that investment at the time of
sale.

In July 2002, we invested an additional $5.0 million for a
total investment of $10.0 million in the preferred stock of a privately held developer and manufacturer of laser leveling and measuring devices.

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss

Components of accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of the following:

Debt

Credit facilities

As of December 31, 2002, we had $652 million in committed
revolving credit facilities (the Facilities) with various banks consisting of a $242 million 364-day facility that expires on August 28, 2003, and $410 million of multi-currency facilities, of which $20 million expires on August 8, 2004 and $390
million expires on September 2, 2004. Interest rates and fees on the Facilities vary based on our credit ratings.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Our current credit ratings
are as follows:

Rating Agency

Long-Term Debt Rating

Standard & Poor’s

BBB

Moody’s

Baa3

The weighted-average
interest rate for borrowings under the Facilities during 2002 and 2001 was 3.09 percent and 5.52 percent, respectively. Credit available under existing facilities, as limited by our most restrictive financial covenant, was approximately $227 million
and is based on a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). In addition, our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount we pay for dividends and require us to
maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2002.

In addition to the Facilities, we have $40.0 million of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had $0.7 million outstanding as of December 31,
2002.

Long-term debt and the average interest rate on debt
outstanding as of December 31 is summarized as follows:

Long-term debt
outstanding at December 31, 2002 matures as follows:

10.

Derivative and Financial Instruments

Cash-flow hedges

We have
entered into interest rate swap agreements with a major financial institution to exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for fixed rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts in order to manage interest rate
exposures. As of the end of 2002, we had variable to fixed rate swap agreements outstanding with an aggregate notional amount of $55 million that expire in various amounts through June 2005. The swap agreements have a fixed interest rate of 6.31
percent.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

In addition, we have
entered into foreign currency swap agreements with a major financial institution to hedge firm foreign currency commitments. The currency swap agreements mature on October 1, 2003. The notional amounts were $100 million in both 2002 and 2001. The
currency swaps have terms that match the hedged exposure, thus no ineffectiveness is recorded.

The variable to fixed interest rate and currency swaps are designated as and are effective as cash-flow hedges. The fair values of these swaps are recorded on the balance sheet, with changes in fair
values included in OCI. Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense is recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs. We estimate $1.6 million of net derivative
losses will be reclassified into earnings in 2003. No hedging relationships were de-designated during 2002.

Fair value hedge

In March 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap
agreement to effectively convert interest rate expense on $100 million of Senior notes for the term of the notes (maturing October 2009) from a 7.85 percent fixed annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 2.49
percent. This swap agreement was designated and effective for as a fair value hedge. In September 2002, we terminated this swap agreement and received $8.2 million. This amount, net of accumulated amortization, is recorded as a premium to the
carrying amount of the notes in the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the Senior notes. The $8.2 million is also shown in the 2002 consolidated statement of cash flows as
an increase in o

ther assets and liabilities

.

Concurrent
with the sale of the interest rate swap, we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert $100 million of Senior notes for the term of the notes (maturing October 2009) from a 7.85 percent fixed annual rate to a
floating annual rate equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 3.91 percent (7.65 percent at December 31, 2002). This swap agreement has been designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge. Since this swap qualifies for the short-cut method
under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of the swap (included in

other assets

in the consolidated balance sheets) are offset by changes in the fair value of the designated debt being hedged. Consequently, there is no impact on net
income or shareholders’ equity.

Fair value of
financial instruments

The recorded amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, including derivative financial
instruments, were as follows:

The following methods
were used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instrument:

•

short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable, and short-term borrowings) — recorded
amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity period;



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

•

long-term debt, including current maturities — fair value is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt with similar terms;

•

interest rate swap agreements — fair value is based on market or dealer quotes; and

•

currency swap — fair value is based on market or dealer quotes.

11.

Income Taxes

Income from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:

The provision for
income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following:

Reconciliation of the
U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for continuing operations follows:

Deferred taxes arise
because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets” (generally items that
can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities” (generally items that we received a tax deduction for, but not yet been recorded in the consolidated statements of income).



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

United States income taxes
have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so. Accordingly, we believe that any U.S.
tax on repatriated earnings would be substantially offset by U.S. foreign tax credits.

The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities are:

The determination of
annual income tax expense takes into consideration amounts, which may be needed to cover exposures for open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examined our U.S. federal income tax returns through 1997, and we have paid all tax claims.
We do not expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years; however, actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.

At December 31, 2002, approximately $19.0 million non-U.S. tax losses were available for indefinite carryforward. We believe
that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective countries to allow us to fully recover these tax losses, thus no valuation allowance has been provided.

12.

Benefit Plans

Pension and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based principally on an employee’s years of service and/or compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also
provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life insurance plans require contributions from retirees.

The major assumptions used for these plans consisted of:

The

expected return on plan assets for determining 2003 net periodic benefit cost will be 8.5 percent.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Components of the net
periodic benefit cost are as follows:

The following tables
present reconciliations of the benefit obligation of the plans, the plan assets of the pension plans, and the funded status of the plans:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Plan assets consist
primarily of listed stocks and bonds as well as cash and short-term investments. Our common stock accounted for approximately 7 percent and 11 percent of plan assets as of the end of 2002 and 2001, respectively. Of the $150.3 million underfunding at
December 31, 2002, $67.6 million or 45 percent relates to foreign pension plans and our supplemental executive retirement plan which are not commonly funded.

During 2002, asset returns for our domestic benefit plans were adversely affected by continued deterioration in the equity markets. At the same time,
long-term corporate AA utility bonds, which were used to determine the discount rate for future pension obligations, continued to decline. Lower asset returns and declining discount rates unfavorably affected our 2002 year-end funded status and
increased our pension expense and plan contributions.

Amounts
recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:

At December 31, 2002, we
recorded an increase to the minimum pension liability of $49 million, resulting in a net of tax charge to shareholders’ equity of $29.2 million.

Pension contributions in 2002 totaled $18.9 million, including $15.3 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans. The $15.3 million
contribution exceeded the minimum funding requirement. Our 2003 pension contributions are expected to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million.

Pension plans with obligations in excess of plan assets were as follows:

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Savings plan

We have a 401(k) plan (the plan) with an employee stock ownership (ESOP) bonus component, which covers certain union and nearly
all-nonunion U.S. employees who meet certain age requirements. Under the plan, eligible U.S. employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation. Matching contributions are made in cash to employees who meet certain
eligibility and service requirements. Our matching contribution is based on our financial performance and ranges from 30 percent to 90 percent of eligible employee contributions, limited to 4 percent of compensation contributed by employees.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet
certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP contribution equal to 1.5 percent of annual eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the 401(k) and ESOP were approximately $9.0 million, $9.8 million, and $11.9 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively.

13.

Shareholders’ Equity

Authorized shares

We may issue
up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those shares as preferred stock.

Common share purchase rights

We
have a ten-year Rights Agreement dated July 31, 1995. Under this agreement, each outstanding share of our common stock has one common share purchase right attached to it and entitles the holder to purchase one share of our common stock, currently at
a price of $80 per share, subject to adjustment. However, these rights are not exercisable unless certain change-in-control events transpire, such as a person acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of
our outstanding common stock.

The rights are redeemable by us
for $0.01 per right until ten business days after certain defined change-in-control events transpire, or at any time prior to the expiration of the rights.

Share repurchases

In December
2002, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to 400,000 shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions to partially offset dilution due to normal grants of restricted shares and options to employees. No shares
have been purchased pursuant to this authority. In 2001 and 2000, respectively, we repurchased 50,000 and 13,700 shares of our common stock under similar plans.

14.

Stock Plans

Omnibus stock incentive plan

In
April 2001, the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended and Restated (the Plan) was approved. The Plan authorizes the issuance of additional shares of our common stock and extends through February 2006. The Plan allows for the granting of:

The Plan is administered
by our Compensation Committee (the Committee), which is made up of independent members of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards under the Plan are managerial,



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

administrative, or other key employees who are in a position to make a material contribution to the continued profitable growth and long-term
success of Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards, establish certain terms and conditions of award grants, and take certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The
Plan provides that no more than 20 percent of the total shares available for issuance under the Plan may be used to make awards other than stock options and limits the Committee’s authority to reprice awards or to cancel and reissue awards at
lower prices.

Incentive stock options

Under the Plan we may grant stock options to any eligible employee with an exercise price equal to the market value
of the shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date.

Restricted stock, rights to restricted stock and ICUs

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded restricted shares or rights to restricted shares (awards) of our
common stock and ICUs. Restrictions on awards and ICUs generally expire from two to five years after issuance, subject to continuous employment and certain other conditions. Restricted stock awards are recorded at market value on the date of the
grant as unearned compensation. Unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of shareholders’ equity in our consolidated financial statements and is being amortized to expense over the restriction period. The value of ICUs is based on a
matrix, which takes into account growth in operating income and return on invested capital. Annual expense for the value of restricted stock and ICUs was $7.9 million in 2002, $5.8 million in 2001, and $0.1 million in 2000.

Outside directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options are granted to outside directors under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan) with an
exercise price equal to 100 percent of the market value of the shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years after the grant
date. The Directors Plan extends to January 2008.

Business Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following business segments:

•

Tools

— manufactures and markets tool power products positioned at the mid- to upper-end of the market and targets non-professional DIY
(do-it-yourself), upscale hobbyists, and professional end users. Tools segment products include woodworking machinery, portable power tools, power tool accessories, metal and stoneworking tools, pneumatic tools, compressors, generators, and pressure
washers.

•

Water

— manufactures and markets essential products for the transport, storage, and treatment of water and wastewater. Water segment products
include water and wastewater pumps, control valves, pumps and pumping stations, storage tanks, filtration cartridges and systems, and pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Enclosures

— designs, manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components. Markets
served include industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases,
subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal management systems.

•

Other

— is primarily composed of unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested
operations, and intercompany eliminations.

The
accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on the operating income of the segment and use a variety of ratios to measure performance.

•

restructuring charge expense of $5.4 million in 2000; and

•

working capital charges of $30 million in 2000 to establish additional accounts receivable ($22 million) and inventory valuation ($8 million) reserves.

Enclosures segment operating income includes:

•

restructuring charge expense (income) of $39.4 million in 2001 and $(1.6) million in 2000 (due to a change in estimate of the 1999 restructuring liability).

Other segment operating income includes:

•

restructuring charge expense of $1.7 million in 2001 and $21.0 million in 2000.

The following table
presents certain geographic information:

Net sales are based on
the location in which the sale originated. Long-lived assets include property, plant, and equipment, and goodwill, net of related depreciation and amortization.

We sell our products through various distribution channels including home centers and retail chains. In 2002, sales to The
Home Depot and Lowes, major customers of our Tools segment, accounted for approximately 13.2 percent and 10.3 percent of total net sales, respectively. In 2001 and 2000, sales to The Home Depot accounted for approximately 12.8 percent and 10.5
percent of total net sales, respectively. In addition, three customers accounted for about 62 percent of our Tools segment net sales in 2002 and 58 percent in both 2001 and 2000. In our Water segment, two customers accounted for about 17 percent, 18
percent, and 9 percent of that segment’s sales in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. If these customers were lost, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.

Net rental expense under operating leases follows:

Future minimum lease
commitments under non-cancelable operating leases, principally related to facilities, vehicles, and machinery and equipment, is as follows:

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental cleanups, in
which our current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or
results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

business in 1995, as well as the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, we have retained responsibility
and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites, including one site in Los Angeles, California. This was acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999 and relates to operations no
longer carried out at that site. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and
acquired businesses. When it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of
December 31, 2002, our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately $10 million. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and
liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Litigation

We are occasionally a party to litigation arising in the normal course of
business. We regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable liabilities based on the expected eventual disposition of these matters. We believe the effect on our consolidated results of operations and
financial position, if any, for the disposition of all currently pending matters will not be material.

Warranties and guarantees

From time to time in connection with the disposition
of businesses or product lines, Pentair may agree to indemnify purchasers for various potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or other obligations. The subject matter,
amounts, and duration of any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of liability indemnified against and may vary widely from transaction to transaction. Pentair currently has outstanding indemnification obligations for environmental
matters relating to certain sold businesses that have four- to five-year indemnification periods, and one that lasts indefinitely. Other currently outstanding indemnity obligations have a one-year duration. The maximum potential payment for these
obligations is unlimited.

We accrue for costs associated with
guarantees when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of
estimates is more likely, the minimum is accrued.

We provide
service and warranty policies on our products. Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a review of historical warranty and service claim experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience
warrant. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to service our products in connection with product performance issues.

In 2002, we issued financial stand-by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance
programs, certain legal matters, and other commitments in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2002, we had stand-by letters of credit outstanding of $16.7 million.

Effective January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This new standard requires that goodwill and intangible assets
deemed to have an indefinite life no longer be amortized. This standard did not require restatement of prior period amounts to be consistent with the current year presentation. Certain financial information has been presented to show the effect of
excluding goodwill amortization for the prior year periods to be comparable with the current year presentation.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

(a)

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures

We maintain a system of disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of our published financial statements and other disclosures included in this
report. Within the 90-day period prior to the date of this report, we evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure
controls and procedures were effective as of the date of such evaluation in timely alerting them to material information relating to Pentair, Inc. (including its consolidated subsidiaries) required to be included in reports we file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.

(b)

Changes in Internal Controls

There have been no significant changes in our internal controls or in other factors which could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the date that we carried out our evaluation.
