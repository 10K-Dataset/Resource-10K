BUSINESS AND PRODUCTS

WATER GROUP

Our Water Group is a
global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement, treatment, storage and enjoyment of water. The Water Group offers a broad array of products and systems to multiple markets and customers. We have identified
a target water industry totaling $50 billion, with a primary focus on three markets: Pump (approximately 40% of sales), Pool & Spa (approximately 30% of sales) and Filtration (approximately 30% of sales).

Customers

Our Water Group distributes its products through wholesale distributors, retail distributors, original equipment manufacturers, and home centers. Information regarding
significant customers in our Water Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of
markets within our Water segment. End user demand for pool/spa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from March to July. The magnitude of the sales spike is somewhat mitigated through effective use of the distribution
channel by employing some advance sales programs (generally including extended payment terms). Demand for residential water systems are also impacted by weather patterns particularly related to droughts and heavy flooding.

Competition

Our Water segment faces numerous domestic and international competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources. Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are continuing trends in the water industry.
Competition in commercial and residential pump markets focuses on brand names, product performance, quality, and price. While home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps, they are much less
important in commercial pumps. For municipal pumps, competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications, service, and price. Competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design, quality,
delivery, and price. For pool and spa equipment, there are a number of competitors. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels and reputation
for quality also contribute to our continuing industry penetration.



ENCLOSURES GROUP

Our Enclosures Group is a global leader that designs, manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components
and accessories. The Enclosures Group focuses its business portfolio on four primary industries: Commercial & Industrial (35% of segment), Telecom and Datacom (35% of segment), Electronics (25% of segment), and Networking (5% of segment). The
segment goes to market under four primary trade marks: Hoffman

®

, Schroff

®

, Pentair
Electronic Packaging

™

, and Taunus

™

. Products and related accessories include metallic and
composite enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal management systems. Applications served include industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical,
security, defense, and general electronics.

Customers

Our Enclosures Group distributes its products through original equipment manufacturers, electrical and data contractors, and electrical and
electronic components distributors. Information regarding significant customers in our Enclosures Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Seasonality

The Enclosures segment is not significantly impacted by seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the enclosures markets can be
intense, particularly in telecom and datacom markets, where product design, prototyping, global supply, and customer service are significant factors. The overall global decline in market demand from mid 2001 through mid 2003 has created excess
capacity throughout the industry. Despite the retrenchment of virtually all participants in these markets and some recent improvement in end-user demand, price competition remains intense. Our Enclosures segment has continued to focus on cost
control and improving profitability on a sequential quarter to quarter basis. Recent growth in the Enclosures segment is a result of continued channel penetration, growth in targeted market segments, new product development, geographic expansion,
and overall market growth. Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are visible trends in the enclosures marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier. We believe our Enclosures business has the
broadest array of products available for commercial and industrial uses.

Business segment and geographical financial information is contained in ITEM 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Growth of our business

We continually look at each of our
businesses to determine whether they fit with our evolving strategic vision. Our primary focus is on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities, especially in international markets. We seek growth through product and service
innovation, market expansion, and acquisitions. Acquisitions have played an important part in the growth of our business and will continue to be an important part of our growth in the future.

Acquisitions

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR, Inc. (“WICOR”) from Wisconsin Energy Corporation (“WEC”) for $889.6 million, including a third
quarter cash payment of $871.1 million, cash acquired of $15.5 million, transaction costs of $5.8 million, plus debt assumed of $21.6 million. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we received the $14.0 million final purchase price adjustment, a $0.3
million decrease in cash acquired, and recorded an additional $5.1 million in transaction costs. The acquisition was effected pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated February 3, 2004, among the Company, WICOR and WEC. Our acquisition of WICOR,
which manufactures water systems, filtration and pool equipment



marketed primarily under the STA-RITE

®

, SHURflo

®

and Hypro

®

brands, has created a $2 billion water business with approximately 8,200 employees worldwide known as Pentair Water. We funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR acquisition
with an $850 million committed line of credit (the “Bridge Facility”) and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility.

On December 31, 2003, we acquired all of the common stock of Everpure, Inc. (“Everpure”), from United States Filter Corporation, a unit of Veolia
Environnement, for $217.3 million in cash, including cash acquired of $5.5 million and transaction costs of $2.2 million. Everpure is a leading global provider of water filtration products for the commercial and consumer sectors.

During 2003, we also completed four product line acquisitions in our Water segment for total
consideration of $21.4 million in cash including transaction costs: Hydrotemp Manufacturing Co., Inc., Letro Products, Inc. and certain assets of TwinPumps, Inc. and K&M Plastics, Inc.

These acquisitions were financed through available lines of credit and cash flow from
operations.

Also refer to ITEM 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis,
and ITEM 8, Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Discontinued operations/divestitures

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we completed the
sale of our Tools Group to The Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”) for approximately $796.8 million in cash, including a $21.8 million interim net asset value increase, subject to post-closing adjustments. The Tools Group was comprised
of the Porter-Cable

®

, Delta

®

, DeVilbiss Air Power, Oldham Saw, and FLEX

®

brands, among others. The disposition was effected
pursuant to a Purchase Agreement between BDK and Pentair dated July 16, 2004. We used the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and borrowings under our credit facility to repay the $850 million Bridge Facility, used to acquire WICOR, on October 4,
2004. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a loss on the disposal of the Tools Group of $6.0 million, net of a tax provision of $9.0 million.

In 2001, we completed the sale of the Service Equipment businesses (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) to Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of $18.2
million and we completed the sale of Lincoln Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan), other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial for total consideration of $78.4 million, including a preferred stock
interest. In January 2003, we paid $2.4 million for a final adjustment to the selling price related to the disposition of Lincoln Industrial, which was offset by a previously established reserve. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we reported an
additional loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million primarily due to a reduction in estimated proceeds related to exiting two remaining facilities.

Also refer to ITEM 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

INFORMATION REGARDING ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Backlog

Our backlog of orders from continuing operations as of December 31 by segment was:

The $43.6 million increase in Water
segment backlog was primarily due to the acquisition of WICOR offset by the timing of orders in our pool business. The $16.9 million increase in Enclosures segment backlog reflects



order growth in our modified standard and custom enclosures business, which tends to have longer lead-time orders than our component business sold through
distribution. Due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice, backlog, which typically represents less than 30 days of shipments, is not deemed to be a significant item for our business. A substantial portion of our
revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month. We expect that most of our backlog at December 31, 2004 will be filled in 2005.

Research and development

We conduct research and development
activities in our own facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new products, product applications, and manufacturing processes. Research and development expenditures during 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $31.5 million, $22.9 million, and
$19.0 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7, and in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Raw materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), and paint (powder and liquid). In
addition to the purchase of raw materials, some finished goods are purchased for distribution through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market, and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate
supply. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages to-date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe
that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist, and we believe that the termination of any of
these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations.

Certain commodities, such as steel, are subject to market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with escalator / de-escalator clauses. Prices for raw
materials, such as steel, may continue to trend higher in the future.

Intellectual property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trade marks, trade names,
and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer relationship, trade mark, trade name, or brand name.

Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire or terminate
over time by operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications, and license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations
or cash flows.

Employees

As of December 31, 2004, Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries employed an aggregate of approximately 12,900 people worldwide. Total employees in the United States were
approximately 9,300, of whom approximately 900 are represented by six different trade unions having collective bargaining agreements. Generally, labor relations have been satisfactory.

Captive Insurance Subsidiary

We
insure general and product liability, property, workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald Insurance Company (Penwald). Reserves for policy claims are
established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as liabilities retained from acquired businesses, pre-1992 liabilities and those of certain foreign operations, are
established without regard to the availability of insurance.



Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Available information

We make available free of charge (other than an investor’s own Internet access charges) through our Internet website
(

http://www.pentair.com

) our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reports of beneficial ownership filed by our directors and executive officers pursuant
to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are also available on our website. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our
principal executive office is in leased premises located in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Manufacturing operations are carried out at approximately 33 plants located throughout the United States and at 31 plants located in 12 other countries. In
addition, we have approximately 65 distribution facilities and 48 sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world. We also lease one idle facility.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes, product liability, environmental, safety and
health, patent infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the
requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is
probable and can be reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable estimate of
the probable loss is a range, we record the most likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not recorded until
realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in
future charges that could have a material adverse impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on
experience and developments in litigation. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal
Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental cleanups, in which our
current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of
operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company
ammunition business in 1997, the disposition



of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain
environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of
retained responsibilities. We settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999, that relates to operations no longer carried out at that
site. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired
businesses. When it is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability, with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As
of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately $9.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, measured on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or
become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Product liability claims

We are subject to various product
liability lawsuits and personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is
probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. We have not experienced
significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims.

Horizon litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29
primary plaintiffs, a class action, and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise Lines, Inc. (Celebrity) were brought against Essef Corporation (Essef) and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of Essef in August 1999. Celebrity has
alleged that it had sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the M/V Horizon while it was dry-docked.

The claims against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the allegation that Essef designed, manufactured, and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on
the Horizon, and allegations that the spa and filters contained Legionnaire’s disease bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from December 1993 through July 1994.

The individual and class claims by passengers were tried and resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the part of the Essef
defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister company, Fantasia (together 30%).

After exhaustion of post-trial appeals, we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of $7.0 million in the Horizon cases, plus interest of approximately $1.6 million in January 2004. We had reserved for the amount of punitive damages
awarded at the time of the Essef acquisition. A reserve for the $1.6 million interest cost was recorded in 2003.

All of the personal injury cases have now been resolved through either settlement or trial. The only remaining unresolved case is that brought by Celebrity for
interruption of its business. In 2004, Celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and costs for prior litigation and damages for out-of-pocket losses, lost profits, and loss of business enterprise value. Discovery commenced late in
2004. We believe our reserves for any liability to Celebrity are adequate and intend to vigorously defend against these claims.

PART II

ITEM 5.    MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED SECURITY HOLDER

MATTERS
AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Pentair’s common stock is
listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “PNR.” As of December 31, 2004, there were 3,995 shareholders of record.

The high, low, and closing sales price for our common stock and the dividends declared for each of the quarterly periods for 2004 and 2003 were as follows:

Pentair has paid 116 consecutive
quarterly dividends.

On May 17, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a
2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on June 8, 2004, to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2004. All share and per share information presented in this Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the
effect of this stock split.

Purchases of Equity Securities

The following table provides information with respect to purchases made by Pentair of common stock during the fourth quarter of 2004:

(a)

The purchases in this column include 63,440 shares for October 3 — October 30, 135,950 shares for October 31 — November 27, and 234,529 shares for November 28
— December 31 relating to the deemed surrender to the company by plan participants of shares of common stock to satisfy the exercise price related to the exercise of employee stock options.

(b)

In December 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the development of a program and process to annually repurchase up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, on a post
stock-split basis, in open market or privately negotiated transactions to partially offset dilution due to normal grants of restricted shares to employees. The authorization expired on December 31, 2004.

In December 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the development of a
program and process to annually repurchase shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. There is no expiration associated with the authorization granted.

As of February 18, 2005, no shares have been repurchased and accordingly, we have the authority to repurchase shares up to a
maximum dollar limit of $25 million.



ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA

*

All share and per share information presented in this Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of a 100% stock dividend in 2004 and 1996.



ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA – (continued)

(1)

Effective January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This standard requires goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an
indefinite life no longer be amortized. This standard did not require restatement of prior period amounts to be consistent with the current year presentation and therefore, we have not made any adjustments to the historical financial information
presented. However, we have provided supplemental tax and diluted EPS information as we believe it is necessary to the understanding of our financial performance trend.

(2)

Calculated using a 13-month average.

In 2004, we divested our Tools Group. Our financial statements have been restated to reflect the Tools Group as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The
2004 results reflect a pre-tax gain on the sale of the Tools Group of $3.0 million ($6.0 million loss after tax).

In 2002, capital expenditures from discontinued operations included $23.0 million for the acquisition of a previously leased facility.

In 2000, we discontinued our Equipment segment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive and
Lincoln Industrial businesses). Our financial statements have been restated to reflect the Equipment segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. The 2001 results reflected a pre-tax loss on the sale of these businesses of $36.3
million ($24.6 million loss after tax).

In 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, resulting in an increase to other assets and other noncurrent liabilities of $7.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and a cumulative transition adjustment of $6.7 million in
OCI. The transition adjustment relates to our hedging activities through December 31, 2000. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, financial instruments designated as hedges were not recorded in the financial statements, but cash flows from such
contracts were recorded as adjustments to earnings as the hedged items affected earnings.

In 2001, cost of goods sold included $1.0 million related to the 2001 restructuring charge for our Enclosures segment.

In 2000, operations reflected a non-cash pre-tax cumulative effect of accounting change related to revenue recognition that reduced income by $0.03 million, net of tax.

In 1997, operations included a pre-tax gain on the sale of Federal Cartridge
of $10.3 million ($1.2 million gain after tax).

Our accounting policy prior to
the adoption of SFAS No. 142 was to amortize goodwill on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited, principally between 25 and 40 years.

Reference should be made to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.



ITEM 7.

Overview

We
are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments: Water and Enclosures. Our Water Group is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement, treatment, storage
and enjoyment of water. Our Enclosures Group is a leader in the global enclosures market, designing and manufacturing standard, modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components. In 2005, our Water
Group and Enclosures Group are forecasted to generate approximately 75 percent and 25 percent of total revenues, respectively.

Our Water segment has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from $100 million in 1995 to approximately $1.6 billion
in 2004, or approximately $2.0 billion on a pro forma basis (as if Pentair’s water acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of 2004). The water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water and its
large global market, of which we have identified a target industry segment totaling $50 billion. Our vision is to become a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement, treatment, storage, and enjoyment of water.

As of July 31, 2004, we continued the expansion of our global footprint in the
water equipment industry through the acquisition of WICOR, a manufacturer of pumps, filtration and pool equipment marketed primarily under the STA-RITE

®

, SHURflo

®

and Hypro

®

brands. We funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR acquisition with an $850 million committed line of credit (the “Bridge Facility”)
and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility.

We continue to expect to achieve $30 million in synergies in the first full year of ownership with respect to the WICOR acquisition via key initiatives including PIMS, material cost savings and administrative cost savings. We also expect to
achieve significant working capital reductions, fixed asset reductions, and revenue synergies from cross-selling opportunities as a result of the acquisition. We have closed or consolidated nine former WICOR facilities. We are in the process of
closing or consolidating another six facilities and will complete the construction of a new water facility in Mexico in the first quarter of 2005. We expect the run rate of integration benefits to begin exceeding costs by the second quarter of 2005.

Our Enclosures segment operates in a large global market with significant
headroom in industry niches such as defense, security, medical, and networking. We believe we have the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in North America and highest brand recognition in the industry. From mid 2001 through mid
2003, the Enclosures segment experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial markets and over-capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets. In 2004, sales
volumes increased due to the addition of new distributors, new products, and higher demand in all targeted markets. In addition, through the success of our PIMS and supply management initiatives, we have increased Enclosures segment margins for
twelve consecutive quarters.

Effective after the close of business October 2,
2004, we completed the sale of our Tools Group to The Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”) for approximately $796.8 million in cash, including a $21.8 million interim net asset value increase, subject to post-closing adjustments. We used
the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and borrowings under our credit facility to repay the $850 million Bridge Facility, used to acquire WICOR, on October 4, 2004. We retained certain insurance liabilities, employee compensation and benefit
liabilities, environmental liabilities, pension obligations and post-retirement obligations of the Tools Group.

On May 17, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on June 8, 2004, to shareholders of record as
of June 1, 2004. All share and per share information presented in this Form 10-K has been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this stock split.



Key Trends and Uncertainties

The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2004 and will likely impact our results in the future:

Ÿ

In 2004, we achieved approximately 14 percent organic sales growth, which we define as net sales excluding the effects of both acquisitions and foreign currency translation.

Ÿ

We plan to drive strategic growth initiatives for both our Water and Enclosures platforms, with particular emphasis on international growth.

Ÿ

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our Water segment. End-user demand for pool/spa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from March
to July. The magnitude of the sales spike is somewhat mitigated through effective use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs (generally including extended payment terms). Demand for residential water systems are also
impacted by weather patterns particularly related to droughts and heavy flooding.

Ÿ

We expect our Water and Enclosures Groups to continue to benefit from our key initiatives, including supply management and PIMS.

Ÿ

We are experiencing material cost inflation in a number of our businesses. We are striving for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective increases in selling
prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as steel, resins, ocean freight and fuel, health care and insurance. In addition, the WICOR acquisition has increased our purchasing power, and we expect consolidating the Water
Group’s spending on raw materials and services to deliver savings, further cushioning the impact of material cost inflation.

Ÿ

Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, including both continuing and discontinued operations, exceeded $200 million for
the third consecutive year and is expected to be approximately $200 million in 2005. See our discussion of

Other financial measures

under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report.

Ÿ

In 2004, we experienced favorable foreign currency effects, primarily for the U.S. dollar against the Euro, which may not trend favorably in the future.

Ÿ

We expect our overall effective tax rate to be 36 percent in 2005. As a part of our acquisition and international strategies, we are pursuing rate reduction opportunities, which
could improve our effective tax rate.

Ÿ

We expect our Water Group operating income margins in each of the first two quarters of 2005 to be lower by roughly 100 basis points compared to the prior year comparable periods.
We expect the forecasted operating income margins will be affected by the lower former WICOR margins versus Pentair Water margins. In the future, we intend to drive margins in the expanded Water Group toward a goal of 15 percent, while capturing
growth opportunities.

Ÿ

In 2004, we reduced our outstanding debt by $70 million, which was driven by strong cash flows, while completing the largest acquisition and divestiture in our history.

Outlook

In 2005, our operating objectives include the following:

Ÿ

Continue to drive for operating excellence: lean enterprise initiatives and supply management practices, which we now collectively call Pentair Integrated Management System (PIMS)
and cash flow;

Ÿ

Complete the integration of the WICOR acquisition and realize identified synergistic opportunities;

Ÿ

Continue proactive talent management process building competencies in international management and other key functional areas;

Ÿ

Achieve significant organic sales growth (in excess of market growth), particularly in international markets; and

Ÿ

Continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our existing platforms in our Water and Enclosures segments.



RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net sales

The components of the net sales change were:

The 38.7 percent increase in
consolidated net sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

an increase in sales volume driven by our July 31, 2004 acquisition of WICOR and our December 31, 2003 acquisition of Everpure;

Ÿ

organic sales growth from continuing operations of approximately 14 percent, removing the effects of acquisitions and excluding foreign currency exchange;

Ÿ

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Enclosure segments to mitigate inflationary cost increases; and

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects as the weaker U.S. dollar increased the U.S. dollar value of foreign sales.

The 10.4 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the
result of:

Ÿ

sales attributable to our September 30, 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products;

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects as the weaker U.S. dollar increased the U.S. dollar value of foreign sales.

Sales by segment and the year-over-year changes were as follows:

Water

The 47.4 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

an increase in sales volume driven by our July 31, 2004 acquisition of WICOR and our December 31, 2003 acquisition of Everpure;

Ÿ

higher organic growth for pool and spa equipment by capturing a larger share of the increasing spend on the home environment, primarily through the expansion of our product
offerings, including the introduction of several new innovative products and product systems;

Ÿ

strong sales of pumps for residential water systems and sump pumps, somewhat driven by North American weather patterns, combined with strong demand for commercial and engineered
pumping systems;

Ÿ

significant growth in international markets;

Ÿ

an increase in the sales of water filtration products including residential and industrial tanks and valves in the U.S. and European markets, which was driven particularly in the
first half of 2004 by rebounding economic conditions consistent with increased housing starts and the low interest rate environment;

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects; and

Ÿ

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases.



The 13.7 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

sales attributable to our September 30, 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products;

Ÿ

higher sales of residential pumps and pool equipment;

Ÿ

an increase in European sales, particularly commercial valves, water conditioning and pool products;

Ÿ

continued growth in the developing markets of Asia and India; and

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects.

Enclosures

The 22.7 percent increase in Enclosures segment
sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

higher sales due to the addition of new distributors, new products, and higher demand from established industrial markets, as well as security, medical, networking, and commercial
markets;

Ÿ

some recovery in North American telecom and datacom demand;

Ÿ

an increase in European sales volume due to new customers and improved business activity at large OEMs, particularly in the test and measurement, automation and control, and telecom
markets, offset by a slowing European economy;

Ÿ

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases, principally for steel; and

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects.

The 4.8 percent increase in Enclosures segment sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects; and

Ÿ

growth in targeted areas such as networking, security, and medical markets.

Gross profit

The 1.5 percentage point increase
in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

cost leverage from our increase in sales volume;

Ÿ

savings generated from our key initiatives, supply management and PIMS;

Ÿ

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Enclosure segments to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

Ÿ

lower costs as a result of engineered cost reductions throughout Pentair; and

Ÿ

higher gross margins associated with our December 31, 2003 acquisition of Everpure.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

lower initial gross margins associated with our July 31, 2004 acquisition of WICOR;

Ÿ

the expensing of fair market value inventory adjustments related to inventory acquired in the Everpure and WICOR transactions.

The 1.6 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2003 from 2002
was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

savings generated from our supply management and PIMS initiatives;

Ÿ

improved productivity in our Enclosure and Water segments, particularly in our pump business; and

Ÿ

lower costs as a result of general downsizing throughout Pentair.



Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)

The 1.1 percentage point increase
in SG&A expense as a percent of sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

higher rebates, selling expenses, and management incentives due to strong sales growth in 2004;

Ÿ

higher SG&A expense associated with our December 31, 2003 acquisition of Everpure;

Ÿ

cost of outside support for integration planning and communications related to the WICOR acquisition;

Ÿ

expenses related to the consolidation of certain pump related facilities in our Water segment;

Ÿ

higher corporate governance costs, including Sarbanes-Oxley compliance and external audit fees, and increased general insurance costs;

Ÿ

less favorable foreign currency effects than in the prior comparable period; and

Ÿ

investments made to support future growth.

The 0.1 percent point decrease in SG&A expense as a percent of sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects; and

Ÿ

productivity improvements from PIMS initiatives in non-manufacturing areas.

These decreases were partially offset by

Ÿ

expenses related to downsizing throughout Pentair; and

Ÿ

strategic growth initiatives.

Research and development (R&D)

The unchanged R&D expense as a
percent of sales in 2004 from 2003 and the 0.1 percentage point increase in R&D expense as a percent of sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

increased spending for new product development initiatives that paced with the increase in sales.

Operating income

Water

The 1.0 percentage point decline in
Water segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

lower initial margins associated with our July 31, 2004 acquisition of WICOR;

Ÿ

inflationary cost increases, particularly as it related to the costs of motors and resins;

Ÿ

cost of outside support for integration planning and communications related to the WICOR acquisition;

Ÿ

the expensing of fair market value inventory adjustments related to inventory acquired in the Everpure and WICOR transactions; and

Ÿ

expenses related to factory capacity rationalization.



These decreases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

favorable operating leverage provided by supply management savings and productivity gains from higher sales volume;

Ÿ

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases; and

Ÿ

higher margins associated with our December 31, 2003 acquisition of Everpure.

The unchanged Water segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

benefits from the continued success of our PIMS and supply management initiatives;

Ÿ

increased volume in our expanding markets of Europe, Asia, and India; and

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects.

These benefits were offset by:

Ÿ

increased selling and R&D expense;

Ÿ

higher insurance costs in 2003; and

Ÿ

price and volume declines related to our desalination (CodeLine

®

) product line and costs associated with downsizing the Chardon, Ohio operation and moving most of this product line to our factory in India.

Enclosures

The 3.5 percentage point increase
in Enclosures segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

leverage gained on volume expansion;

Ÿ

savings from the continued success of PIMS and supply management activities;

Ÿ

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases; and

Ÿ

the absence of expenses associated with downsizing included in the comparable prior period.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

material cost inflation, primarily steel.

The 3.4 percentage point increase in Enclosures segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

efficiencies resulting from our continued implementation of PIMS and stronger sourcing practices;

Ÿ

volume-related efficiencies and improved product mix; and

Ÿ

shifting more production to lower-cost labor markets.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

expenses related to downsizing.

Net interest expense



The 41.0 percent increase in interest expense from continuing operations in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result
of:

Ÿ

higher debt levels resulting from the Everpure and WICOR acquisitions, including the Bridge Facility financing, partially offset by operating cash flows.

The 7.1 percent decrease in interest expense from continuing operations in 2003 from
2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

lower interest rates and outstanding loan balances, partially offset by interest expense related to the financing of our 2003 acquisitions and a $1.6 million charge for accrued
interest on the judgment in the Horizon litigation (refer to discussion in ITEM 3 of this Form 10-K).

Provision for income taxes

The 3.0 percentage point increase
in the tax rate in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

increased operating income coupled with the relatively fixed nature of many of our tax savings programs;

Ÿ

the higher level and mix of our 2004 U.S. and foreign earnings; and

Ÿ

our July 31, 2004 acquisition of WICOR which results in a higher effective tax rate.

The 4.7 percentage point increase in the tax rate in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

the increase and mix of our 2003 domestic and foreign earnings coupled with our tax savings programs that are relatively fixed in nature.

We expect our full year effective tax rate in 2005 to be 36 percent. We will continue to
pursue tax rate reduction opportunities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity
investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, and dividend payments are generally funded from cash generated from operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities, and in certain instances, public and private debt and
equity offerings.

We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal
demand in a number of markets within our Water segment. End-user demand for pool/spa equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from March to July. The magnitude of the sales spike is somewhat mitigated through effective use of
the distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs (generally including extended payment terms). Demand for residential water systems are also impacted by weather patterns particularly related to droughts and heavy flooding.

The following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated
from our monthly operating results based on a 13-month moving average and indicates our emphasis on working capital management:

Days

Days in accounts payable






Operating activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $264.1 million in 2004, or $1.2 million higher compared with the same period in 2003. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net
income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory builds to support customers during product transfers and plant consolidation activities in Water. The WICOR acquisition has increased our working capital ratios, primarily inventory days,
which will continue until our post-acquisition integration activities are farther along and our PIMS initiatives are better established.

In December 2004, we sold an approximate $22.0 million interest in a pool of accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution to mitigate the credit risk
associated with the receivable balance of a large customer. In compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

, sales of
accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. As the estimated
present value of the receivables sold approximated the carrying amount, no gain or loss was recorded in 2004.

Investing activities

Capital expenditures in 2004, 2003, and 2002 were $48.9 million, including $43.1 million
for continuing operations, $43.6 million, including $29.0 million for continuing operations, and $56.7 million, including $24.3 million for continuing operations, respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 to be approximately
$60 to $65 million, primarily for integration of WICOR businesses into existing or new facilities, selective increases in equipment capacity, new product development, and general maintenance capital.

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we completed the sale of our Tools
Group to BDK for approximately $796.8 million in cash, including a $21.8 million interim net asset value increase, subject to post-closing adjustments.

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR, Inc. (“WICOR”) from Wisconsin Energy Corporation for
$871.1 million in cash, including cash acquired of $15.5 million, transaction costs of $5.8 million, plus debt assumed of $21.6 million. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we received the $14.0 million final purchase price adjustment related to the July
31, 2004 acquisition of WICOR. The purchase price adjustment was a result of the final determination of closing date net assets. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a $0.3 million decrease in cash acquired and an additional $5.1
million in transaction costs.

On April 5, 2004, we acquired all of the
remaining stock of the Tools Group’s Asian joint venture for $21.8 million in cash, $6.4 million of which was paid following the sale of the Tools Group. The level of return on sales targets achieved in the second quarter of 2004 required a
payment of $0.9 million, which was recorded as an increase to goodwill. The acquisition included cash acquired of $6.2 million and debt assumed of $9.0 million. The investment in the Tools Group’s Asian joint venture business was sold as part
of the Tools Group to The Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”).

In
the second quarter of 2004, we paid $3.9 million in purchase price adjustments related to the December 31, 2003 acquisition of Everpure, Inc. (“Everpure”). The adjustment primarily related to the final determination of closing date net
assets.

In the first quarter of 2004, we paid $2.3 million for acquisition
fees primarily related to the December 31, 2003 acquisition of Everpure.

On
December 31, 2003, we acquired all of the common stock of Everpure from United States Filter Corporation, a unit of Veolia Environnement, for $217.3 million in cash, including cash acquired of $5.5 million and transaction costs of $2.2 million.



During 2003, we completed four product line acquisitions in our Water segment for total consideration of approximately
$21.4 million in cash including transaction costs.

In the first quarter of
2003, we received $1.9 million in purchase price adjustments related to our fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products. The adjustment primarily related to final determination of closing date net assets.

In January 2003, we paid $2.4 million for a final adjustment to the selling price related to
the disposition of Lincoln Industrial. This had no effect on earnings in 2003 as the amount was offset by previously established reserves.

Financing activities

Net cash used for financing activities
was $137.8 million in 2004 compared with net cash provided by financing activities of $33.8 million in 2003. Financing activities included the utilization and repayment of the $850 million committed line of credit (the “Bridge Facility”)
to fund the WICOR acquisition, draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business, dividend payments, share repurchases, and cash received from stock option exercises.

As of December 31, 2004, we had a $500 million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the
“Credit Facility”) with various banks expiring on July 25, 2006. On March 4, 2005, we amended and restated our multi-currency revolving Credit Facility, increasing the size of the facility from $500 million to $800 million with a term of
five years. The interest rate on the loans under the $800 million Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use the Credit
Facility as back-up liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2004, we had $178.0 million of commercial paper outstanding that matured within 44 days. All of the commercial paper was classified as long-term as we
have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility. Availability under our Credit Facility at December 31, 2004, including outstanding commercial paper, was approximately $268.0 million.

Effective following the close of business on July 31, 2004, we completed the
acquisition of WICOR. We funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR acquisition with the Bridge Facility and through additional borrowings available under our existing Credit Facility. The interest rate on
the Bridge Facility and loans under the Credit Facility during the period of the Bridge Facility was LIBOR plus 1.375%.

On October 4, 2004, we received approximately $796.8 million of proceeds from the sale of our Tools Group to BDK. As required under the terms of the Bridge Facility, we
used the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and additional borrowings under the Credit Facility to pay off the Bridge Facility. Following payment of the Bridge Facility and based on our existing credit ratings, the interest rate on loans under the
Credit Facility decreased to LIBOR plus 1.125%.

In addition to the Credit
Facility, we have $25 million of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had no borrowings as of December 31, 2004.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:



As a result of our announcement of an agreement to acquire WICOR in February 2004, Moody’s Investor Services
confirmed the long-term rating for our Credit Facilities of Baa3 and changed our outlook to negative from stable. At the same time, Standard and Poor’s Rating Services placed our BBB corporate credit and other ratings on CreditWatch with
negative implications. Following the completion of the sale of our Tools Group to BDK, Standard and Poor’s Rating Services affirmed our BBB corporate credit and other ratings, removed the CreditWatch and changed our outlook to negative. The
change in rating outlook to negative from stable was a reflection of Standard and Poor’s concern over integration risks associated with the acquisition of WICOR and an acquisitive growth strategy.

Also in February 2004, Moody’s Investor Services placed the Baa3 senior unsecured rating
on our $250 million notes and the Baa3 rating on our senior notes under our $225 million shelf registration under review for possible downgrade, due to structural subordination thereof. Existing lenders under our Credit Facility and private
placement notes benefit from guarantees from our domestic subsidiaries, while the $250 million senior note holders historically did not benefit from such guarantees. In connection with the closing of the WICOR acquisition, our domestic subsidiaries
executed a similar guarantee for the benefit of the $250 million senior note holders to avoid a downgrade due to this structural subordination.

On December 3, 2004, Moody’s affirmed our Baa3 long-term debt rating and changed the outlook from negative to stable. On February 24, 2005, Standard &
Poor’s revised our outlook to stable from negative and affirmed its BBB long-term debt rating.

We believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure or cost of debt. A credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an
obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a specific financial program. The credit rating takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other forms of credit
enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated. On the other hand, the ratings outlook highlights the potential direction of a short or long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable events and
short-term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective Rating Agencies. A change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable. As a result, the changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate
impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt.

We issue short-term
commercial paper notes which are currently not rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s. Even though our short-term commercial paper is unrated, we believe a downgrade in our long-term debt rating could have a negative impact on our
ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper.

We do not expect that a
one rating downgrade of our long-term debt by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the long term debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions, the amount, timing and
pricing of new borrowings could be adversely affected. If both of our long-term debt ratings were downgraded to below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced. In the event of a downgrade of our long-term
debt rating, the cost of borrowing and fees payable under our Credit Facility and $35 million private placement fixed rate note could increase. While the Credit Facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit ratings, we do not have any
agreements under which the obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade.

As of December 31, 2004, our capital structure consisted of $736.1 million in total indebtedness and $1,447.8 million in shareholders’ equity. The ratio of debt-to-total capital at December 31, 2004 was 33.7
percent, compared with 39.0 percent at December 31, 2003. Our targeted debt-to-total capital ratio is 40 percent or less.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to
shareholders. In order to meet these cash requirements, we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities.



Dividends paid in 2004 were $43.1 million, compared with $40.5 million in 2003 and $36.4 million in 2002. We anticipate
continuing the practice of paying dividends on a quarterly basis.

The
following summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity:

In addition to the summary of
significant contractual obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2004, variable interest rate debt was $338.6 million at a weighted average interest rate of 3.6%.

A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is
enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases, but represent those purchases for which we are contractually obligated. As of
December 31, 2004, we did not have any purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of $1 million or greater per year.

We expect to make contributions in the range of $5 million to $10 million to our pension plans in 2005.

Other financial measures

In
addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash flows, we also measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income. Free
cash flow and conversion of net income are non-GAAP financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion of net income. We
believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are important measures of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt. In
addition, free cash flow and conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
other companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from continuing and discontinued operating activities:

In 2005, we expect free cash flow to
approximate $200 million.



Off-balance sheet arrangements

At December 31, 2004, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of
environmental cleanups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of
the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations.
We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities. We
settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate.

In
addition, there are pending environmental issues at a limited number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999, that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site. We have established what we
believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When it has been possible to provide
reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our reserves for such
environmental liabilities were approximately $9.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, measured on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual
environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Stand-by letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly for contracts and bids involving
municipal pump products, we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog. In addition,
we issue financial stand-by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled $64.9 million, of which
$38.9 million is a stand-by letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal matter. All fees and expenses are reimbursed by the indemnifying party. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled $35.0 million.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information
pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in ITEM 8, Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by
management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing
contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:

Ÿ

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

Ÿ

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment of Goodwill

The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market comparable, and market capitalization approaches. The
test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. If these estimates change, we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed
our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and
equipment, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or
asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference
between estimated fair value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment
requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates,
rate of increase in future compensation levels, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these assumptions will affect pension
expense.

Discount rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our December 31 measurement
date. The discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions. This produced a discount rate of
5.75 percent in 2004 and 6.25 percent in 2003 and 2002. There are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2005.



Expected rate of return

The expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable year-to-year variance from actual returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we considered our
historical ten-year compounded annual return of 10.5 percent, with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader longer-term market indices. In 2004, the pension plan assets
yielded a positive return of 17.6 percent, compared to positive returns of 24.8 percent in 2003 and a negative return of 10.5 percent in 2002. Our expected rate of return in 2004 equaled 8.5 percent, which remained unchanged from 2003 and 2002. In
2004, the significant difference between our expected return on plan assets of $28.0 million compared to our actual return on plan assets of $53.7 million was primarily due to the continued resurgence of the financial markets, plus the return on
Pentair common stock. There are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2005.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation
recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the
actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year-period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension-related adjustments to equity

In 2002, our discount rate was lowered from 7.25 percent to 6.25 percent and we realized a negative 10.5 percent return on plan assets which caused the accumulated
benefit obligation to exceed the fair market value of plan assets as of December 31, 2002. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid asset, was the primary cause of a $29.2 million net-of-tax charge to
shareholders’ equity for 2002. The recovery of the financial markets in 2003 and positive return on plan assets of 24.8 percent eliminated $20.9 million of the charge to shareholders’ equity. The charge did not impact earnings. In 2004,
our discount rate was lowered from 6.25 percent to 5.75 percent. However, the change in the discount rate assumption was offset by higher than anticipated returns on assets and thus, did not significantly affect our shareholders’ equity.

Net periodic benefit cost

Total net periodic pension benefit cost was $19.2 million in 2004, $15.7 million in 2003, and $12.6 million in 2002. Total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected
to be approximately $19.1 million in 2005, excluding settlement charges related to the Tools Group divestiture. The increasing trend in net periodic pension cost from 2002 forward is largely driven by the decrease in the discount rate in 2004 and
2002 offset by actual returns on plan assets. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2005 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 5.75 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.

Unrecognized pension losses

As of our December 31, 2004 measurement date, our pension plans have $76.7 million of cumulative unrecognized losses of which approximately $7.0 million relates to the
use of the market-related value method and is not immediately subject to amortization. The remaining unrecognized loss, to the extent it exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, will be amortized into expense each year on a straight-line
basis over the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active participants (currently approximating 12 years). The amount included in pension expense for loss amortization in 2004 was $0.5 million.

See ITEM 8, Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information
regarding pension plans.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market Risk

Market risk is the potential economic loss that
may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the
impact of some of these risks. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. The major accounting policies
and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps, and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The
net market value of these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial instrument position. As of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the net financial instrument position was a liability of $766.5 million and $839.4
million, respectively. The decrease in the net financial instrument position was due primarily to the pay down of fixed rate debt in 2004.

We have changed the format of our market risk disclosure to more definitively illustrate the sensitivity of the company’s financial instruments to selected changes
in interest rates.

Interest rate risk

Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of December 31, 2004, was primarily comprised of debt predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars (99%). This debt
portfolio is composed of 43% fixed-rate debt and 57% variable-rate debt, considering the effects of our interest rate swaps. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed-and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in
interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the
interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, as of December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates
would result in a $4.2 million increase or decrease in interest incurred per year, respectively.

Foreign currency risk

We held immaterial positions in foreign exchange-forward contracts as of December 31,
2004.



ITEM 8.    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance
regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of
any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies
or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated
Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2004, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective
based on those criteria. Management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at WICOR, Inc. which was acquired on July 31, 2004, and whose financial statements reflect total assets and total revenues
constituting 37 and 13 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on management’s assessment of the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting for December 31, 2004. That attestation report is set forth immediately following the report of Deloitte & Touche LLP on the financial statements included herein.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pentair, Inc. and
subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004. Our
audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at ITEM 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on
the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pentair, Inc. and
subsidiaries at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial
reporting and an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s
Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, that Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in

Internal
Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As described in Management’s Report on Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting, management excluded from their assessment
the internal control over financial reporting at WICOR, Inc. which was acquired on July 31, 2004 and whose financial statements reflect total assets and revenues constituting 37 and 13 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at WICOR, Inc. The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective
internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under
the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company’s board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting
includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations
of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control
over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the criteria established in

Internal
Control —Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.



We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States),
the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at ITEM 15 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2004 of the Company and our report dated March 10, 2005 expressed an unqualified opinion on those
financial statements and financial statement schedule.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on
December 31. We report our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of
Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and non-U.S., that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting stock or have the ability to exercise
significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, as a result, our share of the earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in the statement of
income. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which Pentair has less than a 20 percent ownership interest and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are carried at cost and are adjusted
only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value.

On May 17, 2004, our
Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend payable on June 8, 2004, to shareholders of record as of June 1, 2004. All share and per share information presented in this Form 10-K has been
retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this stock split.

Effective
after the close of business October 2, 2004, we completed the sale of the Tools Group to The Black & Decker Corporation. Our consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the Tools Group as a discontinued operation for all
periods presented.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty
involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policies that require our most significant estimates and judgments include:

Ÿ

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including goodwill; and

Ÿ

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery
has occurred (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold other than warranty obligations in the normal, ordinary course of business. In the event significant
post-shipment obligations were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Sales returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly
with our customers. Revenue from a transaction is recognized only if our price is fixed and determinable at the date of sale; the customer has paid or is obligated to



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

pay; the customer’s obligation would not be changed in the event of theft or physical destruction or damage of the product, the customer has economic
substance apart from our Company; we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the customer; and the amount of returns can reasonably be estimated.

In general, our return policy allows for customer returns only upon our authorization. Goods
returned must be product we continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of custom or modified goods are normally not allowed.

At the time of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect of returns. Estimated sales returns include consideration of historical sales levels, the timing and
magnitude of historical sales return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type of customer, and a projection of this experience into the future.

Pricing and sales incentives

We record estimated reductions to
revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions, and other volume-based incentives at the later of the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered. Sales incentives given to our customers
are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable benefit for the goods or services in exchange for the consideration and (2) we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received. The following represents a
description of our pricing arrangements, promotions, and other volume-based incentives:

Pricing arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers and we record sales at the
agreed upon net selling price. However, one of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a percentage of the original purchase price if they can demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM customer. At the time of sale, we estimate the
anticipated refund to be paid based on historical experience and reduce sales for the probable cost of the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as cooperative advertising. Under this cooperative advertising program, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of sales as an allowance to be used to advertise and promote our
products. The customer is not required to provide evidence of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the cost of this cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The cost of this program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer achieves a specified cumulative
level of sales. Under these incentive programs, at the time of sale, we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least monthly, for each customer and sales are reduced for the
anticipated cost of the rebate. If the forecasted sales for a customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

There have been no material accounting revisions for revenue-recognition related estimates.

Shipping and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recorded in

net sales

in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling costs
incurred by Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

cost of goods sold

in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Cash equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record
an allowance for doubtful accounts, reducing our receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience, current
trends, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic credit evaluations of our customer’s financial condition. We generally do not require collateral. No customer receivable balances exceeded 10 percent of total net receivable balances as of
December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

In December 2004, we entered into a
one-year Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement whereby designated customer accounts receivable may be sold without recourse to a third-party financial institution on a revolving basis. These receivables consist of specific invoices that are
assigned and subject to a filed security interest. We act as the agent for the third-party, providing collections and claims services. Following the initial settlement period, we are required to transfer payments, make adjustment to invoice amounts
and pay interest (at LIBOR plus 1.05%) on the assigned receivables to the third-party on a monthly basis. We are also required to maintain trade credit insurance on the sold receivables. Receivable sales can occur on the settlement date or as the
third-party permits, up to a maximum total outstanding amount of $30 million, with the ability to make additional sales as sold receivables are repaid.

As of December 31, 2004, we have sold an approximate $22.0 million interest in our pool of accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution to mitigate the
credit risk associated with the receivable balance of a large customer. In compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

,
sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. As the
estimated present value of the receivables sold approximated the carrying amount, no gain or loss was recorded in 2004.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the
lower of cost or market. Inventories of United States subsidiaries are generally determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventories of foreign-based subsidiaries are determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) and moving average
methods.

Property, plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at historical cost. We compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements that add to
productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We
review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected
future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and
carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash
flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Goodwill and identifiable
intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and
identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on
an annual basis. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

The primary identifiable intangible assets of Pentair include trade marks and trade names, brand names, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technology and
customer relationships. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to
amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more
frequently if events warrant. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. During the fourth quarter of 2004, we completed our annual impairment test for those identifiable assets
not subject to amortization and determined there was no impairment.

Cost
and equity method investments

We have investments that are accounted for at historical cost or, if we have significant influence over the investee,
using the equity method. Pentair’s proportionate share of income or losses from investments accounted for under the equity method is recorded in the consolidated statements of income. We write down or write off an investment and recognize a
loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the investees’ financial condition, and in certain cases the possibility
of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the investees’ historical results of operations, and projected results and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from projections, we may incur future
charges for the impairment of these investments.

Income taxes

Pentair uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized
for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect
on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change.

Environmental

In accordance with SOP 96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

, we recognize environmental cleanup liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not
subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental cleanup is estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) will be able
to fulfill their commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and severally liable. The process of estimating environmental cleanup liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and
physical data relating to a contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multi-party sites. In future
periods, new laws or regulations, advances in cleanup technologies, and additional information about the ultimate cleanup remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in other
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance subsidiary

We insure general and product liability, property, workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks through our wholly- owned captive
insurance subsidiary. Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. As December 31 2004 and 2003, reserves for policy claims were $38.8 million ($10.0 million included in

accrued product claims and
warranties

and $28.8 million included in

other noncurrent liabilities

) and $32.4 million ($10.0 million included in

accrued product claims and warranties

and $22.4 million included in

other noncurrent liabilities

),
respectively.

Stock-based compensation

Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based

Compensation

, we apply the recognition and measurement
principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

, to our stock options and other stock-based compensation plans.

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, cost for stock-based compensation is recognized in income based on the excess, if any, of the quoted
market price of the stock at the grant date of the award or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The exercise price for stock options granted to employees equals the fair market value of Pentair’s
common stock at the date of grant, thereby resulting in no recognition of compensation expense by Pentair. However, from time to time, we have elected to modify the terms of the original grant. Those modified grants have been accounted for as a new
award and measured using the intrinsic value method under APB Opinion No. 25, resulting in the inclusion of compensation expense in our consolidated statement of income. Restricted stock awards are recorded as compensation cost over the requisite
vesting periods based on the market value on the date of grant. Unearned compensation cost on restricted stock awards is shown as a reduction to shareholders’ equity.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The following table illustrates the effect on income and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value
recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation. The estimated fair value of each Pentair option is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

Earnings per common
share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock. Unless otherwise noted, references are to
diluted earnings per share.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated using the following:

Derivative financial instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our balance sheet. If
the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow hedge, changes in the fair value of
the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge becomes
ineffective, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. For a derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are reported in
earnings immediately.

We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations. All hedging instruments are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, as amended. We do not hold or issue
derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All other contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also meet the requirements of, and have been designated as, normal purchases or sales. Our
policy is not to enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Foreign currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the United States are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates
of exchange at the balance sheet date. The resultant translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates
of exchange.

Other newly adopted accounting standards

In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) revised SFAS No. 132,

Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions
and Other Post-retirement Benefits

. The revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those required by the original standard about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and
other defined benefit post-retirement plans. As revised, SFAS No. 132 is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2003. The interim-period disclosures required by this standard are effective for interim periods
beginning after December 15, 2003. However, disclosure of the estimated future benefit payments is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004. See ITEM 8, Note 11 for disclosures regarding our defined benefit pension plans and other
post-retirement benefits.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE), an Interpretation of ARB No. 51

, which requires all VIEs to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that holds the majority of the beneficial
interests in the VIE. In December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46, delaying the effective dates for certain entities created before February 1, 2003, and making other amendments to clarify application of the guidance. For potential variable interest
entities other than any Special Purpose Entities (SPEs), the revised FIN 46 (FIN 46R) is now required to be applied no later than the end of the first fiscal year or interim reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. The original guidance under
FIN 46 is still applicable, however, for all SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003 at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. FIN 46 may be applied prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment as
of the date it is first applied, or by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. FIN 46R also requires certain disclosures of an entity’s relationship
with variable interest entities. We adopted FIN 46R for non-SPE entities in our first quarter ended April 3, 2004 which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (“FSP”) 106-2,

Accounting and
Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003

, which supercedes FSP 106-1 of the same title issued in January 2004. FSP 106-2 becomes effective for the first interim or annual period
beginning after June 15, 2004. FSP 106-2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) for employers that sponsor postretirement health care
plans that provide prescription drug benefits. FSP 106-2 also requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Act. Since our postretirement health care plan is a fully insured plan
and is not eligible to receive the federal subsidy, the adoption of FSP 106-2 did not have any effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on the remaining portions of EITF 03-01,

The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary
Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments

, with an effective date of June 15, 2004. EITF 03-01 provides new disclosure requirements for other-than-temporary impairments on debt and equity investments. Investors are required to
disclose quantitative information about: (i) the aggregate amount of unrealized losses, and (ii) the aggregate related fair values of investments with unrealized losses, segregated into time periods during which the investment has been in an



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

unrealized loss position of less than 12 months and greater than 12 months. In addition, investors are required to disclose the qualitative information that
supports their conclusion that the impairments noted in the qualitative disclosure are not other-than-temporary. In September 2004, the FASB approved FSP EITF 03-1, which defers the effective date for recognition and measurement guidance contained
in EITF 03-1 until certain issues are resolved. The adoption of this EITF is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.

On October 22, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109,

Accounting for Income
Taxes

, for the Tax Deduction Provided to U.S. Based Manufacturers by the American Job Creation Act of 2004, and FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provisions within the American Jobs Creation Act
of 2004.

FSP No. 109-1 clarifies how to apply SFAS No. 109 to the new
law’s tax deduction for income attributable to “domestic production activities.” The fully phased-in deduction is up to nine percent of the lesser of taxable income or “qualified production activities income.” The staff
proposal would require that the deduction be accounted for as a special deduction in the period earned, not as a tax-rate reduction.

FSP No. 109-2, provides guidance under SFAS No. 109 with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of
2004 (the “Jobs Act”) on enterprises’ income tax expense and deferred tax liability FSP 109-2 states that an enterprise is permitted time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its
plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. During the fourth quarter, we repatriated approximately $70.0 million in extraordinary dividends, as defined in the Jobs Act, consisting primarily of
foreign proceeds resulting from the sale of the Tools Group. We elected to apply the provisions of Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted as part of the Jobs Act, to the repatriated extraordinary dividends and therefore, were eligible to
claim an eighty-five percent dividends received deduction for income tax purposes on the eligible amounts. The net tax cost of the repatriation of the extraordinary dividends, recorded in discontinued operations, was approximately $4.0 million.

New accounting standards to be adopted in the future

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004),

Share-Based Payment

, which replaces SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation

, and supercedes APB Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees

. SFAS No. 123R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the financial
statements based on their fair values beginning with the first interim or annual period after June 15, 2005, with early adoption encouraged. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS No. 123 no longer will be an alternative to
financial statement recognition. Under SFAS No. 123R, we must determine the appropriate fair value model to be used for valuing share-based payments, the amortization method for compensation cost and the transition method to be used at date of
adoption. SFAS No. 123R permits a prospective or two modified versions of retrospective application under which financial statements for prior periods are adjusted on a basis consistent with the pro forma disclosures required for those periods by
the original SFAS No. 123. We are required to adopt SFAS No. 123R in the third quarter of fiscal 2005, at which time we will begin recognizing an expense for unvested share-based compensation that has been issued or will be issued after that date.
Under the retroactive options, prior periods may be restated either as of the beginning of the year of adoption, January 1, 2005, or for all periods presented. We have not yet finalized our decision concerning the transition option we will utilize
to adopt SFAS No. 123R. We are evaluating the requirements of SFAS No. 123R and expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 123R will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and earnings per share. We have not determined whether
the adoption will result in amounts that are similar to the current pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs—An Amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4

.
SFAS No. 151 amends the guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage). Among other provisions, the
new rule requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be recognized as current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of “so abnormal” as stated in ARB
No. 43. Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15,
2005 and is required to be adopted by us on January 1, 2006. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect SFAS No. 151 to have
a material impact.

In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets—An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

. SFAS No. 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in
paragraph 21(b) of APB Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions

, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance
if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS No. 153 is effective for the fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of
fiscal 2006. We are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of SFAS No. 153 will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition but do not expect it to have a material impact.

2.

Acquisitions

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of WICOR, Inc. (“WICOR”) from Wisconsin Energy Corporation (“WEC”) for $889.6 million, including a third quarter
cash payment of $871.1 million, cash acquired of $15.5 million, transaction costs of $5.8 million, plus debt assumed of $21.6 million. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we received a $14.0 million final purchase price adjustment, a $0.3 million
decrease in cash acquired, and recorded an additional $5.1 million in transaction costs. WICOR manufactures water system, filtration and pool equipment products primarily under the STA-RITE

®

, SHURflo

®

and Hypro

®

brands. We funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR acquisition with an $850 million committed line of
credit (the “Bridge Facility”) and through additional borrowings available under our existing credit facility.

Preliminary valuations of identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $182.0 million, including $102.5 million of definite-lived intangible
assets, including patented and proprietary technology of $39.6 million with a weighted average amortization period of 14.2 years and customer relationships of $62.9 million with a weighted average amortization period of 18.0 years. We ascribed a
useful life of 14.2 years to patented and proprietary technology based on an analysis of the legal and contractual provisions. In addition, we ascribed a useful life of 18.0 years to customer relationships based on an analysis of customer attrition
rates, the stability of product technology, and the value of proven customer service in retaining long standing customers. Due to a relatively flat forecasted attrition pattern, we will amortize the customer relationship balance on a straight-line
basis over its estimated useful life.

Goodwill recorded as part of the initial
purchase price allocation in the third quarter was $600.5 million, of which approximately $70.6 million is tax deductible. During the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2004, goodwill recorded as part of the initial purchase price allocation was
adjusted to $588.4 million, of which $70.6 million is tax deductible. The $12.1 million decrease in goodwill was primarily due to the receipt of the final purchase price adjustment of $14.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. We continue to
evaluate the purchase price allocation for the WICOR acquisition, including intangible assets, contingent liabilities, plant rationalization costs, and property, plant and equipment. We expect to revise it as better information becomes available in
2005.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

On December 31, 2003, we acquired all of the common stock of Everpure, Inc. (“Everpure”) from United States
Filter Corporation, a unit of Veolia Environnement, for $217.3 million in cash, including cash acquired of $5.5 million and transaction costs of $2.2 million. Everpure is a leading global provider of water filtration products for the commercial and
consumer sectors. Everpure products include a wide array of filtration systems and cartridges for various applications. Preliminary valuations of identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $91.1 million, including $49.3
million of definite-lived intangible assets with a weighted average amortization period of 16.0 years. Goodwill recorded as part of the initial purchase price allocation was $105.3 million, of which approximately $104.0 million is tax deductible.
During the year ended December 31, 2004, goodwill was adjusted to $129.6 million, of which approximately $102.5 million is tax deductible. The $24.3 million increase in goodwill is primarily due to a $16.6 million decrease in amortizable intangible
assets following the determination of the final valuation of intangible assets and the payment of a final purchase price adjustment of $3.9 million in the second quarter of 2004. The purchase price allocation for the Everpure acquisition has been
completed.

During the year ended December 31, 2003, we also completed four
product line acquisitions in our Water segment for total consideration of approximately $21.4 million in cash including transaction costs: Hydrotemp Manufacturing Co., Inc., Letro Products, Inc. and certain assets of TwinPumps, Inc. and K&M
Plastics, Inc. The allocation of the purchase price of these four product line acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $18.8 million, all of which is tax deductible. The purchase price allocations for the four product line acquisitions have been
completed with no material effect on previously recorded estimates.

The
following pro forma consolidated condensed financial results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2004, and 2003 are presented as if the acquisitions had been completed at the beginning of each period presented.

These pro forma consolidated condensed
financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments, such as increased interest expense on acquisition debt. The adjustments do not reflect the effect of synergies that would have been expected to
result from the integration of these acquisitions. The pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the combination occurred on January 1 of each year presented, or of
future results of the consolidated entities.

3.

Discontinued Operations/Divestitures

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we completed the sale of our Tools Group to The Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”) for approximately
$796.8 million in cash, including a $21.8 million interim net asset value increase, subject to post-closing adjustments. We used the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

borrowings under our credit facility to repay the $850 million Bridge Facility, used to acquire WICOR, on October 4, 2004. We retained certain insurance
liabilities, employee compensation and benefit liabilities, environmental liabilities, pension obligations and post-retirement obligations of the Tools Group. In the fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a loss on the disposal of the Tools Group for
$6.0 million, net of a tax provision of $9.0 million.

In 2001, we completed
the sale of the Service Equipment businesses (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) to Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of $18.2 million and we completed the sale of Lincoln Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC
(Jordan), other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial for total consideration of $78.4 million, including a preferred stock interest. In January 2003, we paid $2.4 million for a final adjustment to the selling price related to
the disposition of Lincoln Industrial, which was offset by a previously established reserve. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million primarily due to a reduction in estimated
proceeds related to exiting two remaining facilities.

Operating results of the
discontinued operations are summarized below. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead previously allocated to the Tools Group. The amounts include an allocation of interest based on a ratio of the net assets of the discontinued operations to
the total net assets of Pentair.

At December 31, 2004, the liabilities
totaling $3.2 million represent the estimated future cash outflows associated with the exit from a leased facility.

Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets

The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the year ended December 31, 2004 by segment is as follows:

The detail of acquired intangible
assets consisted of the following:

Intangible asset amortization expense
in 2004, 2003, and 2002 was $7.5 million, $1.5 million, and $0.7 million, respectively. The increase in amortization expense between 2004 and 2003 was the result of the WICOR acquisition. In the third quarter of 2004, we recorded $102.5 million of
definite-lived intangible assets, including patented and proprietary technology of $39.6 million with a weighted average amortization period of 14.2 years and customer relationships of $62.9 million with a weighted average amortization period of
18.0 years.

The estimated future amortization expense for identifiable
intangible assets during the next five years is as follows:

Supplemental Balance Sheet Information

In 2004, the minimum pension liability
adjustment remained relatively consistent compared to the prior year despite the 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 5.75 percent as of December 31, 2004 as it was offset by our pension plan asset performance. In 2002, the significant
increase in the minimum pension liability



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

adjustment was primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate and lower than expected pension plan asset performance. The net foreign currency
translation gain in 2004 and 2003 of $25.4 million and $27.2 million, respectively, was primarily the result of the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and Canadian dollar currencies. Changes in the market value of derivative
financial instruments was impacted primarily by the maturities of derivatives and changing interest rates. Fluctuations in the value of hedging instruments are generally offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying exposures being hedged.

8.    Debt

Long-term debt and the average interest rate on debt outstanding as of December 31 is
summarized as follows:

As of December 31, 2004, we had a $500
million multi-currency revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with various banks expiring on July 25, 2006. On March 4, 2005, we amended and restated our multi-currency revolving Credit Facility, increasing the size of the
facility from $500 million to $800 million with a term of five years. The interest rate on the loans under the $800 million Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to the extent
availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2004, we had $178.0 million of commercial paper outstanding that matured within 44
days. All of the commercial paper was classified as long-term as we have the intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility. Availability under our Credit Facility at December 31, 2004, including
outstanding commercial paper, was approximately $268.0 million.

Effective
following the close of business on July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of WICOR. We funded the payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR acquisition with an $850 million committed line of credit (the
“Bridge Facility”) and through additional borrowings available under our existing Credit Facility. The interest rate on the Bridge Facility and loans under the Credit Facility during the period of the Bridge Facility was LIBOR plus 1.375%.

On October 4, 2004, we received approximately $796.8 million of proceeds from
the sale of our Tools Group to BDK. As required under the terms of the Bridge Facility, we used the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

additional borrowings under the Credit Facility to pay off the Bridge Facility. Following payment of the Bridge Facility and based on our existing credit
ratings, the interest rate on loans under the Credit Facility decreased to LIBOR plus 1.125%.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2004.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $25 million of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had no borrowings as of December 31, 2004.

Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2004, matures on a calendar year basis by contractual debt maturity as follows:

9.    Derivative and Financial Instruments

Cash-flow hedges

We have an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to exchange variable rate interest
payment obligations for fixed rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. As of December 31, 2004, we had a variable to fixed rate swap agreement outstanding with an aggregate
notional amount of $20.0 million expiring in June 2005. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 6.31 percent. The fair value of this swap was a liability of $0.4 million at December 31, 2004.

The variable to fixed interest rate swap is designated as and is effective as a cash-flow
hedge. The fair value of this swap is recorded on the balance sheet, with changes in fair values included in other comprehensive income (OCI). Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the related
interest expense is recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs. We estimate $0.4 million of net derivative losses will be reclassified into earnings in 2005. No hedging relationships were de-designated during 2004.

Fair value hedge

In March 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert interest rate expense on $100 million of Senior notes for the term of the notes (maturing October 2009) from a 7.85 percent fixed
annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 2.49 percent. This swap agreement was designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge. In September 2002, we terminated this swap agreement and received $8.2 million.
This amount, net of accumulated amortization, is recorded as a premium to the carrying amount of the notes in the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the Senior notes. The
$8.2 million was illustrated in the 2002 consolidated statement of cash flows as an increase in

other assets and liabilities

.

Concurrent with the termination of the interest rate swap, we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert $100 million of Senior notes for the
term of the notes (maturing October 2009) from a 7.85 percent fixed annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 3.69 percent. The fair value of the swap was a liability of $0.5 million at December 31, 2004. This swap
agreement has been designated



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

and accounted for as a fair value hedge. Since this swap qualifies for the short-cut method under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of the swap
(included in

other long-term liabilities

in the consolidated balance sheets) are offset by changes in the fair value of the designated debt being hedged. Consequently, there is no impact on net income or shareholders’ equity.

Fair value of financial instruments

The recorded amounts and estimated fair values of long-term debt, excluding the effects of derivative financial instruments, and the recorded amounts and estimated
fair value of those derivative financial instruments were as follows:

The following methods were used to
estimate the fair values of each class of financial instrument:

Ÿ

short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable, and short-term borrowings) — recorded amount
approximates fair value because of the short maturity period;

Ÿ

long-term debt, including current maturities — fair value is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt with similar terms; and

Ÿ

interest rate swap agreements — fair value is based on market or dealer quotes.

10.    Income Taxes

Income from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The provision for income taxes for continuing operations consisted of the following:

Deferred taxes arise because of
different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets” (generally items that can be used
as a tax deduction or credit in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities” (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the tax impact has not yet been recorded in the consolidated statements of income).

We recorded an income tax provision relating to discontinued operations of $34.0 million,
$28.7 million, and $34.7 million during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The effective tax rate of the discontinued operations differs from the statutory rate due primarily to state and foreign taxes. The tax provision resulting from the
Tools Group sale transaction was $9.0 million. This amount, reflected in the $34.0 million amount above, differs from the statutory rate due primarily to state and foreign taxes which were impacted by the form of the transaction and the geographic
locations of the assets that were sold.

During the fourth quarter, we
repatriated approximately $70.0 million in extraordinary dividends, as defined in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”), consisting primarily of foreign proceeds resulting from the sale of the Tools Group. We elected to
apply the provisions of Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted as part of the Jobs Act, to the repatriated extraordinary dividends and therefore, were eligible to claim an eighty-five percent dividends received deduction for income tax
purposes on the eligible amounts. The net tax cost of the repatriation of the extraordinary dividends, recorded in discontinued operations, was approximately $4.0 million.

United States income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our intention to reinvest
these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

do so. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $80.0 million of unremitted earnings attributable to international subsidiaries were considered to be
indefinitely invested. We believe that any U.S. tax on repatriated earnings would be substantially offset by U.S. foreign tax credits.

The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The determination of annual income tax
expense takes into consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examined our U.S. federal income tax returns through 1997 with no material adjustments and is currently
auditing 1998 to 2001. We do not expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years; however, actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.

Non-U.S. tax losses of $5.3 million and $11.0 million were available for carryforward at
December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. A valuation allowance of $1.6 million and `$1.5 million exists for deferred income tax benefits related to the loss carryforwards available that may not be realized as of December 31, 2004 and
2003, respectively. We believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective countries to allow us to fully recover the remainder of the tax losses. A majority of our non-U.S. tax losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The
remaining non-U.S. tax losses will begin to expire in 2007.

11.    Benefit Plans

Pension and
post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based
principally on an employee’s years of service and/or compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life
insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a December 31 measurement date.

The acquisition of WICOR increased unfunded pension liabilities by approximately $23.7 million and increased post-retirement liabilities by approximately $32.1 million. Corresponding liabilities equal to the unfunded
liabilities were recorded on WICOR’s opening balance sheet. Annual pension and post-retirement expense for the WICOR plans is expected to be approximately $6.0 million.

The sale of our Tools Group decreased unfunded pension liabilities by approximately $2.5 million and decreased post-retirement liabilities
by approximately $4.8 million. The divestiture will eventually result in a reduction in plan liabilities of approximately $34.0 million offset by a corresponding transfer of plan assets to current plan participants and a BDK pension trust, of which
approximately $10.0 million has already been paid. The sale of the Tools Group is expected to reduce annual pension expense and post-retirement by about $4.5 million.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

In 2004, under the requirements of SFAS No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of
Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits,

we recognized a curtailment expense and special termination benefits totaling approximately $1.8 million due to the divestiture of the Tools Group. In 2005, we expect to recognize an
additional settlement expense of approximately $5.0 million as the benefits are paid to former plan participants of the Tools Group.

Obligations and Funded Status

The following tables present reconciliations of the benefit obligation of the plans, the plan assets of the pension plans, and the funded status of the plans:

Of the $163.8 million underfunding at
December 31, 2004, $94.5 million relates to foreign pension plans and our supplemental executive retirement plan which are not commonly funded.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of:

The accumulated benefit obligation for
all defined benefit plans was $469.2 million and $363.4 million at December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Information for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation or projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets are as follows:

Components of net periodic benefit
cost are as follows:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31 are as follows:

Weighted-average assumptions used
to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ending December 31 are as follows:

Discount rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our December 31 measurement
date. The discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions. This produced a discount rate of
5.75 percent in 2004 and 6.25 percent in 2003 and 2002. There are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2005.

Expected rate of return

The expected
rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable year-to-year variance from actual returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we considered our historical ten-year
compounded annual return of 10.5 percent, with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader longer-term market indices. In 2004, the pension plan assets yielded a positive
return of 17.6 percent, compared to positive returns of 24.8 percent in 2003 and a negative return of 10.5 percent in 2002. Our expected rate of return in 2004 equaled 8.5 percent, which remained unchanged from 2003 and 2002. In 2004, the
significant difference between our expected return on plan assets of $28.0 million compared to our actual return on plan assets of $53.7 million was primarily due to the continued resurgence of the financial markets, plus the return on Pentair
common stock. There are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2005.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation
recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the
actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year-period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension-related adjustments to equity

In 2002, our discount rate was lowered from 7.25 percent to 6.25 percent and we realized a negative 10.5 percent return on plan assets which caused the accumulated
benefit obligation to exceed the fair market value of plan assets as of December 31, 2002. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid asset,



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

was the primary cause of a $29.2 million net-of-tax charge to shareholders’ equity for 2002. The recovery of the financial markets in 2003 and positive
return on plan assets of 24.8 percent eliminated $20.9 million of the charge to shareholders’ equity. In 2004, our discount rate was lowered from 6.25 percent to 5.75 percent. However, the change in the discount rate assumption was offset by
higher than anticipated returns on assets and thus, did not significantly affect our shareholders’ equity.

Net periodic benefit cost

Total net periodic pension benefit cost was
$19.2 million in 2004, $15.7 million in 2003, and $12.6 million in 2002. Total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected to be approximately $19.1 million in 2005, excluding settlement charges related to the Tools Group divestiture. The
increasing trend in net periodic pension cost from 2002 forward is largely driven by the decrease in the discount rate in 2004 and 2002 offset by actual returns on plan assets. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2005 has been estimated
assuming a discount rate of 5.75 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.

Unrecognized pension losses

As of our December 31, 2004 measurement date, our pension plans have $76.7 million of
cumulative unrecognized losses of which approximately $7.0 million relates to the use of the market-related value method and is not immediately subject to amortization. The remaining unrecognized loss, to the extent it exceeds 10% of the projected
benefit obligation, will be amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active participants (currently approximating 12 years). The amount included in pension expense for loss
amortization in 2004 was $0.5 million.

The assumed health care cost trend
rates at December 31 are as follows:

Plan Assets

Objective

The primary objective of our pension plans is to meet commitments to our employees at a reasonable cost to the company. This is primarily accomplished through growth of capital and safety of the funds invested. The
plans will therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital over inflation through appreciation of securities held and through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and interest income.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Asset allocation

Our actual overall asset allocation for the plans as compared to our investment policy goals is as follows:

(1)

Actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

We regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. From time to time, we may be
outside our targeted ranges by amounts we deem acceptable

Our cash balance is
higher than normal due to the liquidation of the WICOR pension assets held in a separate trust as of December 31, 2004. Those funds were transferred to our pension master trust and subsequent to December 31, 2004, a portion was reinvested in
accordance with our targeted asset allocations. We plan on transferring most of the remaining cash balance to BDK in conjunction with our transfer of certain pension benefit obligations related to the divested Tools Group. We do require a cash
balance to be available to fund monthly benefit payments and administrative fees.

Equity securities include Pentair common stock in the amount of $41.1 million and $21.6 million at December 31, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Our investment in Pentair common stock is outside of the targeted range due to the significant
increase in the fair value of Pentair stock in 2004.

Cash Flows

Contributions

In 2004, pension contributions totaled $7.2 million, including $2.7 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans. In 2003, pension contributions
totaled $19.1 million, including $15.1 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans. The contributions in 2004 and 2003 equaled or exceeded the minimum funding requirement. Our 2005 pension contributions are expected to be in
the range of $5 million to $10 million.

Estimated Future Benefit Payments

The following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid by the plans as follows:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Savings plan

We have a 401(k) plan (the plan) with an employee stock ownership (ESOP) bonus component, which covers certain union and nearly all-nonunion U.S. employees who meet certain age requirements. Under the plan, eligible U.S. employees may
voluntarily contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation. Matching contributions are made in cash to employees who meet certain eligibility and service requirements. Our matching contribution is based on our financial performance and
ranges from 30 percent to 90 percent of eligible employee contributions, limited to 4 percent of compensation contributed by employees.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP contribution equal to 1.5 percent of annual
eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the 401(k) and ESOP were
approximately $10.7 million, $7.3 million, and $4.9 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

12.    Shareholders’ Equity

Authorized shares

We may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our Board of Directors may designate
up to 15 million of those shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock of up to 2.5 million shares, Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share. No
shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2004.

Purchase rights

On December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
“Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock. The dividend was payable upon the close of business on January 28, 2005 to the shareholders of record upon the close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right entitles the registered
holder to purchase one one-hundreth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a price of $240.00 per one one-hundreth of a share, subject to adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless certain change in control
events occur, such as a person acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. The description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated December 10,
2004. The Rights will expire on January 28, 2015, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement. On January 28, 2005, the common share purchase rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement
dated July 31, 1995 were redeemed in their entirety for an amount equal to $0.0025 per right.

Share repurchases

In December 2003, the Board of Directors authorized the development of a program and
process to annually purchase up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock, on a post stock-split basis, in open market or negotiated transactions to partially offset dilution due to normal grants of restricted shares and options to employees. In 2004,
2003 and 2002, respectively, we repurchased 105,500 shares, 80,000 shares and 0 shares of our common stock under similar plans.

In December 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the development of a program and process to annually repurchase shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar
limit of $25 million. There is no expiration associated with the authorization granted. As of February 18, 2005, no shares have been repurchased and accordingly, we have the authority to repurchase shares up to a maximum dollar limit of $25 million.

13.    Stock Plans

Omnibus stock incentive plan

In
April 2004, the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended and Restated (the Plan) was approved by shareholders. The Plan authorizes the issuance of additional shares of our common stock and extends through April 2014. The Plan allows for the granting
of:

The Plan is administered by our
Compensation Committee (the Committee), which is made up of independent members of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards under the Plan are managerial, administrative, or other key employees who are in a position to make a
material contribution to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards, establish certain terms and conditions of award
grants, and take certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan provides that no more than 20 percent of the total shares available for issuance under the Plan may be used to make awards other than stock options and limits the
Committee’s authority to reprice awards or to cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

Incentive stock options

Under the Plan we may grant stock options to any eligible employee
with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date.

Restricted stock, rights to restricted stock and ICUs

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded restricted shares or rights to restricted shares (awards) of our common stock and
ICUs. Restrictions on awards and ICUs generally expire from two to five years after issuance, subject to continuous employment and certain other conditions. Restricted stock awards are recorded at market value on the grant date as unearned
compensation. Unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of shareholders’ equity in our consolidated financial statements and is being amortized to expense over the restriction period. Annual expense for the value of restricted stock and
ICUs was $6.6 million in 2004, $4.6 million in 2003, and $7.9 million in 2002.

Outside directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options are granted to outside directors under the Outside
Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan) with an exercise price equal to 100 percent of the market value of the shares on the option grant dates. Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the first
anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors Plan extends to January 2008.

In 2004, we recorded $4.4 million of compensation expense related to the modification of option terms for employees terminated in association with our Tools Group divestiture.

14.    Business Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following business segments:

Ÿ

Water

— manufactures and markets essential products and systems used in the movement, treatment, storage and enjoyment of water. Water segment products include
water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and pool and spa equipment and accessories.

Ÿ

Enclosures

— designs, manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls components and accessories. Applications
served include industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases,
subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal management systems.

Ÿ

Other

— is primarily composed of unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations, and
intercompany eliminations.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and operating income of the segment and use a variety of ratios to measure performance. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have
occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

Financial information by reportable business segment is included in the following summary:

(1)

All cash and cash equivalents are included in Other.

The following table presents certain geographic information:

Net sales are based on the location in
which the sale originated. Long-lived assets represent property, plant, and equipment, net of related depreciation.

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple markets and customers for which we do not have the financial systems to track revenues by primary product
category. However, our net sales by segment is representative of our sales by major product category.

We sell our products through various distribution channels including wholesale and retail distributors, original equipment manufacturers, and home centers. In our Water segment, one customer accounted for about 11
percent of segment sales in 2004 and 12 percent of segment sales in 2003 and 2002. In our Enclosure segment, no single customer accounted for more than 10 percent of segment sales in 2004, 2003, or 2002.

Commitments and Contingencies

Operating lease commitments

Net rental expense under
operating leases follows:

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental cleanups, in which our
current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of
operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company
ammunition business in 1997, the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for
indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities. We settled one such claim in 2003
and our recorded accrual was adequate.

In addition, there are pending
environmental issues at a limited number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999, that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site. We have established what we believe to be adequate
accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our
liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, our reserves for such environmental liabilities were
approximately $9.4 million and $10.8 million, respectively, measured on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and
liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given
notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes, product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent infringement, and employment matters.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

We comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when determining
whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial
statements, (c) opinions of legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most likely estimate of the loss. When no
amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows from any such
future charges is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse impact. We do and will
continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As a result, the current
estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal Proceedings” could change in the future.

Warranties and guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various potential liabilities relating to the sold
business, such as pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or other obligations. The subject matter, amounts, and duration of any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of liability indemnified and may vary widely
from transaction to transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made
significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45 (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Others

, we recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We have guaranteed the indebtedness of one customer, whose outstanding debt at December 31,
2004 was $1.5 million. The debt amount is a declining balance and scheduled to be paid in full by June 2007. The liability relating to the guarantee is not material.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products. Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a review of historical
warranty and service claim experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience warrant.

The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties for the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 are as follows:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Stand-by letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly for contracts and bids involving municipal pump products, we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non-performance. The
outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance programs and
certain legal matters. As of December 31, 2004, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled $64.9 million, of which $38.9 million is a stand-by letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal matter. All fees and expenses are reimbursed
by the indemnifying party. As of December 31, 2003, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled $35.0 million.
