PART I

Item 1.  Business

(a)  General Development of the Business.

The Registrant was incorporated in 1966 under the laws of Minnesota.
In the past year, the Registrant has not changed its form of organization 
or mode of conducting business.  The Registrant grows through internal
development and acquisitions.  As in the past, periodic dispositions of
assets or business units are possible when they no longer fit with the
long-term strategies of the Registrant.

Effective January 1, 1994, the Registrant acquired the net assets and the 
subsidiaries of Schroff GmbH (Schroff) from Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp 
for a cash purchase price of approximately $140 million net of cash acquired.  
Schroff manufactures and sells enclosures, cases, subracks and accessories 
for commercial electronic and instrumentation applications. 

In September 1994, Pentair announced that it was exploring strategic 
alternatives for its paper businesses,including their possible sale.  
In the second quarter of 1995, all of the Pentair paper businesses were sold. 
On April 1, 1995 the company sold its Cross Pointe Paper Corporation 
subsidiary for $203.3 million to Noranda Forest, Inc.  On June 30, 1995 
the company sold its Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corporation, its 50% 
share of Lake Superior Paper Industries (LSPI) joint venture and its 12% 
share of Superior Recycled Fiber Industries (SRFI) for $115.6 million 
cash to Consolidated Papers, Inc.

The sale transactions have permitted Pentair to focus its commitments 
and resources on the industrial products sector, building upon the 
strong growth and leading market positions these businesses have achieved.  

Effective November 1, 1995, the Company acquired Fleck Controls, Inc., 
a manufacturer of control valves which are major components in 
residential water softeners, and commercial and industrial water
conditioning systems for $133.9 million.  Pentair considers Fleck 
to be its first major step in entering the water treatment business. 
This will be continued as Pentair pursues other product offerings and new
channels within the water products market. 


(b)  Financial Information about Industry Segments.

The Registrant's business is conducted in two industry segments.  
The Specialty Products segment manufactures woodworking machinery; 
portable power tools; valves for water conditioning equipment; and
pumps and pumping systems.  The General Industrial Equipment segment 
manufactures electrical and electronic enclosures and wireways; 
industrial lubricating systems and material dispensing equipment;
automotive service equipment; and sporting ammunition. Business segment 
financial information is found on page 32 and page 54 (Note 16) of the 
1995 Annual Report to Shareholders.


Narrative Description of Business.
  
  Description of the Specialty Products Segment:

    Products and marketing.

The following table sets forth, for each of the last three years, 
the Specialty Products segment product class net sales in 
excess of 10 percent of the Registrant's consolidated net sales .


Woodworking Machinery.  The Registrant, through its subsidiary 
Delta International Machinery Corp.(Delta), manufactures, markets, 
and services a line of general-purpose woodworking machinery, such as
saws, planers, jointers, plate joiners, grinders, drill presses, 
shapers, lathes, and other quality machines. Delta sells its products 
in the United States, Canada, and other foreign countries under its 
"Delta" brand name through a network of independent and mail order 
distributors, hardware stores and home centers. 

Portable Electric Tools.  The Registrant, through its subsidiary 
Porter-Cable Corporation (Porter-Cable), manufactures and markets 
a variety of portable electric tools, such as saws, sanders, drills 
and routers, used in woodworking, industrial maintenance, and 
construction trades.  Porter-Cable markets its products under the 
brand name "Porter-Cable" through a network of independent, specialty 
tool, and mail order distributors, hardware stores and home centers.

Pumps and Pumping Systems.  The Registrant, through its F.E. Myers 
Co. Division of McNeil (Ohio) Corporation (Myers), manufactures and 
markets a wide variety of pumps for residential, environmental,
engineering, and industrial use.  Products are distributed through 
a network of distributors, wholesalers, dealers, and installers.  
In addition, Myers distributes products to the do-it-yourself market 
for retail sale through home centers and hardware stores under the 
names "Water Ace" and "Shur Dri".

Water Conditioning Control Valves.  The Registrant, through its 
subsidiary Fleck Controls, Inc. (Fleck), manufactures, designs 
and markets a broad range of control valves, timers and meters 
for residential and commercial water softeners.  Products are 
sold directly by Fleck's internal sales organization to small,
regional independent original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), 
with the remaining sales going to larger, fully integrated manufacturers.  

    Competitive conditions.

Delta participates in the middle range of the overall market 
for general purpose woodworking machinery. The addressed market is 
focused on high quality, feature oriented products and value added 
services for the home shop, contractor, and small shop markets.  
Delta markets the industry's broadest line of products for its addressed 
market.  Delta's numerous competitors do have individual products 
which compete with certain of Delta's products.  Competition in this 
market focuses on quality, features, service and price.

Porter-Cable competes in the professional portable electric tool 
market which is highly competitive.  Porter-Cable faces several major 
competitors across its addressed market.  Product innovation, features,
performance, quality, service, delivery and price are all competitive factors.

Myers addresses the water pump and system market.  Myers faces many 
competitors across its product lines.  Price, delivery, and quality 
are competitive factors.

Fleck addresses the water treatment market.  Fleck is one of the four 
primary manufacturers of control valves in the United States and Europe.  
Broad product offerings, product development and customer support and 
service are competitive factors.   Fleck has a significant market share 
in the residential valve market and a leading market share in the 
commercial valve market.  Fleck sells to both OEMs and independent 
distributors for inclusion in water control systems which are sold directly 
to the end user.

  Description of the General Industrial Equipment Segment:
    Products and marketing.

The following table sets forth, for each of the last three years, the 
General Industrial Equipment segment product class net sales 
in excess of 10 percent of consolidated net sales.

  

Electrical Enclosures.  Through the Hoffman Engineering Company 
division of Federal-Hoffman, Inc. (Hoffman Engineering), the Registrant 
manufactures enclosures and wireways for electrical and industrial
instrumentation applications and markets these products primarily 
through independent manufacturer's representatives and electrical 
and electronic equipment distributors throughout North America and the
United Kingdom.

Electronic Enclosures.  Through  Schroff GmbH and its international 
subsidiaries (Schroff), the Registrant manufactures enclosures and 
wireways for electronic instrumentation applications.  Schroff is a large
European manufacturer of cabinets, cases, subracks, microcomputer 
packaging systems and accessories. Schroff serves the worldwide 
industrial electronics industry including key segments such as computers,
test & measurement, private LANs/data communication, industrial control 
and factory automation, medical and telecommunications. 

Sporting Ammunition.  Through the Federal Cartridge Company division 
of Federal-Hoffman, Inc. (Federal Cartridge), the Registrant manufactures 
and markets sporting and law enforcement ammunition, and components.  
These products are distributed throughout the United States through a 
network of distributors; directly to large retail chains; and 
directly to law enforcement agencies (governmental).

Industrial Lubricating Systems and Material Dispensing Equipment.  
The Registrant, through its Lincoln Industrial division of McNeil 
(Ohio) Corporation (Lincoln Industrial), manufactures components and designs
systems for manual and automatic delivery of measured quantities of 
lubricants for industrial applications. Lincoln Industrial also manufactures 
components and designs, fabricates, and installs high-volume liquid
and semi-solid dispensing systems.  Both segments serve original 
equipment and retrofit markets. Lubricating and materials dispensing 
systems are marketed in the United States by approximately 100
specially qualified systems distributors with design, installation, 
and service capability.  Basic lubricating equipment and accessories are 
marketed through industrial supply and specialty distributors.  A special
direct sales group markets a wide variety of Lincoln Industrial products 
to original equipment manufacturers in a variety of industries.  
Lincoln Industrial also manufactures lubricating components and systems 
at its facility in Walldorf, Germany for distribution to European, 
Middle East, Far East and African markets, and to a lesser extent to the 
United States.  The remainder of the world market, including the Pacific Rim,
is served from Lincoln Industrial's St. Louis, Missouri manufacturing 
facility.

Automotive Service Equipment.  The Registrant, through its Lincoln 
Automotive division of  McNeil (Ohio) Corporation (Lincoln Automotive), 
manufactures and markets lubrication, repair, and service equipment for
a broad range of vehicles.  Products are sold through a key group of 
approximately 600 aftermarket wholesalers.  Certain products are sold 
to large auto parts chain stores. Certain lubricating equipment,
tools, and jacks and lifting equipment are sold under private label programs.  
Garage, service station, car dealership service department, and fast oil 
change lubricating systems are marketed through petroleum equipment and 
service distributors with design and installation capability.

    Competitive conditions.

Hoffman Engineering is the largest North American manufacturer of 
electrical enclosures and wireways, having a market share estimated 
to be about 25% of the addressed market.  It is currently the only
manufacturer with national distribution and its competitors are 
generally smaller, regional manufacturers. Hoffman Engineering also 
participates in the North American electronic enclosures market, facing
competition from a large number of firms, with three or four established 
firms leading the market.  In both markets, the most significant 
competitive factors are price, product innovation, service, quality, 
breadth of product line, and delivery.

Schroff is a significant manufacturer in Europe's electronic enclosure 
market and a  technological leader. Schroff, like Hoffman, has a 
comprehensive product range.  Schroff faces competition from a large number
of firms, some of whom like Rittal manufacture a broad range of enclosures 
and some who focus on smaller niche markets.  Significant competitive 
factors are product innovation and quality.

Federal Cartridge and its two primary competitors, Winchester and Remington, 
have a combined market share of approximately 90% in the U.S. 
sporting ammunition market, with the balance coming from smaller
domestic competitors and foreign ammunition manufacturers.  Quality, 
delivery, price and terms are significant competitive factors.

Lincoln Industrial and Lincoln Automotive face three to five major 
competitors and several smaller competitors across their product lines.  
Competition involving industrial lubricating systems and material
dispensing equipment tends to center around quality, systems capability, 
and application knowledge.  Price becomes a more significant competitive 
factor for vehicle servicing equipment.


  Information Regarding Both Segments:

    Working capital items.

Federal Cartridge's working capital builds from January through September 
as inventories are increased to meet third quarter shipping schedules and 
receivables increase due to fall dating for early order programs used in the
sporting ammunition business.  Management continues to focus on reducing 
working capital requirements through management of receivable and inventory 
levels.  

    Status of new products.

The industries in which the segments participate are essentially mature 
and do not experience the introduction of many products that 
materially change the nature of the industry.  Individual manufacturers
generally make improvements or apply new technologies to existing products.  

    Raw materials.

The raw materials used in the manufacturing process include steel (bar 
and sheet), various metals including brass and lead, gunpowder and plastic.  
Selected motors, castings, plastic parts and components are also purchased.  
The supply of all raw materials and components is currently adequate.

Delta and Porter-Cable import selected tools in their product offerings.  
Design and engineering of these products is performed primarily by Delta.  
The manufacturing process is controlled and monitored for most of these
products in factories dedicated to Delta production.  Supply of these 
products is currently adequate and timely.

    Patents, trademarks, licenses, franchises and concessions.

The businesses own a number of U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks.  
They were acquired over many years and relate to many products and
improvements.  No one patent or trademark is of material importance to 
either segment.

    Seasonal aspects.

For the either segment, there is no strongly seasonal aspect.

    Backlog.

The segments normally do not experience backlogs for substantial periods 
of time.  The nature of the businesses emphasizes maintaining 
inventories sufficient to satisfy customer needs on a timely basis, and
production and sourcing is geared towards providing adequate inventories 
in order to minimize customer back orders.  Accordingly, backlogs are 
not material to understanding the sales trends or manufacturing
fluctuations of the segments.

    Dependence on limited number of customers.

The Registrant as a whole is not dependent on a single customer or 
on a few customers.  The loss of a limited number of customers 
would not have a material adverse impact on the Registrant.

    Government contracts.

The Registrant has no material portion of sales under government 
contracts that may be subject to renegotiation of profits or 
termination of contracts at the election of the government.

    Employees.

As of December 31, 1995, the Registrant and its subsidiaries employed 
approximately 9,150 persons, of which 2,058 were represented by unions 
having collective bargaining agreements.

Labor contracts negotiated in 1995 were: International Association of 
Machinists Local 59 - Ashland, Ohio (extended to 4/6/98) approximately 310
employees;  International Association of Machinists Local 9 - 
St. Louis, Missouri (extended to 4/30/98) approximately 230 employees; 
United Steel Workers of America Local 8630 - Tupelo, Mississippi (extended 
to 5/1/98) 260 approximately employees; Patternworkers League - Ashland, Ohio 
(extended to 9/1/97) 2 employees;  and Teamsters Local 984 - Memphis, 
Tennessee (extended to 12/15/98) approximately 50 employees.

Contracts expiring in 1996: International Union of Electrical Workers - 
Jonesboro, Arkansas (expires April, 1996).

The Registrant considers its employee relations to be good and feels 
future contracts will be able to be negotiated for the benefit of the 
business and the employees.


(d)  Financial Information about Foreign Operations.

The Registrant operates primarily in North America and Europe.  See 
discussion of foreign operations incorporated by reference.

Item 3.  Legal Proceedings.

The Registrant or its subsidiaries have been made parties to actions filed, 
or have been given notice of potential claims, relating to the conduct of its 
business, including those pertaining to product liability, environmental and 
employment matters.  Major matters which may have an impact on the Registrant
are discussed below.  The Registrant believes that it is remote that the 
outcome of such matters will have a material adverse effect on the 
Registrant's financial position or future results of operations, based on
current circumstances known to the Registrant.

Federal-Hoffman, Inc.  Federal Cartridge, a division of Federal-Hoffman, 
has been named by the EPA as a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) in 
connection with a waste disposal site in Greer, South Carolina. 
The EPA issued an administrative order effective April 29, 1992 to 
Federal-Hoffman and 96 other entities to compel the cleanup of the Aqua-Tech 
Environmental, Inc. site.  Federal-Hoffman is working with a group of
other PRPs to negotiate with the EPA regarding the cleanup of the site.  
A surface cleanup of the site is complete.  Under interim allocations by 
the PRP group, Federal Cartridge paid $442,000 toward the cost of the surface 
cleanup.  Under current final allocation proposals,  Federal-Hoffman 
anticipates no additional payout for the surface cleanup.

On March 16, 1995, the EPA notified Federal Cartridge that it is a PRP 
related to the subsurface of the Aqua-Tech site.  The PRP group 
anticipates beginning a study of the soil and groundwater to determine the
extent of subsurface contamination.  The cost of such study, any necessary 
remediation and the size of allocation, if any, to Federal-Hoffman 
is unknown to the Registrant at this time.   Federal-Hoffman however,
anticipates its allocation in the subsurface action to be positively 
impacted by the nature of its waste and the fact that virtually all of its 
waste was accounted for and removed during the surface remediation.

In October 1992, Hoffman Engineering, a division of Federal-Hoffman, 
was also named as a PRP in connection with the Aqua-Tech site.  
Hoffman has settled out of both the surface and subsurface remediation as 
a de minimis party. 

Federal Cartridge, a division of Federal-Hoffman, and 79 manufacturers, 
distributors and retailers of ammunition and/or firearms were sued in 
July 1995 by a private environmental group pursuant to California Health and 
Safety Code Section 25249 (Proposition 65) and the Business and Professions 
Code Section 17200.  The lawsuit alleged violations of California law 
arising from exposure to lead from the discharge or cleaning of firearms.  
Claims were made for injunctive relief, statutory penalties and attorneys 
fees.  An industry-wide settlement was approved by the court in January 1996.
Federal Cartridge's share will be less than $10,000.

Porter-Cable Corporation.  In November 1993, the Tennessee Department 
of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) issued to Porter-Cable Corporation 
(Porter-Cable) and Rockwell International Corporation (Rockwell) an 
administrative order requiring them to investigate, and if necesssary clean up
alleged groundwater contamination at a manufacturing facility located in 
Madison County, Tennessee.  The facility was acquired by Porter Cable 
from Rockwell in 1981.  Porter Cable reached an agreement with Rockwell
regarding sharing costs and expenses related to investigation of the site.  
The Registrant believes that this matter is unlikely to result in material 
liability or material changes in operations.  No estimate of the projected 
response cost liability can be made based on information currently known to
the Company.


Discontinued Paper Operations. Responsibility for certain environmental 
obligations and potential liability of the Registrant's former Cross 
Pointe Paper Corporation subsidiary were retained by the Registrant as a
part of the sale of Cross Pointe. At the time of the sale, the Registrant 
established reserves for potential liabilities relating to environmental 
conditions existing on or before April 1995, based on extensive studies
of the sites involved.  Costs for certain of these environmental conditions 
are borne entirely by the Registrant; for other conditions, the Registrant 
bears only a portion of the costs which may be incurred in connection therewith.
In 1995, the Registrant paid approximately $585,000 in costs covered by those
reserves.  The Registrant is closely monitoring the status of all open 
environmental conditions and has established procedures with the buyer 
dealing with activities at the affected sites.

Few of the retained liabilities involve conditions or sites that are active 
at this time.  One matter, however, has been previously reported in the 
Company's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 1994.  In February 1994, 
the Miami mill (Miami) of Cross Pointe Paper Corporation was named a PRP 
in connection with the IWD/Cardington landfill in Moraine, Ohio.  
Waste haulers with whom Miami contracted to transport its flyash and paper 
and wood waste allegedly took it to this landfill for some time prior to its 
closure in 1980.  The EPA has identified 22 other PRPs at this time.  The 
cost of remediation of the site is estimated to be approximately $12 to $15 
million.  Miami recently settled this matter for $178,000.  Based on current
information available to it, the Registrant believes that this matter is 
unlikely to result in material future liability.

Responsibility for environmental obligations of the Registrant's former 
Niagara of Wisconsin Paper Corporation subsidiary and its two joint ventures, 
Lake Superior Paper Industries and Superior Recycled Fiber Industries, 
was not retained as part of the sale of these entities.  Customary warranties
were given regarding unknown environmental conditions at these sites, but 
the Registrant does not anticipate any significant liability therefor.

Product Liability Claims.   As of March 4, 1996, the Registrant or its 
subsidiaries are defendants in approximately 177 product liability lawsuits 
and have been notified of approximately 118 additional claims. The Registrant 
has had and currently has in place insurance coverage it deems adequate for 
its needs.  A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured by 
Penwald, a regulated insurance company wholly owned by Registrant.  See 
discussion in Item 7 (MD&A - Insurance Subsidiary) and Item 8 (Note 1 to the
Financial Statements).    Accounting reserves covering the deductible 
portion of liability claims not covered by Penwald have been established 
and are reviewed on a regular basis.  The Registrant has not experienced 
unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product 
liability claims.

                 and Financial Disclosure.
       
No changes in accountants or disagreements between the Registrant and its 
accountants regarding accounting principles or financial statement 
disclosures have occurred within the 24 months prior to the date of the
Registrant's most recent financial statements.
