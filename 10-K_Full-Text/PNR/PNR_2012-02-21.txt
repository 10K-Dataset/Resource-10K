Customers

Water & Fluid
Solutions distributes its products through wholesale distributors, retail distributors, original equipment manufacturers, home centers, home and pool builders and directly to customers and end-users. Information regarding significant customers in
Water & Fluid Solutions is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within
Water & Fluid Solutions. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales increase is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early
buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts.

Competition

Water &
Fluid Solutions faces numerous domestic and international competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources directed to the markets in which we compete. Consolidation and globalization are continuing trends in the water industry.
Competition in commercial and residential flow technologies markets focuses on brand names, product performance (including energy-efficient offerings), quality and price. While home center and national retailers are important for residential lines
of water and wastewater pumps, they are not important for commercial pumps. For municipal pumps, competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications, service and price. Competition in fluid treatment, filtration and processing focuses
on product performance and design, quality, delivery and price. For pool equipment, competition focuses on brand names, product performance (including energy-efficient offerings), quality and price. We compete by offering a wide variety of
innovative and high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market penetration.

TECHNICAL PRODUCTS

Pentair Technical Products is a leading provider of products that guard
and protect some of the world’s most sensitive electronics and electronic equipment, ensuring their safe, secure and reliable performance. Our



innovative product offering includes mild steel, stainless steel, aluminum and non-metallic enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes and associated thermal management systems. Our
products serve a range of end-markets, including use in industrial, communications (including telecommunications and data communications), networking, general electronics, energy, commercial infrastructure, security and defense and medical.

Brand names for Technical Products include Hoffman

®

, McLean

®

and Schroff

®

.

Customers

Technical Products
distributes its products through electrical and data contractors, electrical and electronic components distributors and original equipment manufacturers. Information regarding significant customers in Technical Products is contained in ITEM 8,
Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Technical Products is not significantly affected by seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the technical products markets can be intense,
particularly in the Communications market, where product design, prototyping, global supply, price competition and customer service are significant factors. Technical Products has continued to focus on cost control and improving profitability.
Recent sales increases in Technical Products are the result of growth from initiatives focused on product development, continued channel penetration, growth in targeted market segments, geographic expansion and price increases. Consolidation,
globalization and outsourcing are visible trends in the technical products marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier. We believe Technical Products has the global manufacturing capability and broad
product portfolio to support the globalization and outsourcing trends.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

On May 12, 2011, we acquired as part of Water & Fluid Solutions, the Clean Process Technologies (“CPT) division of
privately held Norit Holding B.V. for $715.3 million (€502.7 million translated at the May 12, 2011 exchange rate). CPT’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.
CPT is a global leader in membrane solutions and clean process technologies in the high growth water and beverage filtration and separation segments. CPT provides sustainable purification systems and solutions for desalination, water reuse,
industrial applications and beverage segments that effectively address the increasing challenges of clean water scarcity, rising energy costs and pollution. CPT’s product offerings include innovative ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane
technologies, aseptic valves, CO


recovery and control
systems and specialty pumping equipment. Based in the Netherlands, CPT has broad sales diversity with the majority of 2011 and 2010 revenues generated in European Union and Asia-Pacific countries.

The $155.1 million increase in Water & Fluid Solutions backlog was primarily due to increased backlog related to the
May, 2011 acquisition of CPT. The $17.9 million decrease in Technical Products backlog reflected larger telecommunications project backlog at December 31, 2010. Due to the relatively short manufacturing cycle and



general industry practice for the majority of our businesses, backlog, which typically represents less than 60 days of shipments, is not deemed to be a significant item. A substantial portion of
our revenues result from orders received and product sold in the same month. We expect that most of our backlog at December 31, 2011 will be filled in 2012.

Research and development

We primarily conduct research and development activities
in our own facilities. These efforts consist primarily of the development of new products, product applications and manufacturing processes. Research and development expenditures during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $78.2 million, $67.2 million and $57.9
million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7 and in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Raw materials

The principal
materials used in the manufacturing of our products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel, electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies), copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials,
we purchase some finished goods for distribution through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are
purchased on the open market and the majority are available through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments,
principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are
available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist and we believe that the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations.

Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with price
adjustment clauses for significant commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in the future.

Intellectual property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
customer relationships, trade marks, trade names and brand names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer
relationship, trade mark, trade name or brand name.

Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire or terminate over time by
operation of law, in accordance with their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of
December 31, 2011, we employed approximately 15,300 people worldwide. Total employees in the United States were approximately 6,900, of whom approximately 440 are represented by four different trade unions having collective bargaining
agreements. Generally, labor relations have been satisfactory.

Captive insurance subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property, workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned
captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties, such as
liabilities arising from acquired businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain foreign operations are established.



Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements – Insurance Subsidiary, included in this Form 10-K.

Available information

We make available free of charge (other than an investor’s own Internet access charges) through our Internet website (

reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reports of beneficial ownership filed by our directors and executive officers pursuant to Section 16(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are also available on our website. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

You should carefully
consider the following risk factors and warnings before making an investment decision. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all
such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. If any of the risks described below actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects
could be materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to other information set forth in this document. We assume no obligation, and
disclaim any duty, to update risk factors in this report except as required by law.

General economic conditions, including difficult
credit and residential construction markets, affect demand for our products.

We compete around the world in various geographic
regions and product markets. Among these, the most significant are global industrial markets (for both Technical Products and Water & Fluid Solutions) and residential markets (for Water & Fluid Solutions). Important factors for our
businesses include the overall strength of the economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy; industrial and governmental capital spending; the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets; unemployment rates;
availability of consumer and commercial financing for our customers and end-users; and interest rates. New construction for housing and home improvement activity fell in 2007, 2008 and 2009, which reduced revenue growth in the residential business
within Water & Fluid Solutions. While we saw some stabilization in 2010 and 2011, we believe that weakness in this market could negatively impact our revenues and margins in future periods. While we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic
or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and geographic regions, we cannot assure you that a significant or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region would not have a material adverse effect on us.

We are exposed to political, regulatory, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.

Sales outside of the United States, including export sales from our domestic businesses, accounted for approximately 40% of our net
sales in 2011. Further, most of our businesses obtain some products, components and raw materials from foreign suppliers. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, regulatory, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in
numerous countries. These risks include:

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;

•

relatively more severe economic conditions in some international markets than in the United States;

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;



•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements and restrictions;

•

the possibility of terrorist action affecting us or our operations;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other trade restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in non-U.S. labor markets;

•

changes in tax laws or rulings could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate;

•

the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in foreign countries; and

•

changes in and required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations.

As a result of our international operations and sales, we are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and other laws
that prohibit improper payments or offers of improper payments. Our international activities create risk under such laws because our employees, consultants, sales agents or distributors are not always subject to our direct control. Any violations or
alleged violations of these laws could result in significant fines or settlements, criminal sanctions against us or our employees, reputational damage and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including our business with the U.S. government.

Our business success depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We cannot assure you that
these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business as a whole.

Our
international operations are subject to foreign market and currency fluctuation risks and the European Union debt crisis could adversely affect our results.

We expect the percentage of our sales outside of the United States to continue to increase in the future. In some cases, foreign markets are susceptible to greater political, economic and social
volatility than in our other markets. Furthermore, our increased foreign business operations expose us to currency fluctuations which could materially affect our financial results. The European Union currently accounts for the majority of our
foreign sales and income. The current debt crisis in Europe could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in certain European Union countries or in the wholesale dissolution of the euro currency. The resulting impact on euro-denominated
obligations and assets is impossible to predict, but it could adversely affect the value of such obligations and assets. Also, the effect of the debt crisis in Europe could have an adverse affect on the capital markets generally, specifically
impacting the ability of our business and financial partners to finance their businesses on acceptable terms, if at all, the availability of materials and supplies and demand for our products.

Our inability to sustain organic growth could adversely affect our financial performance.

Over the past five years, our organic growth has been generated in part from expanding international sales, entering new distribution channels,
introducing new products and price increases. To grow more rapidly than our end markets, we would have to continue to expand our geographic reach, further diversify our distribution channels, continue to introduce new products and increase sales of
existing products to our customer base. Difficult economic and competitive factors may materially and adversely impact our financial performance. We have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end markets and geographies. We cannot
assure you that these growth initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets.

We may not be able to expand
through acquisitions and acquisitions we complete may adversely affect our financial performance.

We intend to continue to evaluate
strategic acquisitions primarily in our current business segments, though we may consider acquisitions outside of these segments as well. Our ability to expand through acquisitions is subject to various risks, including the following:

•

Limitations on pursuing acquisitions due to increased leverage;



•

Higher acquisition prices;

•

Lack of suitable acquisition candidates in targeted product or market areas; and

•

Increased competition for acquisitions, especially in the water industry.

We may not realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, any benefits may take longer to realize than we expect and acquisitions we complete may adversely affect our financial performance.

Any acquisition involves the integration of acquired operations with our existing operations and there are uncertainties inherent in
such an integration. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to such an integration and delays or unexpected difficulties in the integration process could adversely affect our business, financial results and
financial condition. Even if we are successful in integrating acquired operations, we may not achieve the full benefits of revenue synergies, cost savings and operational efficiencies that we expect or within the time we expect. Acquisitions we may
undertake could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters immediately following the acquisitions, while we attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our operations. In
addition, we may have not discovered during due diligence all facts and factors that could produce unintended or unexpected consequences for us, including financial liabilities, which could be material and result in us not achieving the expected
benefits from the acquisition within our desired time frames, if at all.

As we continue our integration of CPT’s operations with our
existing operations, uncertainties remain and we may not achieve the full expected benefits of that acquisition, including revenue synergies, cost savings and operational efficiencies, or within the time we expect.

Increased leverage may harm our financial condition and results of operations.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $1,309.1 million of total debt on a consolidated basis. Any future increase in our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations,
including, without limitation:

•

cash requirements to support the payment of interest on our outstanding indebtedness may increase;

•

increases in our outstanding indebtedness and leverage may increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions,
as well as to competitive pressure;

•

our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes may be reduced;

•

our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry may be reduced; and

•

our flexibility to make acquisitions and develop technology may be limited.

Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other
factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, we may be required, among
other things:

•

to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;

•

to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;

•

to sell selected assets or businesses; or

•

to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures.



Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements.
In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms, if at all.

The
availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on our financial performance.

Our plans to vigorously compete in our
chosen markets will require additional capital for future acquisitions, capital expenditures, growth of working capital and continued international and regional expansion. In the past, we have financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash
from operations and debt financing. While we have availability under our primary credit agreements on what we believe to be favorable terms, future acquisitions or other uses of funds may require us to expand our debt financing resources or to issue
equity securities. Our financial results may be adversely affected if new financing is not available on favorable terms or if interest costs under our debt financings are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other internal growth. In
addition, future share issuances could be dilutive to your equity investment if we sell shares into the market or issue additional stock as consideration in any acquisition. We cannot assure you that we will be able to issue equity securities or
obtain future debt financing at favorable terms. Without sufficient financing, we will not be able to pursue our targeted growth strategy and our acquisition program, which may limit our revenue growth and future financial performance.

We have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a material negative
impact on our financial results.

We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, by
comparing the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their respective carrying values on their balance sheets. At December 31, 2011 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $2,866.2 million and represented
approximately 62.5% of our total assets. Long-term declines in projected future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible asset impairments. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of
these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed our annual goodwill
impairment review. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $200.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This represents impairment of goodwill in our Residential Filtration reporting unit, part of Water & Fluid
Solutions. The impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the end-markets served by residential water treatment components.

Material cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could continue to affect our results of operations.

In the past, we have experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of our businesses. We strive for productivity improvements and implement
increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials (especially metals and resins), energy and other costs such as pension, health care and insurance. We continue to implement operational initiatives in order to mitigate the
impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs. We cannot assure you, however, that these actions will be successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity. Continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to
generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results of operations.

Our businesses operate in
highly competitive markets, so we may be forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs.

Our businesses generally face substantial
competition in each of their respective markets. Competition may force us to cut prices or to incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis of product design, quality, availability, performance, customer service and price.
Present or future competitors may have greater



financial, technical or other resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected business or businesses. We cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material
adverse effect on our future results of operations.

Seasonality of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial
results.

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within Water & Fluid Solutions. End-user demand for pool equipment
in our primary markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales increase is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or “early buy” programs (generally including
extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts. We cannot assure you that seasonality and weather
conditions will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Intellectual property challenges may hinder product
development and marketing.

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trade marks, trade
names and brand names are important to our business. Intellectual property protection, however, may not preclude competitors from developing products similar to ours or from challenging our names or products. Our pending patent applications, and our
pending copyright and trademark registration applications, may not be allowed or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents, copyrights or trademarks. In addition, our patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual
property rights may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. Over the past few years, we have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a means to
compete. Patent and trademark challenges increase our costs to develop, engineer and market our products. We may need to spend significant resources monitoring our intellectual property rights and we may or may not be able to detect infringement by
third parties

Our results of operations may be negatively impacted by litigation.

Our businesses expose us to potential litigation, such as product liability claims relating to the design, manufacture and sale of our products. While we
currently maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection against potential
liabilities. In addition, we self-insure a portion of product liability claims. A series of successful claims against us for significant amounts could materially and adversely affect our product reputation, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows.

We are exposed to potential environmental and other laws, liabilities and litigation.

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing our environmental practices, public and worker health and safety and
the indoor and outdoor environment. Compliance with these environmental, health and safety regulations could require us to satisfy environmental liabilities, increase the cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Any violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer. We are also required to comply with various
environmental laws and maintain permits, some of which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time, for many of our businesses and we could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may
require.

We have been named as defendants, targets or potentially responsible parties (“PRP”) in a number of environmental
clean-ups relating to our current or former business units. We have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers. We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing business units, as well as both divested and acquired businesses.



We cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or
that our eventual environmental clean-up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

We are exposed to
certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.

Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide.
Many scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The U.S. Congress
and federal and state regulatory agencies have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions. It is uncertain whether, when and in what form a federal mandatory carbon dioxide emissions
reduction program may be adopted. Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol and this and other international initiatives under consideration could affect our international operations. These actions could increase costs associated
with our operations, including costs for raw materials and transportation. Because it is uncertain what laws will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial condition, results of operations
or cash flows.

PROPERTIES

Our principal executive
office is in leased premises located in Golden Valley, Minnesota. We carry out our Water & Fluid Solutions manufacturing operations at 26 plants located throughout the United States and at 21 plants located in 12 other countries. In addition,
Water & Fluid Solutions has 35 distribution facilities and 53 sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world. We carry out our Technical Products manufacturing operations at 6 plants located throughout the United States and 10
plants located in 8 other countries. In addition, Technical Products has 9 distribution facilities and 25 sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We have been made
parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes, product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent infringement
and employment matters.

While we believe that a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows
from any such future claims or potential claims is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material
impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As a
result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named
as defendants, targets or PRP in a small number of environmental clean-ups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in clean-up costs, fines,
penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses in the past years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated
paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the Tools Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years; to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are
ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites. We do not believe that projected
response costs will result in a material liability. We have also made claims against third parties for indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental remediations or other obligations. We cannot assure you that we will be successful
in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for such costs.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired
businesses. When the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to



environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our undiscounted reserves
for such environmental liabilities were approximately $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental
clean-up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Product liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued
for by Penwald, our captive insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these claims based on
actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated
based on existing information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. In 2004, we disposed of the Tools Group and we retained responsibility for certain product claims. We have not experienced significant
unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims.

ITEM 5.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Our common stock is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “PNR.” As of December 31, 2011, there
were 3,631 shareholders of record.

The high, low and closing sales price for our common stock and the dividends declared for each of the
quarterly periods for 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

Pentair has paid 144 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased dividends each year for 35 consecutive years.



Stock Performance Graph

The following information under the caption “Stock Performance Graph” in this ITEM 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be
“filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A or 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference
into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent we specifically incorporate it by reference into such a filing.

The following graph sets forth the cumulative total shareholder return on our common stock for the last five years, assuming the investment of $100 on December 31, 2006 and the reinvestment of all
dividends since that date to December 31, 2011. The graph also contains for comparison purposes the S&P 500 Index and the S&P MidCap 400 Index, assuming the same investment level and reinvestment of dividends.

By virtue of our market capitalization, we are a component of the S&P MidCap 400 Index. On the basis of our size and diversity of businesses, we have
not found a readily identifiable peer group for purposes of the following graph. We believe the S&P MidCap 400 Index is an appropriate comparison. We have evaluated other published indices, but have determined that the results are skewed by
significantly larger companies included in the indices. We believe such a comparison would not be meaningful.



Purchases of Equity Securities

The following table provides information with respect to purchases we made of our common stock during the fourth quarter of 2011:

(a)

The purchases in this column includes 0 shares for the period October 2 – October 29, 2011, 163 shares for the period October 30 –

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company comprised of two operating segments: Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical
Products. Water & Fluid Solutions is a global leader in providing innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement, storage, treatment and enjoyment of water. Technical Products is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal
management markets, designing and manufacturing standard, modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them. In 2011, Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical
Products accounted for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of total revenues, respectively.

Water & Fluid Solutions has progressively become a more
important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from approximately $125 million in 1995 to approximately $2.4 billion in 2011. We believe the water industry is structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for clean water
and the large global market size. Our vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement, storage, treatment and enjoyment of water.

Technical Products operates in a large global market with significant potential for growth in industry segments such as industrial, energy, infrastructure and communications. We believe we have the
largest industrial and commercial distribution network in North America for enclosures and the highest brand recognition in the industry in North America.

In May 2011, we acquired as part of Water & Fluid Solutions, the CPT division of privately held Norit Holding B.V. for $715.3 million (€502.7 million translated at the May 12, 2011 exchange
rate). CPT’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. CPT is a global leader in membrane solutions and clean process technologies in the high growth water and beverage
filtration and separation segments. CPT provides sustainable purification systems and solutions for desalination, water reuse, industrial applications and beverage segments that effectively address the increasing challenges of clean water scarcity,
rising energy costs and pollution. CPT’s product offerings include innovative ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane technologies, aseptic valves, CO


recovery and control systems and specialty pumping equipment. Based in the Netherlands, CPT has broad sales diversity with
the majority of 2011 and 2010 revenues generated in European Union and Asia-Pacific countries.

The fair value of the business acquired was
allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value acquired over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is reflected as goodwill. Goodwill recorded as part of
the purchase price allocation was $451.8 million, none of which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $197.2 million, including definite-lived intangibles, such as customer relationships,
proprietary technology and trade names with a weighted average amortization period of approximately 10 years.



In January 2011 we acquired as part of Water & Fluid Solutions, all of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of Hidro Filtros do Brasil (“Hidro Filtros”) for cash of $14.9 million and a note payable of $2.1 million. The Hidro Filtros results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of
acquisition. Hidro Filtros is a leading manufacturer of water filters and filtering elements for residential and industrial applications operating in Brazil and neighboring countries. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was
$10.1 million, none of which is tax deductible. Identified intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $6.3 million including definite-lived intangibles, primarily customer relationships, of $5.5 million with an estimated life of 13
years.

Additionally, during 2011, we completed other small acquisitions with purchase prices totaling $4.6 million, consisting of $2.9
million in cash and $1.7 million as a note payable, adding to Water & Fluid Solutions. Total goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was $4.3 million, none of which is tax deductible.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed our annual goodwill impairment review. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of
$200.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This represents impairment of goodwill in our Residential Filtration reporting unit, part of Water & Fluid Solutions. The impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic
conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the end-markets served by residential water treatment components.

Key Trends and Uncertainties

Our
sales revenue for the full year of 2011 was approximately $3.5 billion, increasing 14% from sales in the prior year. Water & Fluid Solutions sales increased 16% in the year to approximately $2.4 billion, compared to the same period in 2010.
Technical Products sales increased 10% to approximately $1.1 billion as compared to the same period in 2010.

The following trends and
uncertainties affected our financial performance in 2011 and will likely impact our results in the future:

•

Most markets we serve slowed dramatically in late 2008 and throughout 2009 as a result of the global recession. In 2010 and 2011, most markets showed
signs of improvement. Because our businesses are significantly affected by general economic trends, a lack of continued improvement in our most important markets addressed below would likely have an adverse impact on our results of operation for
2012 and beyond.

•

We have also identified specific market opportunities that we continue to pursue that we find attractive, both within and outside the United States. We
are reinforcing our businesses to more effectively address these opportunities through research and development and additional sales and marketing resources. Unless we successfully penetrate these product and geographic markets, our organic growth
would likely be limited.

•

After four years of new home building and new pool start contraction in the United States, these end markets stabilized in 2010 and 2011. Although
stabilized, these end markets have not shown significant signs of improvement and continue at historically low levels. While we expect new product introductions, expanded distribution and channel penetration to result in volume increases for 2012,
continued stagnation in new housing construction and new pool starts could negatively impact our ability to grow sales in the future. Overall, we believe approximately 35% of Pentair sales are used in global residential applications for replacement,
refurbishment, remodeling, repair and new construction.

•

Industrial markets slowed significantly in 2009. Order rates and sales improved in our industrial business in 2010 and 2011. We believe that the
outlook for industrial markets is mixed. Any significant reduction in global capital spending could adversely impact our results in the future.

•

Through 2010 and 2011, we experienced material and other cost inflation. We strive for productivity improvements, and we implement increases in selling
prices to help mitigate this inflation. We expect the



current economic environment will result in continuing price volatility for many of our raw materials. Commodity prices have begun to moderate, but we are uncertain as to the timing and impact of
these market changes.

•

Primarily due to lower discount rates, our unfunded pension liabilities increased by $41 million to approximately $242 million as of the end of 2011.
We anticipate that our 2012 pension expense will increase over 2011 levels.

•

We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent of our net income. We define free cash flow as cash
flow from continuing operating activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of property and equipment. Free cash flow for the full year 2011 was approximately $248 million, exceeding our goal of 100% net income conversion. We
continue to expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income from continuing operations in 2012. We are continuing to target reductions in working capital and particularly inventory, as a percentage of sales. See our discussion of

Other
financial measures

under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this report for a reconciliation of our free cash flow.

In 2012, our operating objectives include the following:

•

Increasing our presence in fast growth regions and vertical market focus to grow in those markets in which we have competitive advantages;

•

Optimizing our technological capabilities to increasingly generate innovative new products;

•

Driving operating excellence through lean enterprise initiatives, with specific focus on sourcing and supply management, cash flow management and lean
operations; and

•

Focusing on developing global talent in light of our increased global presence (39% of our 2011 net sales were generated outside the United States).

We may seek to meet our objectives of expanding our geographic reach internationally, expanding our presence in our various
channels to market and acquiring technologies and products to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional markets through acquisitions. We may also consider the divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our businesses
on their most attractive markets.

•

2010 sales resulting from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Project which did not reoccur in 2011.

The 10.5 percentage point increase in Water & Fluid Solutions net sales in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by:

•

organic sales growth of approximately 10.3 percent in 2010 (excluding foreign currency exchange) primarily due to higher sales of certain pump, pool
and filtration products primarily related to the stabilization in the North American residential housing markets and other global markets following the global recession in 2009 primarily related to:

•

increased sales resulting from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway Project;

•

continued sales growth in India, China and in other emerging markets in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Latin America; and

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

price concessions in the form of growth rebates.

Technical Products

The 9.8 percentage point increase in Technical Products
sales in 2011 from 2010 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales in industrial, energy and general electronics vertical markets;

•

favorable foreign currency effects; and

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales within the communications vertical market.

The 17.1 percentage point increase in Technical Products net sales in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by:

•

organic sales growth of approximately 17.7 percent in 2010 (excluding foreign currency exchange) primarily related to:

•

an increase in sales in industrial, general electronics, communications, energy and infrastructure vertical markets; and

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2010 primarily related to the euro.

higher sales volumes in Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical Products and higher fixed cost absorption resulting from that volume;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives, including lean and supply management practices; and

•

selective increases in selling prices in Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical Products to mitigate inflationary cost increases.

These increases were partially offset by:

•

inflationary increases related to raw materials and labor costs; and

•

higher cost of goods sold in 2011 as a result of a fair market value inventory step-up and customer backlog recorded as a part of the CPT purchase
accounting.

The 1.5 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in 2010 from 2009 was primarily
the result of:

•

higher sales volumes in Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical Products and higher fixed cost absorption resulting from that volume;

•

cost savings from restructuring actions and other personnel reductions taken in response to the economic downturn and resulting volume decline in 2009;
and

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and supply management practices across both Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical
Products.

These increases were partially offset by:

insurance proceeds related to the Horizon litigation and other legal settlements received in 2010 which did not reoccur at the same levels in 2011; and

•

continued investments in future growth with emphasis on international markets, including personnel and business infrastructure investments.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

higher sales volume in Water & Fluid Solutions, which resulted in increased leverage of the fixed cost base;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and supply management practices; and

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases.

The 2.4 percentage point increase in Water & Fluid Solutions operating income as a percentage of net sales in 2010 as compared to 2009 was
primarily the result of:

•

higher sales volume in Water & Fluid Solutions, which resulted in increased leverage of the fixed cost base;

•

cost savings from restructuring actions and other personnel reductions taken throughout 2009 to consolidate and streamline operations;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and supply management practices;

•

impairment change of $11.3 million in 2009 for selected trade names resulting from volume declines; and



•

insurance proceeds related to the Horizon litigation and other legal settlements received in 2010.

These increases were offset by:

•

cost increases for certain raw materials and labor as well as reinstatement of certain employee benefits; and

•

continued investment in future growth with emphasis on growth in international markets.

In March 2009, we announced the redemption of all of our remaining outstanding $133.9 million aggregate principal of our 7.85% Senior Notes due
2009. These notes were redeemed on April 15, 2009 at a redemption price of $1,035.88 per $1,000 of principal outstanding plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a loss of $4.8 million on early
extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2009. The loss included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of $0.3 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of
$5.0 million related to the redemption and other costs associated with the purchase.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from
operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities and in certain instances, public and private debt and equity offerings. We have grown our businesses in significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by
credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from time to time, by private or public debt issuance. Our primary revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for these purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit
facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions.

We are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying existing debt, while
continuing to fund our research and development, marketing and capital investment initiatives. Our intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity position.

We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal demand in a number of markets within Water & Fluid Solutions. We generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for operational
purposes, which usage reverses in the second quarter as the seasonality of our businesses peaks. End-user demand for pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of the
sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms and/or additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural water systems is also impacted by
weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts.

Operating activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $320.2 million in 2011 or $49.8 million higher than in 2010. The increase in cash provided by
operating activities was due primarily to an increase in net income before non-cash items, partially offset by increased working capital necessary to support revenue growth.

Cash provided by operating activities was $270.4 million in 2010 or $12.0 million higher than in 2009. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a reduction in
working capital, partially offset by an accelerated pension contribution of $25 million and lower income from continuing operations.

Investing activities

Capital
expenditures in 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $73.3 million, $59.5 million and $54.1 million, respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 to be approximately $75 to $85 million, primarily for capacity expansions
in our low cost country manufacturing facilities, new product development and general maintenance capital.

In January 2011, we acquired as
part of Water & Fluid Solutions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Hidro Filtros for cash of $14.9 million and a note payable of $2.1 million.

In May 2011, we acquired as part of Water & Fluid Solutions, the CPT division from privately held Norit Holding for $715.3 million.

Additionally, during 2011, we completed other small acquisitions with purchase prices totaling $4.6 million, consisting of $2.9 million in cash and $1.7 million as a note payable, adding to Water &
Fluid Solutions.

Financing activities

Net cash provided by financing activities was $503.6 million in 2011 and net cash used for financing activities was $190.6 million in 2010 and $209.1 in 2009. The increase in 2011 primarily related
to borrowing utilized to fund the CPT acquisition. Additionally, financing activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of business, payments of dividends, cash
received/used for stock issued to employees, repurchase of common stock and tax benefits related to stock-based compensation.



In May 2011, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.00% Senior
Notes due 2021 (the “Notes”). The Notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that are also guarantors under our primary bank credit facility. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance
in part the CPT acquisition.

In April 2011, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”).
The Credit Facility replaced our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility creates an unsecured, committed credit facility of up to $700 million, with multi-currency sub facilities to support investments outside the U.S.
The Credit Facility expires on April 28, 2016. Borrowings under the Credit Facility currently bear interest at the rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.75%. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility will vary
based on our credit ratings. We used borrowings under the Credit Facility to fund a portion of the CPT acquisition and to fund ongoing operations.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use the Credit Facility as back-up liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper
outstanding. Our use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the relative interest rates for our commercial paper compared to the cost of borrowing under our Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011, we had $3.5 million of
commercial paper outstanding.

Total availability under our existing Credit Facility was $528.0 million as of December 31, 2011, which
was limited to $480.3 million by the leverage ratio financial covenant in the credit agreement.

Our debt agreements contain certain financial
covenants, the most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash compensation expense, as defined) that may not
exceed 3.5 to 1.0 as of the last date of each of our fiscal quarters. We were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements as of December 31, 2011.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of $74.2 million, of which $14.1 million was outstanding at December 31, 2011. Borrowings
under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates. Additionally, as part of the CPT acquisition we assumed certain capital leases with an outstanding balance of $15.8 million at December 31, 2011.

We have $105 million of outstanding private placement debt maturing in May 2012. We classified this debt as long-term as of December 31, 2011 as we
have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

Our cost of and ability to obtain
debt financing may be impacted by our credit ratings. Our long-term debt is rated at BBB- by Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) with stable outlook and Baa3 by Moody’s with stable outlook.

We issue short-term commercial paper notes that are currently not rated by S&P or Moody’s. Even though our short-term commercial paper is
unrated, we believe a downgrade in our credit rating could have a negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated commercial paper.

We do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our credit rating by either S&P or Moody’s would substantially affect our ability to access the
long-term debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions, the amount, timing and pricing of new borrowings and interest rates under our Credit Facility could be adversely affected. If both of our credit ratings were downgraded to
below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the term debt capital markets would be reduced.

A credit rating is a current opinion of the
creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program. The credit rating takes into



consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated. The
ratings outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable events and short-term trends that cause ratings to be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies. A change in rating
outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs and
capital expenditures, to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders annually. We believe we have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash requirements by using available cash and internally generated funds and
to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities.

We paid dividends in 2011 of $79.5 million, compared with
$75.5 million in 2010 and $70.9 million in 2009. We recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2012 from $0.80 per share in 2011 to $0.88 per share in 2012, which is the 36th consecutive year in which we have increased our
dividend.

In July 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25
million. As of December 31, 2010 we had repurchased 734,603 shares for $25 million pursuant to this plan. In December 2010, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25
million. As of December 31, 2011, we had repurchased 389,300 shares for $12.5 million pursuant to this authorization, which expired in December 2011. In December 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common
stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. This authorization expires in December 2012.

The following summarizes our significant
contractual obligations that impact our liquidity:

In addition to the summary of significant contractual obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on outstanding
variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2011, variable interest rate debt, including the effects of derivative financial instruments, was $202.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 2.25%.

The estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic qualified pension plan in accordance
with the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Pension and post retirement plan contributions are based on an assumed discount rate of 5.05% for all periods and an expected rate of return on plan assets ranging from 5.05% to 7.50%.

The total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at December 31, 2011 is estimated to be approximately $26.5 million. We record penalties
and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in

Provision for income taxes



and

Interest expense

, respectively, which is consistent with our past practices. As of December 31, 2011, we had recorded approximately $0.9 million for the possible
payment of penalties and $5.9 million related to the possible payment of interest.

Other financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing and financing classifications included in the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure our free cash flow. We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of net income from continuing operations. Free cash flow is a non-Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated
from operations that is available to pay dividends, make acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase shares. In addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow:

Off-balance sheet arrangements

At December 31, 2011, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets or PRP in a small number of environmental clean-ups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de minimis

status. To date,
none of these claims have resulted in clean-up costs, fines, penalties or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases, such as the
disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the Tools Group in
2004, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years; to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
remediation costs at these sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a
PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been
made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”). As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately $1.5 million and
$1.3 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental clean-up costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
reserves.



Stand-by letters of credit and bonds

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of
our projects in process and in our backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of December 31, 2011 and
2010, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled $136.2 million and $116.5 million, respectively.

NEW ACCOUNTING
STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently adopted
accounting standards or accounting standards to be adopted in the future.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies
are more fully described in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for
calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry and
information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of
operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of
the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed.

Goodwill is tested
at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair
value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists
and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any, that should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s
goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation.

The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting discounted future cash flows
requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable
publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. Actual results may differ from those used in our valuations.



In developing our discounted cash flow analysis, assumptions about future revenues and expenses, capital
expenditures and changes in working capital are based on our annual operating plan and long-term business plan for each of our reporting units. These plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated future
economic conditions, changes in raw material prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in. These assumptions are determined over a five year long-term planning period. The five year growth rates for revenues
and operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated. Revenues and operating profit beyond 2018 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate between 3.0% and 3.5%.

Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our weighted-average cost of
capital. We utilized a discount rate ranging from 12.6% to 14% in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis.

In
estimating fair value using the market approach, we identify a group of comparable publicly-traded companies for each operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product offering. These groups of comparable companies are used to develop
multiples based on total market-based invested capital as a multiple of EBITDA. We determine our estimated values by applying these comparable EBITDA multiples to the operating results of our reporting units. The ultimate fair value of each
reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods.

In connection with our annual impairment test, we determined
that the fair value of one of our reporting units did not exceed its carrying value by a significant amount. Goodwill for this reporting unit was $799.9 million at December 31, 2011. If cash flow projections decreased by 6.7% or if the discount
rate increased by 70 basis points (the discount rate used in the impairment analysis was 12.6%), this reporting unit would have failed the step one test and a step two analysis would have been required.

Impairment charge

In the fourth quarter
of 2011, we completed our annual goodwill impairment review. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $200.5 million. This represents impairment of goodwill in our Residential Filtration reporting unit, part of Water &
Fluid Solutions. The impairment charge resulted from changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the end-markets served by residential water treatment components.

Identifiable intangible assets

Our
primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks and trade names, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships. Identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable
intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. We complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter each year for those identifiable assets not subject
to amortization. There was no impairment charge recorded in 2011 or 2010 for identifiable intangible assets. An impairment charge of $11.3 million was recorded in 2009, related to trade names. These charges were recorded in

Selling, general and
administrative

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name
with its carrying value. Fair value is measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This
method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted average cost of capital. The impairment charge recorded in 2009 was the result of significant declines in sales volume.

At December 31, 2011 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $2,866.2 million and represented approximately 62.5% of
our total assets. If we experience future declines in sales and operating profit or do not



meet our operating forecasts, we may be subject to future impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses, increases in the discount rate used
to determine the discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any
future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Impairment of long-lived assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes
in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected
future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and
carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash
flows and the fair value of long-lived assets. There were no impairment charges recorded related to long-lived assets in 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and
foreign defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations.
Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in
ITEM 8, Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these assumptions will affect pension expense, pension contributions and the funded status of our pension plans.

We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in our Consolidated Balance
Sheets, with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur.

Discount rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on
our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions.
This produced a discount rate for our U.S. plans of 5.05% in 2011, 5.90% in 2010 and 6.00% in 2009. The discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 0.75% to 5.00% in 2011, 0.75% to 5.40% in 2010 and 2.00% to 6.00% in 2009. There are no
other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2012.

Expected rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2011 and 8.5% in 2010 and 2009. The expected rate of return is designed to be a
long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable year-to-year variance from actual returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns, with consideration given to forecasted economic
conditions, our asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader longer-term market indices.

We base our determination of
pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains
or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes
gains or losses over a five-year-period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

See
ITEM 8, Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding pension plans.



ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are
exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes in interest rates. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are
major financial institutions. All instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes. The major accounting policies and utilization of these instruments is described more fully in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements.

Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement.
In this case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus
..60% for $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position.

Interest rate risk

Our debt portfolio, excluding the impact of swap agreements, as of December 31, 2011, was comprised of debt predominantly denominated in
U.S. dollars. This debt portfolio is comprised of 69% fixed-rate debt and 31% variable-rate debt, not considering the effects of our interest rate swaps. Taking into account the variable to fixed-rate swap agreements we entered into with an
effective date of April 2006 and August 2007, our debt portfolio is comprised of 85% fixed-rate debt and 15% variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change
in interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash
flows but does not impact the net financial instrument position.

Based on the fixed-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, as of
December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would result in a $53.0 million increase or $58.0 million decrease in fair value.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, including the interest rate swap agreements, as of December 31, 2011, a 100 basis point increase or decrease in interest rates
would result in a $2.0 million increase or decrease in interest incurred.

Foreign currency risk

We conduct business in various locations throughout the world and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of foreign currencies in relation
to our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. We use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks. The functional currencies of our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the country of domicile. We manage these operating
activities at the local level and revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are generally denominated in local currencies, thereby mitigating the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange. However, our results of operations and assets and
liabilities are reported in U.S. dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the U.S. dollar. From time to time, we may enter in to short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge
foreign currency risks.



ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in
Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any
evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, management used the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of
the Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2011, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Management has excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Clean Process Technologies (“CPT”), which was
acquired on May 12, 2011 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 19 percent of total assets and 7 percent of total revenues on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011.

Our independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s
internal control over financial reporting as of year ended December 31, 2011. That attestation report is set forth immediately following this management report.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the internal
control over financial reporting of Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011 based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
Organizations of the Treadway Commission. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. As described in Management’s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Clean Process Technologies (“CPT”), which was acquired on May 12, 2011 and whose financial
statements constitute approximately 19 percent of total assets and 7 percent of total revenues on the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal
control over financial reporting at CPT. The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included
in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial
reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company's principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the company's board of directors, management, and other
personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal
control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;
(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being
made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that
could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting,
including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the
internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,
2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule listed in
the Index at Item 15 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2011 of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2012, expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule.



REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and financial statement schedule are the responsibility of
the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries
at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. Also, in our opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the Company’s internal
control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control—Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated
February 21, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31. We report our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles of consolidation

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and non-U.S., that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own
20% to 50% of the voting stock or have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and as a result, our share of the earnings or losses
of such equity affiliates is included in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Use of estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results
reported in future periods may be based upon amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policies that require our most significant estimates and judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue recognition

Generally,
we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery has occurred (depending on the terms of the sale); our price to the buyer is
fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold other than
warranty obligations in the normal and ordinary course of business. In the event significant post-shipment obligations were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Percentage of completion

Revenue from
certain long-term contracts is recognized over the contractual period under the percentage-of-completion (POC) method of accounting. Under this method, sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between the
actual costs incurred and the total estimated costs at completion. Changes to the original estimates may be required during the life of the contract and such estimates are reviewed on a regular basis. Sales and gross profit are adjusted using the
cumulative catch-up method for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values. These reviews have not resulted in adjustments that were significant to our results of operations. Estimated losses are recorded when identified. Claims
against customers are recognized as revenue upon settlement.

liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts included in

Prepaid expenses and other current assets

related to these contracts were $54.7 million and $0 at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Amounts included in

Other current liabilities

related to these contracts were $17.7 million and $0 at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Sales returns

The right of return may
exist explicitly or implicitly with our customers. Generally, our return policy allows for customer returns only upon our authorization. Goods returned must be product we continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of custom or
modified goods are normally not allowed. At the time of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect of returns. Estimated sales returns include consideration of historical sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical sales return levels
as a percent of sales, type of product, type of customer and a projection of this experience into the future.

Pricing and sales incentives

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions and
other volume-based incentives at the later of the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered. Sales incentives given to our customers are recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable benefit for the goods
or services in exchange for the consideration and (2) we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received. The following represents a description of our pricing arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives:

Pricing arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers and we record sales at the agreed-upon net selling price. However, one of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a percentage of the
original purchase price if they can demonstrate sales to a qualifying original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) customer. At the time of sale, we estimate the anticipated refund to be paid based on historical experience and reduce sales for
the probable cost of the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as cooperative advertising. Under our cooperative advertising
programs, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of sales as an allowance that may be used to advertise and promote our products. The customer is generally not required to provide evidence of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the
cost of this cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The cost of this program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer achieves a specified cumulative level of sales or sales increase. Under these
incentive programs, at the time of sale, we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least quarterly for each customer and sales are reduced for the anticipated cost of the rebate.
If the forecasted sales for a customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

Shipping and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling
are recorded in

Net sales

in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

Cost of goods sold

in the accompanying Consolidated
Statements of Income.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Research and development

We conduct research and development (“R&D”) activities in our own facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new products, product applications and manufacturing processes. We
expense R&D costs as incurred. R&D expenditures during 2011, 2010 and 2009 were $78.2 million, $67.2 million and $57.9 million, respectively.

Cash equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities of
three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts, reducing our receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers. Estimates used
in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience, current trends, aging of accounts receivable and periodic credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. We generally do not require
collateral. No customer receivable balances exceeded 10% of total net receivable balances as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
substantially all costed using the first-in, first-out (“FIFO”) method and with an insignificant amount of inventories located outside the United States costed using a moving average method which approximates FIFO.

Property, plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost. We compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful
lives:

Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in
circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future
pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate
future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets. There was no impairment charge recorded related to long-lived assets.

Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the net of
the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased and liabilities assumed.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting
unit, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit there is an indication that goodwill impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill
impairment, if any, that should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value of
goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation.

The fair value
of each reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected capital expenditures,
changes in working capital and the appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are similar in size and industry. Actual results may differ from those used in our
valuations. This non-recurring fair value measurement is a “Level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy described below.

In developing our discounted cash flow analysis, assumptions about future revenues and expenses, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, are
based on our annual operating plan and long-term business plan for each of our reporting units. These plans take into consideration numerous factors including historical experience, anticipated future economic conditions, changes in raw material
prices and growth expectations for the industries and end markets we participate in. These assumptions are determined over a five year long-term planning period. The five year growth rates for revenues and operating profits vary for each reporting
unit being evaluated. Revenues and operating profit beyond 2018 are projected to grow at a perpetual growth rate between 3.0% and 3.5%.

Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future cash flows of the respective
reporting unit and our weighted-average cost of capital. We utilized discount rates ranging from 12.6% to 14% in determining the discounted cash flows in our fair value analysis.

In estimating fair value using the market approach, we identify a group of comparable publicly-traded companies for each operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product offering. These
groups of comparable companies are used to develop multiples based on total market-based invested capital as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). We determine our estimated values by applying these
comparable EBITDA multiples to the operating results of our reporting units. The ultimate fair value of each reporting unit is determined considering the results of both valuation methods.

Impairment charge

In the fourth quarter of 2011, we completed our annual goodwill
impairment review. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax non-cash impairment charge of $200.5. This represents impairment of goodwill in our Residential Filtration reporting unit, part of Water & Fluid Solutions. The impairment charge resulted from
changes in our forecasts in light of economic conditions prevailing in these markets and due to continued softness in the end-markets served by residential water treatment components.

Identifiable intangible assets

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade
marks and trade names, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships. Identifiable intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized.
Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. We
completed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization. There was no impairment charge recorded in 2011 or 2010 for identifiable intangible assets. An impairment charge of $11.3
million was recorded in 2009, related to trade names. These charges were recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the trade name with its carrying value. Fair value is measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method assumes the trade name
has value to the extent that their owner is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits received from them. This method requires us to estimate the future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty rate and the weighted
average cost of capital. This non-recurring fair value measurement is a “Level 3” measurement under the fair value hierarchy described below.

At December 31, 2011 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately $2,866 million and represented approximately 62.5% of our total assets. If we experience further declines in sales and
operating profit or do not meet our operating forecasts, we may be subject to future impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses, increases in the discount rate used to determine the
discounted cash flows of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price or the market as a whole could result in additional impairment indicators. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of
these assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Equity and cost method investments

We have investments that are accounted for using the equity method. Our proportionate share of income or losses from investments accounted for under the
equity method is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. This requires
significant judgment, including assessment of the investees’ financial condition and in certain cases the possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the investees’ historical and projected results of operations and cash
flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from projections, we may incur future charges for the impairment of these investments.

We have a 50% investment in FARADYNE Motors LLC (“FARADYNE”), a joint venture with Xylem, Inc. (fka ITT Water Technologies, Inc) that designs, develops and manufactures submersible pump motors.
We do not consolidate the investment in our consolidated financial statements as we do not have a controlling interest over the investment. There were investments in and loans to FARADYNE of $6.0 million and $6.1 million at December 31,
2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively, which is net of our proportionate share of the results of their operations.

Investments for
which we do not have significant influence are accounted for under the cost method. At December 31, 2011 and 2010 the aggregate balance of these investments was $6.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively.

Income taxes

We use the asset
and liability approach to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is
enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances from period to
period are included in our tax provision in the period of change. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount
that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

Environmental

We recognize environmental clean-up liabilities on an undiscounted
basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental clean-up is estimated by engineering, financial and legal specialists based on current
law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) will be able to fulfill their commitments
at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and severally liable. The process of estimating environmental clean-up liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a
contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty as to what remedy and technology will be required and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or regulations,
advances in clean-up technologies and additional information about the ultimate clean-up remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in

Other current liabilities

and

Other non-current liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property, workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly-owned
captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, reserves for policy claims were
$44.3 million ($13.3 million included in

Accrued product claims and warranties

and $31.0 million included in

Other non-current liabilities

) and $49.0 million ($12.0 million included in

Accrued product claims
and warranties

and $37.0 million included in

Other non-current liabilities

), respectively.

Stock-based compensation

We account for stock-based compensation awards on a fair value basis. The estimated grant date fair value of each option award is
recognized in income on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The estimated fair value of each option award is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. From time to time, we have
elected to modify the terms of the original grant. These modified grants are accounted for as a new award and measured using the fair value method, resulting in the inclusion of additional compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of
Income. Restricted share awards and units are recorded as compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods based on the market value on the date of grant.

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net
income attributable to Pentair, Inc., by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income attributable to Pentair, Inc., by the weighted-average number of common shares
outstanding including the dilutive effects of common stock equivalents. The dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock awards and units increased weighted average common shares outstanding by 1,519 thousand, 1,257 thousand and
1,107 thousand in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common shares were 2,140 thousand, 3,711 thousand and 5,283 thousand in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Derivative financial instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those
embedded in other contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized
in earnings. If the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income
when the hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge becomes ineffective, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. For
a derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are reported in earnings immediately.

We use
derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All other
contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also meet the requirements of and have been designated as, normal purchases or sales. Our policy is not to enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal
purchases or sales. From time to time, we may enter in to short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency risks.

Fair value measurements

Fair
value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified using
the following hierarchy, which is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement date:

Level 1:

Valuation is based on observable inputs such as quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or
liabilities in active markets.

Level 2:

Valuation is based on inputs such as quoted market prices for
similar assets or liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3:

Valuation is based upon other unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.

In making fair value measurements, observable market data must be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within
different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

Foreign currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located
outside of the U.S. are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at average
monthly rates of exchange. The resultant translation adjustments are included in

Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)

(“AOCI”), a separate component of shareholders’ equity.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

New accounting standards

In May 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued authoritative guidance to improve the consistency of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements between US GAAP
and International Financial Reporting Standards. The provisions of this guidance change certain of the fair value principles related to the highest and best use premise, the consideration of blockage factors and other premiums and discounts, and the
measurement of financial instruments held in a portfolio and instruments classified within shareholders' equity. Further, the guidance provides additional disclosure requirements surrounding Level 3 fair value measurements, the uses of
nonfinancial assets in certain circumstances and identification of the level in the fair value hierarchy used for assets and liabilities which are not recorded at fair value, but where fair value is disclosed. This guidance is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. We are evaluating the potential impact of adoption.

In June 2011, the FASB
issued authoritative guidance surrounding the presentation of comprehensive income, with an objective of increasing the prominence of items reported in OCI. This guidance provides entities with the option to present the total of comprehensive
income, the components of net income and the components of OCI in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. In addition, entities must present on the face of the financial statement,
items reclassified from OCI to net income in the section of the financial statement where the components of net income and OCI are presented, regardless of the option selected to present comprehensive income. This guidance is effective for fiscal
years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The FASB subsequently deferred the effective date of certain provisions of this standard pertaining to the reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income,
pending the issuance of further guidance on that matter. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

In September 2011, the FASB issued an amendment to an existing accounting standard, which provides entities an option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment
testing on goodwill is necessary. Specifically, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the current two-step test. If an entity believes, as a result of
its qualitative assessment, that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the quantitative impairment test is required. Otherwise, no further testing is required. This
guidance is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2011. We believe that the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our financial
condition or results of operations.

Subsequent events

In connection with preparing the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011, we have evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure through
the date of this filing.

2.

Acquisitions

In May 2011, we acquired as part of Water & Fluid Solutions, the CPT division of privately held Norit Holding
B.V. for $715.3 million (€502.7 million translated at the May 12, 2011 exchange rate). CPT’s results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. CPT is a global leader in
membrane solutions and clean process technologies in the high growth water and beverage filtration and separation segments. CPT provides sustainable purification systems and solutions for desalination, water reuse, industrial applications and
beverage segments that effectively address the increasing challenges of clean water scarcity, rising energy costs and pollution. CPT’s product offerings include innovative ultrafiltration and nanofiltration membrane technologies, aseptic
valves, CO


recovery and control systems and specialty
pumping equipment. Based in the Netherlands, CPT has broad sales diversity with the majority of 2011 and 2010 revenues generated in European Union and Asia-Pacific countries.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

The fair value of the business acquired was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value acquired over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is reflected as goodwill. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was $451.8 million, none
of which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $197.2 million, including definite-lived intangibles, such as customer relationships and proprietary technology with a weighted average amortization
period of approximately 10 years.

The total purchase price has been allocated to the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed as follows:

CPT’s net sales and income from continuing operations for the period from the acquisition date to December 31,
2011 were $234.1 million and $2.4 million, respectively, and include $13.2 million of non-recurring expenses for acquisition date fair value adjustments related to inventory and customer backlog.

The following pro forma consolidated condensed financial results of operations are presented as if the acquisitions described above had been completed at
the beginning of the comparable period:

The 2010 unaudited pro forma net income was adjusted to include the impact of approximately $12.9 million in
non-recurring items related to acquisition date fair value adjustments to inventory and customer backlog. The 2011 unaudited pro forma net income was adjusted to exclude the impact of these items. Acquisition-related transaction costs of
approximately $8.0 million associated with the CPT acquisition were excluded from the pro forma net income in the 2011 period presented and included in the 2010 period presented.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

These pro forma condensed consolidated financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes
only and include certain adjustments, such as increased interest expense on acquisition debt. They do not reflect the effect of costs or synergies that would have been expected to result from the integration of the acquisition. The pro forma
information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the combination occurred at the beginning of each period presented, or of future results of the consolidated entities.

In January 2011 we acquired as part of Water & Fluid Solutions, all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Hidro Filtros do Brasil
(“Hidro Filtros”) for cash of $14.9 million and a note payable of $2.1 million. The Hidro Filtros results of operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition. Hidro Filtros is a leading
manufacturer of water filters and filtering elements for residential and industrial applications operating in Brazil and neighboring countries. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was $10.1 million, none of which is tax
deductible. Identified intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $6.3 million including definite-lived intangibles, primarily customer relationships of $5.5 million, with an estimated life of 13 years. The proforma impact of this
acquisition was deemed to be not material.

Additionally, during 2011, we completed other small acquisitions with purchase prices totaling
$4.6 million, consisting of $2.9 million in cash and $1.7 million as a note payable, adding to Water & Fluid Solutions. Total goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price allocation was $4.3 million, none of which is tax deductible. The
proforma impact of these acquisitions was deemed to be not material.

Total transaction costs related to acquisition activities for the year
ended December 31, 2011 were $8.2 million, which were expensed as incurred and recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

3.

Discontinued Operations

In 2010, we were notified of a product recall required by our former Tools Group (which was sold to Black and Decker Corporation in
2004 and treated as a discontinued operation). Under the terms of the sale agreement we are liable for a portion of the product recall costs. We recorded a liability of $3.2 million ($2.0 million net of tax) in 2010 representing our estimate of the
potential cost for products sold prior to the date of sale of the Tools Group associated with this recall. In addition, we received the remaining escrow balances from our sale of Lincoln Industrial of approximately $0.5 million, and we reversed tax
reserves of approximately $1.0 million due to the expiration of various statues of limitations.

4.

Restructuring

During 2011, we announced and initiated certain business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost structure and
realigning our business. These initiatives included the reduction in hourly and salaried headcount of approximately 210 employees, which included 160 in Water & Fluid Solutions and 50 in Technical Products.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Restructuring related costs included in

Selling, general and administrative

expenses on the
Consolidated Statements of Income include costs for severance and other restructuring costs as follows:

Total restructuring costs related to Water & Fluid Solutions and Technical Products were $11.0 million and $2.0
million, respectively, for year ended December 31, 2011.

Restructuring accrual activity recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is
summarized as follows:

Debt

Debt and the average interest rates on debt outstanding are summarized as follows:

In May 2011, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.00% Senior Notes due 2021
(the “Notes”). The Notes are guaranteed by certain of our wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries that are also guarantors under our primary bank credit facility. We used the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes to finance in part the
CPT acquisition.

In April 2011, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit
Facility replaced our previous $800 million revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility creates an unsecured, committed credit facility of up to $700 million, with multi-currency sub facilities to support investments outside the U.S. The Credit
Facility expires on April 28, 2016. Borrowings under the Credit Facility currently bear interest at the rate of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 1.75%. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility will vary based on our
credit ratings. We used borrowings under the Credit Facility to fund a portion of the CPT acquisition and to fund ongoing operations.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Total availability under our existing Credit Facility was $528.0 million as of December 31, 2011,
which was limited to $480.3 million by the leverage ratio financial covenant in the credit agreement.

Our debt agreements contain certain
financial covenants, the most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and non-cash compensation expense, as defined) that
may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0 as of the last date of each of our fiscal quarters thereafter. We were in compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements as of December 31, 2011.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have various other credit facilities with an aggregate availability of $74.2 million, of which $14.1 million was
outstanding at December 31, 2011. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest at variable rates.

We have $105 million of
outstanding private placement debt maturing in May 2012. We classified this debt as long-term as of December 31, 2011 as we have the intent and ability to refinance such obligation on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

In March 2009, we announced the redemption of all of our remaining outstanding $133.9 million aggregate principal of our 7.85% Senior Notes due 2009.
These notes were redeemed on April 15, 2009 at a redemption price of $1,035.88 per $1,000 of principal outstanding plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a loss of $4.8 million on early extinguishment of
debt in the second quarter of 2009. The loss included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of $0.3 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of $5.0 million related to the
redemption and other costs associated with the purchase.

Debt outstanding at December 31, 2011 matures on a calendar year basis as
follows:

As part of the CPT acquisition, we assumed a capital lease obligation related to land and buildings. As of
December 31, 2011 we had a cost of $22.7 million, and accumulated amortization of $5.1 million, all of which are included in

Property, plant and equipment

on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The present value of future minimum lease payments is the total future minimum lease payments of $17.9 million less the imputed interest of $2.1 million.

Derivatives and Financial Instruments

Cash-flow hedges

In August 2007, we entered into a $105 million interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to exchange variable rate interest payment
obligations for a fixed rate obligation without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. The effective date of the swap was August 30, 2007. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of
4.89% and expires in May 2012. The fixed interest rate of 4.89% plus the .50% interest rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective fixed interest rate of 5.39%. The fair value of the swap was a liability of $1.7 million and $6.4 million
at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively and was recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

In September 2005, we entered into a $100 million interest rate swap agreement with several major
financial institutions to exchange variable-rate interest payment obligations for fixed-rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. The effective date of the fixed-rate swap
was April 25, 2006. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.68% and expires in July 2013. The fixed interest rate of 4.68% plus the .60% interest rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective fixed interest rate of 5.28%. The fair
value of the swap was a liability of $6.3 million and $9.4 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively and was recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps are recorded as assets or liabilities on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized income/expense is included in AOCI and realized income/expense and amounts due to/from swap counterparties, are included in earnings. We realized incremental interest expense resulting from the swaps of $9.3
million and $9.2 million at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps
are designated as and are effective as cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps are recorded as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in their fair value included in OCI. Derivative gains and losses included
in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest expense is recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs.

Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement. In this case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable interest payments
per the underlying debt agreements which are at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus .60% for $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all of our swap counterparties would
not eliminate our obligation to continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if we continue to be in a net pay position.

At
December 31, 2011 and 2010, our interest rate swaps are carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis. Fair values are determined through the use of models that consider various assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as
other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy.

Foreign currency
contract

In March 2011, we entered into a foreign currency option contract to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the euro related
to the planned CPT acquisition. The contract had a notional amount of €286.0 million, a strike price of 1.4375 and a maturity date of May 13, 2011. In May 2011, we sold the foreign currency option contract for $1.0 million. The net
cost of $2.1 million is recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

on the Consolidated Statements on Income.

At December 31,
2010 we had a euro to U.S. dollar contract that expired on January 7, 2011 with a notional amount of $132.5 million. The fair value of the contract was an asset of $1.2 million.

We manage our economic and transaction exposure to certain market-based risks through the use of foreign currency derivative instruments. Our objective in holding derivatives is to reduce the volatility
of net earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Fair value of financial instruments

In April 2011, as part of our planned debt issuance to fund the CPT acquisition, we entered into interest rate swap contracts to hedge movement in
interest rates through the expected date of closing for a portion of the expected fixed rate debt offering. The swaps had a notional amount of $400 million with an average interest rate of 3.65%. In May 2011, upon the sale of the Notes, the swaps
were terminated at a cost of $11.0 million. Because we used the contracts to hedge future interest payments, this amount is recorded in

Prepaid expenses and other current assets

within the Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized as
interest exposure over the life of the Notes.

The recorded amounts and estimated fair values of long-term debt, excluding the effects of
derivative financial instruments and the recorded amounts and estimated fair value of those derivative financial instruments were as follows:

The following methods were used to estimate the fair values of each class of financial instrument measured on a recurring
basis:

•

short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable and variable-rate
debt) — recorded amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity period;

•

long-term fixed-rate debt, including current maturities — fair value is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt with similar
terms, which are inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined by the accounting guidance; and

•

interest rate swaps and foreign currency contract agreements — fair values are determined through the use of models that consider various
assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined by the accounting guidance.

Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Deferred compensation plan assets include mutual funds and cash equivalents for payment of certain non-qualified benefits for retired, terminated and active employees.
The fair value of these assets was based on quoted market prices.

11.

Income Taxes

Income from continuing operations before income taxes and noncontrolling interest consisted of the
following:

The provision for income taxes for continuing operations consisted of the following:

Reconciliation of the U.S. statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for continuing operations follows:



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Reconciliation of the beginning and ending gross unrecognized tax
benefits follows:

Included in the $26.5 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 was
$24.5 million of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2011 may decrease by a range of $0 to $18.7 million
during the next twelve months primarily as a result of the resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of limitations.

The determination of annual income tax expense takes into consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) has examined our
U.S. federal income tax returns through 2003 with no material adjustments. The IRS has also completed a survey of our 2004 U.S. federal income tax return with no material findings. The IRS is currently examining our federal tax returns for
years 2005 through 2009. No material adjustments have been proposed, however, actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.

We record
penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in

Provision for income taxes

and

Interest expense

, respectively, which is consistent with our past practices. As of December 31, 2011, we had recorded approximately
$0.9 million for the possible payment of penalties and $5.9 million related to the possible payment of interest expense.

U.S.
income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so. As of December 31,
2011, approximately $261.1 million of unremitted earnings attributable to international subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely invested. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable if such earnings were to
be remitted.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
“temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets” (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities”
(generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the tax impact has not yet been recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income).

Deferred taxes were classified in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and
liabilities are as follows:

Included in Other, net in the table above are deferred tax assets of $3.3 million and $2.3 million as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively, related to a foreign tax credit carryover from the tax period ended December 31, 2006 and related to state net operating losses. The foreign tax credit is eligible for carryforward until the tax
period ending December 31, 2016.

Non-U.S. tax losses of $82.3 million and $49.6 million were available for carryforward
at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A valuation allowance reflected above in Other, net of $11.7 million and $9.4 million exists for deferred income tax benefits related to the non-U.S. loss carryforwards available as of
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively that may not be realized. We believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective countries to allow us to fully recover the remainder of the tax losses. The non-U.S. operating
losses are subject to varying expiration periods and will begin to expire in 2012. State tax losses of $69.2 million and $69.3 million were available for carryforward at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. A valuation allowance
reflected above in Other, net of $1.5 million and $2.4 million exists for deferred income tax benefits related to the carryforwards available at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Certain state tax losses will expire in 2012,
while others are subject to carryforward periods of up to twenty years.

12.

Benefit Plans

Pension and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based principally on an employee’s years of service and/or compensation levels near
retirement. In addition, we also provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a December 31 measurement
date each year. In December 2007, we announced that we will be freezing certain pension plans as of December 31, 2017.

Obligations and funded status

The following tables present reconciliations of the benefit obligation of the plans, the plan assets of the pension plans and the funded status of the plans:

Of the $241.8 million under funding at December 31, 2011, $137.9 million relates to foreign pension plans
and our supplemental executive retirement plans which are not commonly funded.

Amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets are as
follows:

The accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit plans was $625.9 million and $557.7 million at
December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Assumptions

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine domestic benefit obligations at December 31 are as follows:

Weighted-average assumptions used to determine the domestic net periodic benefit cost for years ending December 31
are as follows:

Discount rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions. This produced a discount rate for our U.S. plans of 5.05%
in 2011, 5.90% in 2010 and 6.00% in 2009. The discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 0.75% to 5.00% in 2011, 0.75% to 5.40% in 2010 and 2.00% to 6.00% in 2009. There are no other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption
that will impact our pension expense in 2012.

Expected rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.0% for 2011 and 8.5%, 2010 and 2009. The expected rate of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable year-to-year
variance from actual returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns, with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
longer-term market indices. In 2011, the pension plan assets yielded returns of 7.8% and returns of 11.2% and 19.5% in 2010 and 2009. Our expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is 7.5% for 2012.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which
reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five- year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected
return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year-period, the future value of assets
will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Unrecognized pension and post-retirement losses

As of our December 31, 2011 measurement date, our plans have $186.1 million of cumulative unrecognized losses. To the extent the unrecognized
losses, when adjusted for the difference between market and market related values of assets, exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, it will be amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected
future-working lifetime of active participants (currently approximating 12 years).

The assumed health care cost trend rates at
December 31 are as follows:

The assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A
one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan assets

Objective

The primary objective of our investment strategy is to meet the pension
obligation to our employees at a reasonable cost to us. This is primarily accomplished through growth of capital and safety of the funds invested. The plans will therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital over inflation through
appreciation of securities held and through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and interest income.

Asset allocation

Our actual overall asset allocation for the plans as compared to our investment policy goals is as follows:

While the target allocations do not have a percentage allocated to cash, the plan assets will always include some cash
due to cash flow requirements.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

As part of our strategy to reduce U.S. pension plan funded status volatility, we plan to increase
the allocation to long duration fixed income securities in future years as the funded status of our U.S. pension plans improve. In 2011 we increased our fixed income investments from 40% to 50% and from 30% to 40% in 2010.

Fair value measurement

The following
table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Valuation methodologies used for investments measured at fair value are as follows:

•

Cash equivalents:

Consist of investments in commingled funds valued based on observable market data. Such investments are classified
as Level 2.

•

Fixed income:

Investments in corporate bonds, government securities, mortgages and asset backed securities are value based upon

Cash flows

Contributions

Pension contributions totaled $37.1 million and $49.8 million in
2011 and 2010, respectively. Our 2012 required pension contributions are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $45 million. The 2012 expected contributions will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements.

Estimated future benefit payments

The
following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid by the plans as follows:

Savings plan

We have a 401(k) plan (“the plan”) with an employee stock ownership (“ESOP”) bonus component, which covers certain union and nearly all non-union U.S. employees who meet certain
age requirements. Under the plan, eligible U.S. employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation. We match contributions made by employees who meet certain eligibility and service requirements. Our matching
contribution is 100% of eligible employee contributions for the first 1% of eligible compensation and 50% of the next 5% of eligible compensation. In June 2009, we temporarily suspended the company match of the plan and ESOP. We reinstated the
company match in 2010.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet certain service requirements receive a discretionary
ESOP contribution equal to 1.5% of annual eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the plan and ESOP was approximately
$15.8 million, $11.0 million and $6.7 million, in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Other retirement compensation

Total other accrued retirement compensation was $12.6 million and $13.9 million in 2011 and 2010, respectively and is
included in the

Pension and other retirement compensation

line of our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

13.

Shareholders’ Equity

Authorized shares

We
may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock with
authorization to issue up to 2.5 million shares, Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share. No shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.

Purchase rights

On
December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock. The dividend was payable upon the close of business on January 28, 2005
to the shareholders of record upon the close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

entitles the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a price of $240.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless certain change in control events occur, such as a person acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. The description and
terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement, dated December 10, 2004. The Rights will expire on January 28, 2015, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or exchanged in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement. On
January 28, 2005, the common share purchase rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated July 31, 1995 were redeemed in their entirety for an amount equal to $0.0025 per right.

Share repurchases

In July 2010, the
Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. As of December 31, 2010 we had repurchased 734,603 shares for $25 million pursuant to this plan. In December 2010, the Board
of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had repurchased 389,300 shares for $12.5 million pursuant to this authorization, which expired in
December 2011. In December 2011, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25 million. This authorization expires in December 2012.

14.

Stock Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $19.5 million, $21.5 million and $17.3 million,
respectively.

Omnibus stock incentive plans

In May 2008, the 2008 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended and Restated (the “2008 Plan” or the “Plan”) was approved by shareholders. The 2008 Plan authorizes the issuance of
additional shares of our common stock and extends through February 2018. The 2008 Plan allows for the granting of nonqualified stock options; incentive stock options; restricted shares; restricted stock units; dividend equivalent units; stock
appreciation rights; performance shares; performance units; and other stock based awards.

The Plan is administered by our Compensation
Committee (the “Committee”), which is made up of independent members of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards under the Plan are managerial, administrative or other key employees who are in a position to make a
material contribution to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards, establish certain terms and conditions of award
grants and take certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan restricts the Committee’s authority to reprice awards or to cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

The Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders in 2004 (the “2004 Plan”) expired upon approval of the 2008 Plan by shareholders. Prior grants made under the 2004 Plan and earlier
stock incentive plans remained outstanding on the terms in effect at the time of grant.

Non-qualified and incentive stock options

Under the Plan, we may grant stock options to any eligible employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares on
the dates the options were granted. Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date. Annual expense for the fair value of stock options was $8.9 million in 2011,
$10.7 million in 2010 and $7.1 million in 2009.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Restricted shares and restricted stock units

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded restricted shares or restricted stock units (awards) of our common stock. Share awards generally vest from
two to five years after issuance, subject to continuous employment and certain other conditions. Restricted share awards are valued at market value on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period. Annual expense for the fair value of
restricted shares and restricted stock units was $10.6 million in 2011, $10.8 million in 2010 and $10.2 million in 2009.

Stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units

Under the Plan, the Committee is permitted to issue these awards which are generally earned over a three-year vesting period and are tied to specific financial metrics.

Outside directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options were granted to outside directors under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the “Directors Plan”) with an exercise price equal to the market value of
the shares on the option grant dates. Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors Plan expired in January 2008. Prior grants remain outstanding on the terms in
effect at the time of grant.

Non-employee Directors are also eligible to receive awards under the 2008 Plan. Director awards are made by our
Governance Committee, which is made up of independent members of our Board of Directors.

Stock options

The following table summarizes stock option activity under all plans:

The weighted-average grant date fair value of options granted in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was estimated to be $9.98, $9.47 and
$5.09 per share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options that were exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $10.9 million, $7.4 million and $5.2 million, respectively. At December 31, 2011, the total unrecognized
compensation cost related to stock options was $5.3 million. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.4 years.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

We estimated the fair values using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, modified for dividends and
using the following assumptions:

Cash received from option exercises for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $14.7 million,
$14.9 million and $8.2 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from option exercises totaled $4.1 million, $2.8 million and $1.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010
and 2009, respectively.

Restricted share awards

The following table summarizes restricted share award activity under all plans:

As of December 31, 2011, there was $16.4 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted share
compensation arrangements granted under the 2004 Plan and the 2008 Plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.0 years. The total fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2011,
2010 and 2009, was $10.2 million, $12.7 million and $5.5 million, respectively. The actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from restricted share compensation arrangements totaled $3.6 million, $3.4 million and
$2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Business Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following business segments based primarily on types of products offered and markets
served:

•

Water & Fluid Solutions

— manufactures and markets essential products and systems used in the movement, storage,
treatment and enjoyment of water. Products include water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Technical Products

— designs, manufactures and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that house and protect
sensitive electronics and electrical components and protect the people that use them. Applications served include industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense
and general electronics. Products include mild steel, stainless steel, aluminum and non-metallic enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes and associated thermal management systems.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

•

Other

— is primarily composed of unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance subsidiary, intermediate finance
companies and divested operations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same as those described in the
summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and operating income of the segments and use a variety of ratios to measure performance. These results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

Financial information by
reportable business segment is included in the following summary:

(1)

All cash and cash equivalents are included in Other

Net sales are based on the location in which the sale originated. Long-lived assets represent property, plant and equipment, net of related depreciation.

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple markets and customers for which we do not have the information systems to track revenues by
primary product category. However, our net sales by segment are representative of our sales by major product category.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

We sell our products through various distribution channels including wholesale and retail distributors,
original equipment manufacturers and home centers. In Water & Fluid Solutions, one customer accounted for approximately 10% of segment sales in 201l and 2010 and no single customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in 2009. In
Technical Products, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRPs in a small number of environmental clean-ups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de minimis

status. To date,
none of these claims have resulted in clean-up costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses in the past and in certain cases, such as the
disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the Tools Group in
2004, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years; to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relates to operations no longer carried
out at the sites. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter is probable and it is
possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental liabilities
were approximately $1.5 million and $1.3 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental clean-up costs and liabilities will not
exceed the amount of our current reserves.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes, product
liability, environmental, safety and health, patent infringement and employment matters.

We record liabilities for an estimated loss from a
loss contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress after the date of the financial statements but before the issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of legal counsel and (d) management’s intended response to
the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material impact on our
consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
result in future charges that could have a material impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based
on experience and developments in litigation. As a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the proceedings and claims could change in the future.

Product liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive insurance subsidiary.
Penwald records a liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the
amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. In 2004, we disposed of the Tools Group and we retained responsibility for certain
product claims. We have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims.

Warranties and guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or
product lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or other obligations. The subject matter, amounts and duration
of any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the
overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a
material effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

We recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair
value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products. Liability under
service and warranty policies is based upon a review of historical warranty and service claim experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience warrant.



Pentair, Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements

The changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties for the years ended
December 31, 2011 and 2010 were as follows:

Stand-by letters of credit and bonds

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of
our projects in process and in our backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties under self-insurance programs. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the
outstanding value of these instruments totaled $136.2 million and $116.5 million, respectively.
