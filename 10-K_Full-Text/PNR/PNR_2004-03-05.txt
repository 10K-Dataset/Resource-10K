RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Growth of our business

We continually look at each of our
businesses to determine whether they fit with our evolving strategic vision. Our primary focus is on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities. We seek growth through product and service innovation, market expansion, and
acquisitions. Acquisitions have played an important part in the growth of our business and will continue to be an important part of our growth in the future.

Recent announcements

On February 3, 2004, we entered into an
agreement to acquire WICOR Inc. (“WICOR”), a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. WICOR, which manufactures water system, filtration, and pool equipment products under the Sta-Rite, SHURflo, and Hypro brands,
generated sales of approximately $746 million in 2003. The $850 million cash transaction, which we plan to complete in the second or third quarter of 2004, is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and regulatory approvals. As part of
the transaction, we will assume approximately $24 million of WICOR debt.

We
also announced that we have engaged Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for our Tools Segment, comprising the Porter-Cable, Delta, DeVilbiss Air Power Company, Oldham Saw, and Flex businesses with $1,081.4 million in net sales in 2003.

Acquisitions

On December 31, 2003, we acquired all of the common stock of Everpure, Inc. (Everpure), from United States Filter Corporation, a unit of Veolia Environnement, for $217.3
million in cash, including cash acquired of $5.5 million. Everpure is a manufacturer of water filtration products for the commercial and consumer sectors and they generated approximately $60 million in net sales for fiscal 2003.

During 2003, we also completed four product line acquisitions in our Water segment for total
consideration of $21.4 million in cash: Hydrotemp Manufacturing Co., Inc., Letro Products, Inc. and certain assets of TwinPumps, Inc. and K&M Plastics, Inc.

We have invested approximately $30.5 million to acquire a 49 percent interest in the joint venture operations of a long time Asian supplier
for bench top power tools, of which $5.6 million was paid in 2003, $4.5 million was paid in 2002 and $20.4 million was paid in 2001. In February 2004, we signed a letter of intent to purchase the remaining 51 percent ownership interest in this
supplier.

On September 30, 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of
Plymouth Products, Inc. and affiliated entities (Plymouth Products) from USF Consumer & Commercial WaterGroup, a unit of Vivendi Environnement (now Veolia Environnement), for total consideration of $121.7 million in cash, including debt assumed
of $1.2 million. Plymouth Products is a manufacturer of water filtration products used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. In the first quarter of 2003, we received $1.9 million in purchase price adjustments relative to our
fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products. The adjustments primarily related to final determination of closing date net assets.

On October 1, 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of privately held Oldham Saw Co., Inc. and affiliated entities (Oldham Saw) for total consideration of $53.0
million cash, including debt assumed of $1.5 million and cash acquired of $1.7 million. Oldham Saw designs, manufactures, and markets router bits, circular saw blades, and related accessories for the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional power tool
markets.

These acquisitions were financed through available lines of credit,
supported by strong cash flow.

Also refer to ITEM 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.



Discontinued operations/divestitures

In December 2000, we adopted a plan to sell our Equipment segment businesses, Service Equipment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) and Lincoln Industrial, Inc. (Lincoln Industrial). In October 2001, we
completed the sale of the Service Equipment businesses to Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of $18.2 million. In December 2001, we completed the sale of Lincoln Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan), other
investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial for total consideration of $78.4 million, including a preferred stock interest. The selling price of Lincoln Industrial was subject to a final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in
January 2003, in which we paid Jordan $2.4 million. In the fourth quarter of 2003, we reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, primarily due to a reduction in estimated proceeds related to
exiting two remaining facilities.

Also refer to ITEM 7, Management’s
Discussion and Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

We classify our continuing operations into the following business segments:

Ÿ

Water

— manufactures and markets essential products and systems used in the movement, treatment, storage and enjoyment of water. Water segment products include
water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and pool and spa equipment and accessories.

Ÿ

Enclosures

— designs, manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components. Markets served include
industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks,
backplanes, and associated thermal management systems.

Ÿ

Tools

— designs, manufactures and markets power tool products positioned at the mid- to upper-end of the market and targets non-professional DIY, upscale
hobbyists, and professional end users. Tools segment products include woodworking machinery, portable power tools, power tool accessories, metal and stoneworking tools, pneumatic tools, compressors, generators, and pressure washers.

Ÿ

Other

— is primarily composed of unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations, and
intercompany eliminations.

Business segment and geographical
financial information is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

WATER SEGMENT

Strategy

Our Water segment strategies are to:

Ÿ

Capture opportunities and drive for break-through growth in filtration, pool, and water and wastewater systems;

Ÿ

Drive for double-digit profitable growth through improved service levels and aligning with key channel partners;

Ÿ

Create value by maximizing cash flow while achieving moderate growth through continued operational improvements;

Ÿ

Achieve low cost product development and sourcing platform by leveraging China/India; and

Ÿ

Accelerate bolt-ons and make strategic acquisitions.



Seasonality

We experience strong seasonal demand in our Water segment for pool and spa equipment products in the March through July time period, with some advance sales occurring in earlier months, which generally include extended payment terms. We
also experience increased sales in our pump group during droughts and heavy flooding in North America.

Competition

Our Water segment faces numerous competitors, some of which are larger, and have more resources.
Competition in commercial and residential pumps focuses on brand names, product performance, quality, and price. While home center and national retailers are important for residential lines of water and wastewater pumps, they are much less important
in commercial pumps. In municipal pumps, competition focuses on performance to meet required specifications, service, and price. Competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product performance and design, quality, delivery,
and price. In pool and spa equipment, there are a number of competitors. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We believe our existing distribution channels and reputation for
quality also contribute to our continuing industry penetration.

Customer
concentration

Information regarding significant customers in our Water segment is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated
Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

ENCLOSURES SEGMENT

Strategy

Our Enclosures segment strategies are to:

Ÿ

Increase sales volume by:

Ÿ

focusing on growing market segments;

Ÿ

pursuing strategic OEMs;

Ÿ

expanding into adjacent markets; and

Ÿ

globalization.

Ÿ

Lower our manufacturing cost by:

Ÿ

shifting manufacturing to low labor cost areas;

Ÿ

implementing PIMS enterprise practices; and

Ÿ

driving operational excellence.

Ÿ

Transform the product mix by:

Ÿ

increasing product innovation; and

Ÿ

targeting higher margin markets.

Seasonality

The Enclosure segment is not significantly
impacted by any seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the enclosures markets can be intense, particularly in telecom and datacom markets, where product design, prototyping, global
supply, and customer service are significant factors. The overall global decline in market demand over the last three years has created excess capacity throughout the industry. Despite the retrenchment of virtually all participants in these markets,
the need to generate fixed-cost absorption in this period of weakened demand has caused increased price competition in many markets. Our Enclosures segment has continued to focus on cost control and improving profitability on a sequential quarter to
quarter basis, while



many competitors have faced financial constraints and even bankruptcy stemming from significant volume declines. Recent growth in the Enclosures segment is a
result of continued channel penetration, growth in targeted market segments, new product development, and geographic expansion. Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are visible trends in the enclosures marketplace and typically play to the
strengths of a large and globally positioned supplier. We believe our Enclosures business has the broadest array of products available, as well as the capability to deploy them globally.

Customer concentration

Information regarding significant customers in our Enclosure segment is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

TOOLS SEGMENT

Strategy

Our Tools segment
strategies are to:

Ÿ

Reduce our overall cost structure by:

Ÿ

implementing PIMS enterprise practices;

Ÿ

utilizing low-cost manufacturing facilities; and

Ÿ

capturing supply management opportunities.

Ÿ

Leverage brands by:

Ÿ

accelerating market driven innovation;

Ÿ

reducing product development cycle time; and

Ÿ

instituting targeted reseller and user marketing programs.

Ÿ

Reinforce our multi-channel strategy by targeting under-penetrated channels.

Ÿ

Drive accessories growth.

Seasonality

We experience strong seasonal demand for our pressure washer product line in the March through
August time period. Demand for woodworking machinery, portable power tools, accessories, and compressors are strongest during spring, fall, and holiday promotional seasons. As a result, we typically experience stronger sales in the second and fourth
quarters and weaker sales in the first and third quarters. This seasonality also drives higher inventories and accounts receivable levels in the second and third quarters of each year.

Competition

The Tools segment
faces numerous competitors and strong distributors, many of which are larger and have more resources. Competition in the Tools segment has been intense and continues to increase, especially as these industries consolidate. Many competitors have
extensive product lines. We anticipate growth to come from existing channel customers, product development, and continued penetration of expanding market channels.

Competition at the end-user level focuses primarily on trade names, product performance and features, quality, service, and price. The
competition for shelf space at home centers and national retailers is particularly intense, demanding continuing product innovation, special inventory and delivery programs, and competitive pricing. Our strategy is to be the quality leader at a
competitive price in our selected markets. We believe our success in maintaining our position in the marketplace is primarily due to strong trade names, developing product feature innovations, new products, promotions, and productivity gains.

Customer concentration

Information regarding significant customers in our Tools segment is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form
10-K.



INFORMATION REGARDING ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Backlog

Our backlog of orders
from continuing operations as of December 31 by segment was:

The $32.5 million increase in Water
segment backlog was primarily due to the timing of orders in our pool business. The $5.7 million increase in Enclosures segment backlog was largely driven by the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations. The $19.0 million increase in Tools segment
backlog was primarily due to the timing of orders. We expect our backlog at December 31, 2003 will be filled in 2004.

Research and development

Research and development costs during
2003, 2002, and 2001 were $43.9 million, $36.9 million, and $31.2 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7, and in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Raw
materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel, plastic, electronic
components, plastics, and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of raw materials, some finished goods are purchased for distribution through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are purchased on the open market, and the majority are available through multiple
sources and are in adequate supply. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments, principally price commitments, for the purchase of various component parts and
raw materials and believe that it is unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices are available for most materials for which long-term commitments exist, and we believe that
the termination of any of these commitments would not have a material adverse effect on operations.

Certain commodities, such as steel, are subject to a degree of market and duty-driven price fluctuations. These fluctuations are managed through several mechanisms, including long-term agreements with escalator /
de-escalator clauses. Prices for raw materials, such as steel, are expected to trend higher in the future.

Distribution

We sell products through numerous distribution channels. Products are sold directly to users and
through numerous wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around the world.

Intellectual property

Patents, non-compete agreements,
proprietary technologies, customer relationships, trade marks, and trade names are important to our business. However, we do not regard our business as being materially dependent upon any single patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology,
customer relationship, trade mark, or trade name.



Employees

At
the end of 2003, we employed approximately 12,300 people worldwide. Total employees in the United States were approximately 9,450, of which approximately 1,200 were represented by trade unions having collective bargaining agreements. We consider our
employee relations to be very good.

Captive Insurance Subsidiary

We insure general and product liability, property, workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks through our regulated wholly owned
captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald Insurance Company (Penwald). Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this Form 10-K.

Available information

We make available free of charge (other than an investor’s own Internet access charges) through our Internet website (

http://www.pentair.com

) our Annual
Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and if applicable, amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the 1934 Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we
electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. Reports of beneficial ownership filed by our directors and executive officers pursuant to Section 16(a) of the 1934 Act are also available on our
website. We are not including the information contained on our website as part of, or incorporating it by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

Our
corporate office is located in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Manufacturing operations are carried out at approximately 22 plants located throughout the United States and at 17 plants located in 10 other countries. Through a 49 percent-owned joint
venture with a long time Asian tool supplier, we have an interest in three additional factories in Asia. In addition, we have approximately 23 warehouse facilities and numerous distribution facilities and sales offices. We also own or lease four
idle facilities.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for
their purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes, product liability, environmental, safety and
health, patent infringement, and employment matters.

Some of these lawsuits
and proceedings raise difficult and complex factual and legal issues, and are subject to many uncertainties, such as the facts and circumstances of the particular lawsuit, the jurisdiction and forum in which the lawsuit is pending and the applicable
law. We record liabilities in those instances where we can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability will likely arise.

We cannot always definitively determine possible liabilities that exceed recorded amounts related to the legal proceedings to which we are a party. There can be no
certainty that Pentair may not ultimately incur charges, whether related to products liability, antitrust, or other litigation, environmental matters, or other actions, in excess of presently recorded liabilities. However, we believe it is unlikely,
based upon the nature of the legal proceedings and our current knowledge of relevant facts and circumstances, that the possible liabilities exceeding the recorded amounts would be material individually or in the aggregate to our consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. With respect to product liability claims, such a conclusion about possible liabilities considers insurance coverage available for such liabilities.



While we believe that a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse
impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As a
result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental cleanups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten
years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, and the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in
2001, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we
believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities. We settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was adequate.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues concerning a limited number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition of
Essef Corporation in 1999, that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the
future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately $11.2 million, measured on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more
stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Product liability claims

As of February 8, 2004, we are
involved in approximately 152 product liability lawsuits and personal injury claims. We believe we have in place insurance coverage adequate for our needs. A substantial number of these lawsuits and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald. See
discussion in ITEM 1 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements – Insurance subsidiary. Accounting accruals covering the deductible portion of liability claims not covered by Penwald have been established and are
reviewed on a regular basis. We have not experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal injury claims.

Horizon litigation

Twenty-eight
separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs, a class action, and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise Lines, Inc. (Celebrity) were brought against Essef Corporation (Essef) and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition of Essef
in August 1999. These lawsuits alleged exposure to Legionnaires bacteria by passengers aboard the cruise ship M/V Horizon, a ship operated by Celebrity. The lawsuits included a class action brought on behalf of all passengers aboard the ship during
the relevant time period, individual “opt-out” passenger suits, and a suit by Celebrity. Celebrity alleged in its suit that it had sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the M/V Horizon while it was dry-docked.



The claims against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were based upon the allegation that Essef designed, manufactured,
and marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a part of the spa system on the Horizon, and allegations that the spa and filters contained bacteria that infected certain passengers on cruises from December 1993 through July 1994.

Prior to the acquisition of Essef, a settlement was reached in the class
action. With regard to the individual “opt out” passenger suits, the claims of one plaintiff were tried under a stipulation among all remaining parties provided that the liability findings would be applicable to all plaintiffs and
defendants. The trial resulted in a jury verdict on June 13, 2000 finding liability on the part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister company, Fantasia (together 30%). Compensatory damages in the total amount of $2.7 million
were awarded, with each defendant being accountable for its proportionate share of liability. The Essef defendant’s proportionate share was covered by insurance. Punitive damages were separately awarded against the Essef defendants in the total
amount of $7.0 million, with 60% awarded to all remaining plaintiffs and 40% to Celebrity.

After exhaustion of post-trial appeals, we paid all outstanding punitive damage awards of $7.0 million in the Horizon cases, plus interest of approximately $1.6 million in January 2004. We had reserved for the amount
of punitive damages awarded at the time of the Essef acquisition. A reserve for the $1.6 million interest cost was recorded in 2003.

All of the personal injury cases have now been resolved through either settlement or trial. The only remaining unresolved case is that brought by Celebrity for
interruption of its business. That case had been dormant, but was recently activated. One of Essef’s insurance carriers has issued a notice of rights letter. We believe we have reserves sufficient to cover the amount of any uninsured awards or
settlements.

Ellerbrake et al v. DeVilbiss Air Power Company

In August 2001, a national class action was brought against DeVilbiss Air Power Company (DAPC) and four other manufacturers of retail air
compressors on behalf of consumers that had purchased certain air compressors. Plaintiffs alleged that the manufacturers mislabeled horsepower ratings on compressors they manufacture. Plaintiffs sought to represent a class of all persons who had
purchased since August 1996 an air compressor for which the horsepower ratings were allegedly mislabeled.

Without admitting any liability, DAPC settled with plaintiffs and the settlement was preliminarily approved by the Court in January 2004. Terms of the settlement include changes in labeling, an education program for
consumers, attorney’s fees and tools or accessories for qualifying claimants. While certain elements of the settlement have specific dollars assigned to them, the ultimate cost of some elements is still unknown at this time. We believe reserves
recorded in 2003 are sufficient to cover the cost of this settlement based on the information available to us at this time.

ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA



ITEM 6.    SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA – (continued)

(1)

Effective January 1, 2002 we adopted SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. This standard requires goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite
life no longer be amortized. This standard did not require restatement of prior period amount to be consistent with the current year presentation and therefore, we have not made any adjustments to the historical financial information presented.
However, we have provided supplemental tax and diluted EPS information as we believe it is necessary to the understanding of our financial performance trend.

(2)

Calculated using a 13-month average.

In fiscal 2001, we discontinued our Equipment segment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive and Lincoln Industrial businesses). Historical financial information has been
adjusted to reflect this change. The 2001 results reflect a pre-tax loss on the sale of these businesses of $36.3 million ($24.6 million after tax, or $0.50 per share).

Capital expenditures in 2002 includes $23.0 million for the acquisition of a previously leased facility.

Cost of goods sold in 2001 includes $1.0 million related to the 2001 restructuring charge for
our Enclosures segment.

The 2000 results reflect a non-cash pre-tax cumulative
effect of accounting change related to revenue recognition that reduced income by $1.9 million ($1.2 million after tax, or $0.02 per share).

The 1997 results include a pre-tax gain on the sale of Federal Cartridge of $10.3 million ($1.2 million after tax, or $0.03 per share).

Reference should be made to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

This report contains statements that we believe to be “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such as “may,”

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturer
operating in three segments: Water, Enclosures, and Tools. Our Water segment manufactures and markets essential products and systems used in the movement, treatment, storage and enjoyment of water and generates approximately 39 percent of total
revenues. Our Enclosures segment accounts for approximately 21 percent of total revenues and designs, manufactures and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components for markets that include
industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics. Our Tools segment designs, manufactures and markets a wide range of power tools under
several well established trade names generating approximately 40 percent of total revenues.

Our Water segment has progressively become a more important part of our business portfolio with sales increasing from $100 million in 1995 to approximately $1 billion in 2003. We have identified target industry
segments totaling $50 billion, representing a small portion of the $350 billion global water market. We continue to capitalize on growth opportunities in the water industry as evidenced by four product line acquisitions in our Water segment in 2003
as well as the acquisition of Everpure on December 31, 2003. In February 2004, we announced our agreement to acquire WICOR, the completion of which would mark a dramatic shift in our water segment. We anticipate that the assimilation of these
acquisitions into our business operations will create a $2 billion business in the water industry.

Our Enclosures segment operates in a large global market with significant headroom in the industry niches such as defense, security, medical, and networking. We believe we have the largest industrial and commercial
distribution network in North America and highest brand recognition in the industry. During the past few years, the Enclosures segment experienced significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital spending in the industrial
market and over-capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets. However, this segment did experience growth in 2003 across the electrical and electronic markets and we believe it is well-positioned to continue improved performance. In
addition, through the success of our Pentair Integrated Management System (PIMS) and supply management initiatives we have increased Enclosures segment margins for the eighth sequential quarter.

Our Tools segment has been operating in a very competitive marketplace during the past few
years. Pricing pressures and higher raw material costs have caused our operating margins to decline. In February 2004, we announced our intent to explore strategic alternatives for our Tools segment. We will continue to operate the Tools segment for
the long-term and provide all appropriate management support and resources. We continue to seek opportunities to expand operating margins through cost reductions and productivity improvements as part of our PIMS initiatives. In addition, we plan to
continue to launch innovative new products and pursue significant incremental volume opportunities.

Key Trends and Uncertainties

The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial performance in
2003 and will likely impact our results in the future:

Ÿ

We have experienced a decrease in average selling prices and declines in operating margins in our Tools segment due to increased promotional programs. We expect these competitive
pressures to lessen somewhat, but still persist in 2004.

Ÿ

We expect all three segments to continue to benefit from our key initiatives, including supply management and PIMS.



Ÿ

Expenses related to downsizing are anticipated to continue as we identify more efficient means to manufacture and distribute our products.

Ÿ

Free cash flow, defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures, including both continuing and discontinued operations, exceeded $200 million for the second
straight year and is expected to exceed $200 million in 2004. See our discussion of

Other financial measures

under the caption “Liquidity and Capital Resources” of this report.

Ÿ

In 2003, we experienced favorable foreign currency effects, primarily for the U.S. dollar against the Euro, which may not trend favorably in the future.

Ÿ

Before any effects of our planned acquisition of WICOR, we expect our effective tax rate on continuing operations to be approximately 34 percent in 2004. Our ultimate effective tax
rate will depend on the timing of the planned WICOR acquisition and WICOR’s actual tax attributes.

Ÿ

Following the planned acquisition of WICOR, we will need to fund the repayment of our Bridge Facility by December 31, 2004 through a disposition of our Tools Group or through equity
issuance.

Business Transformation

On February 3, 2004, we entered into an agreement to acquire WICOR Inc. (“WICOR”), a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. WICOR, which
manufactures water system, filtration, and pool equipment products under the Sta-Rite, SHURflo, and Hypro brands, generated sales of approximately $746 million in 2003. The $850 million cash transaction, which we plan to complete in the second
or third quarter of 2004, is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and applicable regulatory approvals. As part of the transaction, we will assume approximately $24 million of WICOR debt.

The water industry is structurally attractive as a result of its large global market,
approximating $350 billion, and a growing demand for clean water. Our vision is to become the leading global provider of innovative products and systems used in the movement, treatment, storage, and enjoyment of water.

We expect to achieve $30 million in synergies with respect to the WICOR acquisition in the
first 18 months of operations via key initiatives including PIMS, material cost savings and administrative cost savings. We also expect to achieve significant working capital reductions, fixed asset reductions and capital expenditure savings as a
result of the acquisition.

We also announced that we have engaged Goldman
Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for our Tools segment, comprising the Porter-Cable, Delta, DeVilbiss Air Power Company, Oldham Saw and Flex businesses with $1,081.4 in net sales in 2003.

Outlook

In 2004, our operating objectives include the following:

Ÿ

Integrate the December 31, 2003 Everpure acquisition;

Ÿ

Complete and integrate the WICOR acquisition;

Ÿ

Complete the review of strategic alternatives for our Tools segment; and

Ÿ

Continue to drive our five strategic initiatives: cash flow, supply management, PIMS, talent management, and organic sales growth.

Financial Measures

In our Management’s Discussion and Analysis, we make reference to certain non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures, including gross
profit, operating income, selling, general and administrative (SG&A), income from continuing operations before income taxes, and provision for income taxes, in each case “excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges” or
“excluding restructuring charge.” We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they provide investors with



other measures to consider, in conjunction with the GAAP results, which may be helpful to meaningfully compare our operating performance between periods. We
also use these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing our own operating performance. A description of the accounting standards applicable to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill is included below under “New Accounting
Standards.” A description of the restructuring charges that we exclude from GAAP results is included below under “Results of Operations – Restructuring Charges.” In each case below when we make reference to a non-GAAP financial
measure, we also provide reconciliation to the comparable GAAP financial measure.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

Net sales

The components of the net sales change were:

Net sales in 2003 totaled $2,724
million, compared with $2,581 million in 2002, and $2,574 million in 2001. In 2003, volume increased by approximately 4.4 percent primarily due to increased demand in our Water segment and acquisitions in both our Water and Tools segments. Price
declined by approximately 1.0 percent driven by promotional programs for our Tools segment products. In addition, the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro in 2003 favorably impacted the dollar value of sales at our foreign
subsidiaries by about 2.2 percent.

In 2002, volume increased by 0.2 percent
primarily due to increased demand and acquisitions in both our Tools and Water segments. These increases were mostly offset by the continued weak demand for our Enclosures segment products. Price declined by 0.3 percent primarily due to the
introduction of lower price point products and promotional programs for our Tools segment products. In addition, the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar in 2002 favorably impacted the dollar value of sales by about 0.4 percent.

Sales by segment and the year-over-year changes were as follows:

Water

The 13.7 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

sales attributable to the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products;

Ÿ

higher sales of residential pumps and pool equipment;

Ÿ

an increase in European sales, particularly commercial valves, water conditioning and pool products;

Ÿ

continued growth in the developing markets of Asia and India; and

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects.



The 5.6 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

higher pump sales, with most of the growth coming from residential retail and municipal products;

Ÿ

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products; and

Ÿ

higher sales volume in our pool and spa equipment business.

Enclosures

The 4.8 percent increase in Enclosures segment
sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects; and

Ÿ

share growth in targeted areas such as networking, security, and medical.

The 19.4 percent decline in Enclosures segment sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

lower sales volume reflecting severely reduced capital spending in the industrial market; and

Ÿ

over-capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom markets.

These decreases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects.

Tools

The 1.0 percent decrease in Tools segment sales in
2003 from 2002 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

lower organic sales volume due to the effects of a slow economy and competitive marketplace; and

Ÿ

a decline in average selling prices due to increased promotional pricing.

These decreases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

sales attributable to the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Oldham Saw.

The 9.1 percent increase in Tools segment sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

higher sales volume in our DeVilbiss Air Power Company (DAPC) business, particularly for pressure washers;

Ÿ

higher sales volume in our Delta business as a result of our new sub-branding strategy through the creation of Delta Shopmaster

™

and Delta Industrial

™

brands. The Delta Shopmaster

™

brand is targeted toward the entry-level do-it-yourselfer and the Delta
Industrial

™

brand is targeted toward the
professional craftsman; and

Ÿ

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Oldham Saw.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

declines in average selling prices due to the introduction of lower price point products for the Delta Shopmaster

™

brand and heavy second-half 2002 promotional pricing in a more competitive
marketplace.

Gross profit

(1)

Includes $1 million of inventory charges related to the 2001 restructuring charge for our Enclosures segment.

The 1.0 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2003 from 2002
was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

savings generated from our supply management and lean enterprise initiatives;

Ÿ

improved productivity in our Enclosure and Water segments, particularly in our Pump business; and

Ÿ

lower costs as a result of general downsizing throughout Pentair.



These increases were offset by:

Ÿ

price declines, primarily in our Tools segment due to increased promotional pricing; and

Ÿ

volume declines in our Tools segment.

The 0.4 percentage point increase in gross profit as a percent of sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

savings generated from our supply management and lean enterprise initiatives, as well as cost savings realized from restructuring programs;

Ÿ

volume increases in our Tools and Water segments; and

Ÿ

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisitions of Oldham Saw and Plymouth Products.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

volume declines in our Enclosures segment; and

Ÿ

unfavorable selling prices due to increased promotional discounting in our Tools segment.

Selling, general and administrative (SG&A)

The 0.5 percentage point increase
in SG&A expense as a percent of sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

higher spending for promotional costs primarily in our Tools segment;

Ÿ

expenses related to downsizing throughout Pentair;

Ÿ

anticipated settlement and defense costs for a class action suit launched against the compressor industry for alleged mislabeling; and

Ÿ

strategic growth initiatives.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects; and

Ÿ

productivity improvements from lean enterprise initiatives in non-manufacturing areas.

The 0.1 percent point increase in SG&A expense as a percent of sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

higher bad debt expense offset by lower spending for process improvement investments.

Research and development (R&D)

The 0.2 percentage point increase
in R&D expense as a percent of sales in 2003 from 2002 and in 2002 from 2001 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

additional investments related to new product development initiatives in all three segments.



Restructuring charge

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we initiated a restructuring program designed to consolidate manufacturing operations and eliminate non-critical support facilities in our Enclosures segment. We also wrote off internal-use software
development costs at corporate for the abandonment of a company-wide human resource system. Consequently, we recorded a restructuring charge of $42.8 million, of which $1 million is included in

cost of goods sold

on the consolidated statement
of income for the write-down of inventory on certain custom enclosures product that were discontinued as a result of plant closures. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we also recorded a final change in estimate related to our 2000 restructuring charge
that reduced the restructuring charge by $1.7 million primarily due to favorable negotiation of contract termination costs. As of the end of 2001, the restructuring program initiated in 2000 was complete.

Included in

other current liabilities

on the consolidated balance sheets is the
remaining portion of the restructuring charge liability of $3.3 million, primarily related to severance obligations not yet paid to certain terminated individuals and other charges as we are awaiting the results of pending and threatened claims by
former employees of the affected facilities. Therefore, we are uncertain when this remaining liability will be paid. Payments in 2003 of $0.3 million are comprised of the payout of severance obligations and legal expenses. Funding of future payments
will be paid from cash generated from operating activities.

See ITEM 8, Note 4
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding restructuring charges.

Operating income

Water

The following table and discussion provides a comparison of our Water segment operating income as reported, and those results excluding goodwill
amortization.

The unchanged operating income
percentage in the Water segment as a percent of net sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

benefits from the continued success of our PIMS and supply management initiatives;

Ÿ

increased volume in our expanding markets of Europe, Asia, and India; and

Ÿ

favorable foreign currency effects.

These benefits were offset by:

Ÿ

increased selling and R&D expense;

Ÿ

higher insurance costs in 2003; and

Ÿ

price and volume declines related to our reverse osmosis product line and costs associated with downsizing the Chardon, Ohio operation and moving most of this product line to our
factory in India.

The 0.9 percentage point decline in Water
segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

unfavorable product mix as a result of higher sales of lower margin residential retail pumps;

Ÿ

higher costs at certain pump and water treatment businesses; and



Ÿ

price declines, primarily related to large international water treatment projects for reverse osmosis housings.

Enclosures

The following table and discussion provides a comparison of our Enclosures segment operating income as reported, and those results excluding goodwill amortization and restructuring charges.

The 3.4 percentage point increase
in Enclosures segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

efficiencies resulting from our continued implementation of PIMS and stronger sourcing practices;

Ÿ

volume-related efficiencies and improved product mix; and

Ÿ

shifting more production to lower-cost labor markets.

These increases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

expenses related to downsizing.

The 1.8 percentage point decline in Enclosures segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

lower sales volume due to continuing significant industry-wide sales declines, resulting in unabsorbed overhead despite reductions in overall cost structure.

The decline was partially offset by:

Ÿ

savings realized as part of our restructuring program, net of one-time nonrecurring costs.

Tools

The following table and
discussion provides a comparison of our Tools segment operating income as reported, and those results excluding goodwill amortization.

The 1.3 percentage point decrease
in Tools segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

a decline in average selling prices due to increased promotional pricing;

Ÿ

lower sales volumes;



Ÿ

higher ocean transportation costs and higher raw material prices;

Ÿ

anticipated settlement and defense costs for a class action suit launched against the compressor industry for alleged mislabeling; and

Ÿ

expenses related to capacity downsizing.

These decreases were partially offset by:

Ÿ

cost savings as a result of our supply management and PIMS initiatives;

Ÿ

lower distribution and outbound freight costs.

The 1.7 percentage point increase in Tools segment operating income as a percent of net sales in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due to:

Ÿ

higher sales volume, partially offset by price declines due to promotional discounting;

Ÿ

cost savings as a result of our supply management and PIMS initiatives; and

Ÿ

the fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Oldham Saw.

Net interest expense

The 0.2 percentage point decrease
in interest expense in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

lower interest rates partially offset by interest expense related to the financing of our 2003 acquisitions and a $1.6 million charge for accrued interest on the judgment in the
Horizon litigation discussion in Item 3.

The 0.7 percentage
point decrease in interest expense in 2002 from 2001 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

lower average borrowings driven by our strong cash flow performance in both 2002 and 2001, and lower interest rates on our variable rate debt.

Provision for income taxes

The following table and discussion provides a comparison of our provision for income taxes for continuing operations as reported, and those results excluding goodwill
amortization.

The 1.5 percentage point increase
in the tax rate in 2003 from 2002 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

the increase and mix of our 2003 domestic and foreign earnings coupled with our tax savings programs that are relatively fixed in nature.



The 1.7 percentage point increase in the tax rate in 2002 from 2001 was primarily the result of:

Ÿ

increased percentage of earnings taxed in countries with higher marginal rates.

Before any effects of our planned acquisition of WICOR, we expect our effective tax rate on continuing operations to be approximately 34
percent in 2004. Our ultimate effective tax rate will depend on the timing of the planned WICOR acquisition and WICOR’s actual tax attributes.

Discontinued operations/divestitures

In December 2000, we
adopted a plan to sell our Equipment segment businesses, Service Equipment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) and Lincoln Industrial, Inc. (Lincoln Industrial). In October 2001, we completed the sale of the Service Equipment businesses to
Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of $18.2 million. In December 2001, we completed the sale of Lincoln Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan), other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial for
total consideration of $78.4 million, including a preferred stock interest. The selling price of Lincoln Industrial was subject to a final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in January 2003, in which we paid Jordan $2.4 million. In the
fourth quarter of 2003, we reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, primarily due to a reduction in estimated proceeds related to exiting two remaining facilities.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, equity investments,
acquisitions, debt repayments, and dividend payments are generally funded from cash generated from operations, availability under existing committed revolving credit facilities, and in certain instances, equity and debt transactions.

The following table presents selected working capital measurements calculated from our
monthly operating results based on a 13-month moving average and indicates our emphasis on working capital management:

Operating activities

Operating activities provided cash flow of $262.9 million in 2003, compared with $270.8 million in 2002 and $232.3 million in 2001. The $7.9
million decrease in 2003 from 2002 was primarily due to smaller benefits from working capital improvements offset by an increase in net income. The $38.5 million increase in 2002 from 2001 was primarily due an increase in net income and better
working capital management.

Investing activities

Capital expenditures in 2003, 2002, and 2001 were $43.6 million or 1.6 percent of sales, $56.7 million (including $23.0 million for the acquisition of a previously leased
facility) or 2.2 percent of sales, and $53.7 million or 2.1 percent of sales, respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures in 2004 to be approximately $50.0 million primarily in the areas of new product development and general maintenance
capital.

On December 31, 2003, we acquired all of the common stock of
Everpure, Inc. (Everpure), from United States Filter Corporation, a unit of Veolia Environnement, for $217.3 million in cash, including cash acquired of $5.5 million.

During 2003, we also completed four product line acquisitions in our Water segment for total consideration of $21.4 million in cash:
Hydrotemp Manufacturing Co., Inc., Letro Products, Inc. and certain assets of TwinPumps, Inc. and K&M Plastics, Inc.



In the first quarter of 2003, we received $1.9 million in purchase price adjustments relative to our fourth quarter 2002
acquisition of Plymouth Products. The adjustments primarily related to final determination of closing date net assets.

In January 2003, we paid $2.4 million for a final adjustment to the selling price related to the disposition of Lincoln Industrial. This had no effect on earnings for the
twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as the amount was offset by previously established reserves.

In the fourth quarter of 2002, we acquired Plymouth Products and Oldham Saw for $174.7 million total consideration, including debt assumed of $2.7 million and cash acquired of $1.7 million.

We have invested approximately $30.5 million to acquire a 49 percent interest in the joint
venture operations of a long time Asian supplier for bench top power tools, of which $5.6 million was paid in 2003, $4.5 million was paid in 2002 and $20.4 million was paid in 2001. In February 2004, we signed a letter of intent to purchase the
remaining 51 percent ownership interest in this supplier.

We periodically
review our array of businesses in comparison to our overall strategic and performance objectives. As part of this review, we may routinely acquire or divest certain businesses.

Financing activities

Net cash
provided by financing activities approximated $33.8 million in 2003 compared with net cash used by financing activities of $38.6 million in 2002 and $222.9 million in 2001. Financing activities in 2003 were comprised of a $200 million private
placement of senior notes with 10-year maturities and a new committed $500 million revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which matures in three years. The $500 million Credit Facility replaced two existing revolving credit
facilities totaling $652 million of credit availability. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings. The $200 million private placement included $100 million of variable rate senior notes with an interest rate
equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.15 percent and $100 million of fixed rate senior notes with an average interest rate of 4.98 percent. We used the $200 million proceeds received in the second half of 2003 from the private placement to pay
down debt under the Credit Facility.

Financing activities included draw downs
and repayments on the revolver to fund our operations in the normal course of business. We used the revolver to fund our acquisitions of Everpure for $217.3 million in 2003 and Plymouth Products and Oldham Saw for $174.7 million in 2002.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to the extent availability
exists under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is used as back-up liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2003, we have $64.8 million of commercial paper outstanding that matures within 30 days. All of
the commercial paper is classified as long-term as we intend and have the ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis.

Credit available under our Credit Facility, as limited by our most restrictive financial covenant, was approximately $228 million and is based on a ratio of total debt to
EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). In addition, our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount we may pay for dividends and require us to maintain certain financial ratios and
a minimum net worth. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2003.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $55 million of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had $10 million outstanding as of December 31, 2003.



At December 31, 2003, our capital structure consisted of $806.5 million in total indebtedness and $1,261.5 million
in shareholders’ equity. The ratio of debt-to-capital was 39.0 percent, compared with 39.9 percent at December 31, 2002. Our targeted debt-to-total capital ratio range is approximately 40 percent. We will exceed this target from time to
time as needed for operational purposes and/or acquisitions.

The following
summarizes our significant contractual obligations that impact our liquidity:

A purchase obligation is defined as an
agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us that specifies all significant terms. The purchase obligation amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases, but represent those purchases for
which we are contractually obligated. As of December 31, 2003, we did not have any purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of $1 million or greater per year.

Dividends paid in 2003 were $40.5 million, compared with $36.4 million in 2002, and $34.3 million in 2001. The year-over-year increases
reflect an increase in our annual per-share dividend of $0.82 in 2003, compared with $0.74 in 2002, and $0.70 in 2001. We have paid dividends for the past 28 years and anticipate paying future dividends.

On February 4, 2004, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire WICOR Inc.
(“WICOR”), a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corporation, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. We expect to fund the WICOR acquisition through our currently available and newly committed lines of credit. We have obtained a commitment, subject to customary
conditions, in the aggregate amount of $850 million (the “Bridge Facility”), for the payment of the purchase price. The Bridge Facility is available for a period up to the earlier of (i) September 1, 2004, (ii) the closing of the
acquisition without the use of the Bridge Facility or (iii) the sale of the Pentair Tools Group.

The term loan to be made under the Bridge Facility (the “Loan”), pursuant to a formal loan agreement to be negotiated, is contemplated to be available in a single disbursement upon closing of the WICOR
acquisition and is for the purpose of payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses. The closing of the Loan must occur before September 1, 2004. Any balance due under the Loan is repayable in full, with accrued interest, no later than
December 31, 2004. We will need to fund the repayment of the Bridge Facility by December 31, 2004 through a disposition of our Tools Group or through equity issuance.

As a result of our announcement of an agreement to acquire WICOR, see Note 18, Moody’s Investor Services has confirmed our long-term
bank rating of Baa3 and changed the outlook to negative from stable. At the same time, Standard and Poor’s Rating Services has placed our BBB corporate credit and other ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The change in rating
outlook to negative from stable reflects the increased financial and integration risks associated with the planned acquisition of WICOR. In addition, the timing and nature of any outcome resulting from the exploration of strategic alternatives for
the Tools segment remains uncertain and



subject to execution risk. In a related action, Moody’s Investor Services placed the Baa3 senior unsecured rating on our $250 million notes and the Baa3
rating on senior notes under our $225 million shelf registration under review for possible downgrade, due to the structural subordination thereof. Existing lenders under our Credit Facility and private placement notes benefit from guarantees from
our domestic subsidiaries, while the $250 million senior note holders do not benefit from such guarantees. We are putting in place a similar guarantee for the benefit of the $250 million senior note holders to avoid the downgrade due to the
structural subordination.

We are seeking to obtain an amendment to the Credit
Facility to allow an increase to the ratio of total debt to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) for the period of the Bridge Facility, which we believe will be granted by the banks participating in our Credit
Facility. In addition, during the period the Bridge Facility is outstanding, additional limitations will be placed on share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and sales of assets.

In 2004, interest expense will be primarily driven by the timing of the closing of the WICOR acquisition and any strategic alternative we
pursue for our Tools segment.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements
to support working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order to meet these cash requirements, we intend to use available cash and internally generated funds and to borrow
under our committed and uncommitted credit facilities.

Long-term debt and
lines of credit are explained in detail in ITEM 8, Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Operating leases are explained in detail in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Other financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based upon operating, investing, and financing classifications included in the consolidated statements of cash
flows, we also measure our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use to assess our cash flow performance and have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent conversion
of net income. We believe our ability to convert net income into free cash flow gives us opportunities to invest in new growth initiatives to create shareholder value. We believe free cash flow is an important measure of operating performance
because it provides us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available to fund acquisitions and repay debt. In addition, free cash flow is used as criteria to measure and pay compensation-based incentives. The
following table is a reconciliation of free cash flow with cash flows from operating activities:

Before any effects of our planned
acquisition of WICOR, we expect 2004 free cash flow to exceed $200 million.

Off-balance sheet arrangements

At December 31, 2003, we had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental cleanups, in which our current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis



status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results
of operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company
ammunition business in 1997, and the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the
paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities. We have recently settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was
adequate.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues concerning a
limited number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999 that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at
this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When it has been possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites,
provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, our reserve for such environmental liabilities was approximately $11.2 million, measured on an undiscounted basis.
We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Stand-by letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly in our pumps business, we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any
non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of credit to secure our performance to third parties under
self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled $35.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be
adopted in the future.



CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Item 8, Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by
management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, terms of existing
contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if:

Ÿ

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

Ÿ

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected would have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment of Goodwill

The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market comparable, and market
capitalization approaches. The test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about projected future cash flows and appropriate discount rates. If these estimates change, we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill. During the fourth
quarter of 2003, we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

Impairment of Long-lived Assets Including Cost and Equity Method Investments

We review the recoverability of
long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The assessment of possible impairment is
based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the carrying value of
such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are reduced for the
cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

At the end of 2003, we have $57.4 million invested in certain privately held companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. We write down or write off an
investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the investees’ financial condition, and in
certain cases the possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the investees’ historical results of operations, and projected results and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from
projections, we may incur future charges for the impairment of these investments.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates,
rate of increase in future compensation levels, and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Item 8, Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these assumptions will affect pension
expense.



Discount rate

The
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of year based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to
payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions. As a relatively young company, with a longer duration of liabilities than older companies with more mature workforces,
this produced a discount rate of 6.25 percent. There are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2004. A 25 basis point decrease (increase) in our discount rate, holding constant our
expected long-term return on plan assets and other assumptions, would increase (decrease) pension expense by approximately $1.4 million per year. We elected to utilize a 25 basis point hypothetical change as the assumption difference to demonstrate
the sensitivity of our pension expense to a change in the discount rate.

Expected rate of return

The expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be subject to
considerable year-to-year variance from actual returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we considered our historical ten year compounded return of 9.5 percent, with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader longer term market indices. In 2003, the pension plan assets yielded a positive return of 24.8 percent, compared to negative returns of 10.5 percent and 4.1 percent in 2002 and 2001,
respectively. Our expected rate of return in 2003 equaled 8.5 percent, which remained unchanged from 2002 and 2001. In 2003, the significant difference between our expected return on plan assets of $24.7 million compared to our actual return on plan
assets of $55.5 million was primarily due to the economic recovery and the resurgence of the financial markets. There are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2004. A one percent decrease
(increase) in the expected return on plan assets assumption, holding constant our discount rate and other assumptions, would increase (decrease) pension expense by approximately $3.1 million per year. We elected to use a one percent hypothetical
change as the assumption difference facilitates extrapolation of changes in the expected rate of return assumption.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation
recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the
actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year-period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension-related adjustments to equity

In 2002, our discount rate was lowered from 7.25 percent to 6.25 percent and we realized a negative 10.5 percent return on plan assets which caused the accumulated
benefit obligation to exceed the fair market value of plan assets as of December 31, 2002. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid asset, was the primary cause of a $29.2 million net-of-tax charge to
shareholders’ equity for 2002. The recovery of the financial markets in 2003 and positive return on plan assets of 24.8 percent eliminated $20.9 million of the charge to shareholders’ equity. The charge did not impact earnings.

Net periodic benefit cost

Total net periodic pension benefits cost was $15.7 million in 2003, $12.6 million in 2002, and $10.6 million in 2001. Total net periodic pension benefits cost is expected
to be approximately $17.0 million in 2004. The increasing trend in net periodic pension cost from 2001 forward is largely driven by the downturn in the financial markets in 2002 and 2001 and the decrease in the discount rate in 2002. The net
periodic pension benefit cost for 2004 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of 6.25 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.



Unrecognized pension losses

As of December 31, 2003 measurement date, our pension plans have $75.7 million of cumulative unrecognized losses of which approximately $20 million relates to the use of the market related value method and is not immediately subject to
amortization. The remaining unrecognized loss, to the extent it exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, will be amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active
participants (currently approximately 12 years). The amount included in pension expense for loss amortization in 2003 was $0.5 million.

Contributions

Pension contributions in 2003 total $19.1 million, including $15.1
million of contributions to domestic defined benefit pension plans. In 2002, pension contributions totaled $18.9 million, including $15.3 million of contributions to domestic defined benefit plans. The contributions in 2003 and 2002 exceeded the
minimum funding requirement. Our 2004 pension contributions are expected to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million.

Asset allocation

Our actual overall asset allocation for the plans as
compared to our investment policy goals is as follows:

(1)

Actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2003.

We regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Our cash balance is higher
than normal due to a $15.1 million contribution made to our domestic defined benefit plans as of December 31, 2003. From time to time, we may be outside our targeted ranges by amounts we deem acceptable.

Equity securities include Pentair common stock in the amount of $21.6 million (8 percent of
total plan assets) and $16.3 million (7 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

See ITEM 8, Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding pension plans.



ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk

Market risk is the potential economic loss that
may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We are exposed to various market risks, including changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative financial instruments to manage and reduce the
impact of some of these risks. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes.

Interest rate risk

We are exposed to changes in interest rates
primarily as a result of our borrowing activities used to fund operations. Interest rate swaps are used to manage a portion of our interest rate risk. The table below presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity for
variable rate and fixed rate debt obligations. Variable interest rates disclosed represent the weighted-average rate of the portfolio at each period end. Notional amounts and related interest rate of interest rate swaps are presented by year of
maturity. For the swaps, variable rates are the average forward rates for the term of each contract.

Foreign currency risk

We are exposed to foreign exchange risk as a result of transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries,
including subsidiary debt. We have entered into foreign currency forward exchange agreements with a major financial institution to hedge firm foreign currency commitments. In 2003, the following forward exchange agreements matured: receive $50.0
million U.S. dollars, pay $69.4 million Canadian dollars, receive $69.4 million Canadian dollars, and pay $45.3 million Euros. As of December 31, 2003, the following table presents principal cash flows and fair values of our open currency forward
exchange agreements:

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT

Board of Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated statements of income, cash flows, and changes in shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule
listed in the Index at Item 15. These financial statements and the financial statement schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements and the financial
statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit
includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries at December 31,
2003 and 2002, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our
opinion, such financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective January 1, 2002,

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on
December 31. Additionally, we report our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and non-U.S., that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own 20 percent to 50 percent of the voting stock and have the
ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and, as a result, our share of the earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in
the statement of income. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in which Pentair has less than a 20 percent ownership interest and we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence. These investments are carried at cost and
are adjusted only for other-than-temporary declines in fair value.

Certain
reclassifications have been made to the prior years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year’s presentation.

Use of estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting policies that require our most significant
estimates and judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including goodwill, and cost and equity method investments; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery
has occurred (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold other than warranty obligations in the normal, ordinary course of business. In the event significant
post-shipment obligations were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Sales returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly
with our customers. Revenue from a transaction is recognized only if our price is fixed and determinable at the date of sale; the customer has paid or is obligated to pay; the customer’s obligation would not be changed in the event of theft or
physical destruction or damage of the product, the customer has economic substance apart from our Company; we do not have significant obligations for future performance to directly bring about resale of the product by the customer; and the amount of
returns can reasonably be estimated.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

In general, our return policy allows for customer returns only upon our authorization. Goods returned must be product
we continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of custom or modified goods are normally not allowed.

At the time of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect of returns. Estimated sales returns include consideration of historical sales levels, the timing and
magnitude of historical sales return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type of customer, and a projection of this experience into the future.

Pricing and sales incentives

We record estimated reductions to
revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements, promotions, and other volume-based incentives at the later of the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered. Sales incentives given to our customers
is recorded as a reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable benefit for the goods or services in exchange for the consideration and (2) we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received. The following represents a
description of our pricing arrangements, promotions, and other volume-based incentives:

Pricing arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers and we record sales at the
agreed upon net selling price. However, one of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a percentage of the original purchase price if they can demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM customer. At the time of sale, we estimate the
anticipated refund to be paid based on historical experience and reduce sales for the probable cost of the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as cooperative advertising. Under this cooperative advertising program, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of sales as an allowance to be used to advertise and promote our
products. The customer is not required to provide evidence of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the cost of this cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The cost of this program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer achieves a specified cumulative
level of sales. Under these incentive programs, at the time of sale, we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least monthly, for each customer and sales are reduced for the
anticipated cost of the rebate. If the forecasted sales for a customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

There has been no material accounting revisions for revenue-recognition related estimates.

Shipping and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling is recorded in

net sales

in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Shipping and handling costs
incurred by Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

cost of goods sold

in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.

Cash equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts, reducing our receivables balance to
an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

We perform periodic credit evaluations of our customer’s financial condition and generally do not require
collateral. In addition, we encounter a certain amount of credit risk as a result of a concentration of receivables among a few significant customers. Approximately 23 percent and 25 percent of our receivables were due from three large home
improvement retailers as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories of United States subsidiaries
are generally determined by the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method. Inventories of foreign-based subsidiaries are determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) and moving average methods.

Property, plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at historical cost. We compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements that add to
productive capacity or extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed
from the accounts and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We
review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash
flows are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar manner,
except that fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Goodwill and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over of the fair value of identifiable tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets

. Under the provisions of this statement, effective January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortized but tested for impairment on an annual basis. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we completed our annual
impairment test of goodwill and determined no impairment charge was necessary. The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated by an independent third party using a combination of the discounted cash flow, market comparable, and market
capitalization approaches.

The primary identifiable intangible assets of
Pentair include trademarks and trade names acquired in business combinations, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technology and customer relationships. Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, identifiable intangibles with finite lives are
amortized and those identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets
not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if events warrant. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount. During the fourth quarter of 2003,
we completed our annual impairment test for those identifiable assets not subject to amortization and determined there was no impairment charge.

The following table illustrates the pro forma impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 142 on our income from continuing operations as well as basic and diluted earnings per
share:

Our accounting policy prior to the
adoption of SFAS No. 142 was to amortize goodwill on a straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be benefited, principally between 25 and 40 years.

Cost and equity method investments

We have investments that are accounted for at historical cost or, if we have significant influence over the investee, using the equity method. Pentair’s proportionate share of income or losses from investments accounted for under the
equity method is recorded in the consolidated statements of income. We write down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment that is other-than-temporary. This requires
significant judgment, including assessment of the investees’ financial condition, and in certain cases the possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the investees’ historical results of operations, and projected results and
cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are significantly different from projections, we may incur future charges for the impairment of these investments.

Income taxes

Pentair uses the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets
and liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the
period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation
allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Environmental

We recognize environmental cleanup liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each
environmental cleanup is estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the likelihood that, where applicable,
other potentially responsible parties (PRPs) will be able to fulfill their commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and severally liable. For closed or closing plants owned by Pentair and properties being sold, an estimated liability is
typically recognized at the time the closure decision is made or sale is recorded and is based on an environmental assessment of the plant property. The process of estimating environmental cleanup liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on
the nature and extent of historical information and physical data relating to a contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies
and other PRPs at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or regulations, advances in cleanup technologies, and additional information about the ultimate cleanup remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.

Insurance subsidiary

We insure general and product liability, property, workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary.
Reserves for policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. As of the end of 2003 and 2002, reserves for policy claims were $32.4 million ($10.0 million included in

accrued product claims and warranties

and
$22.4 million included in

other noncurrent liabilities

) and $27.0 million ($10.0 million included in

accrued product claims and warranties

and $17.0 million included in

other noncurrent liabilities

).

Stock-based compensation

Pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based

Compensation,

we apply the recognition and measurement
principles of Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25,

Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,

to our stock options and other stock-based compensation plans.

In accordance with APB Opinion No. 25, cost for stock based compensation is recognized in income based on the excess, if any, of the quoted
market price of the stock at the grant date of the award or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock. The exercise price for stock options granted to employees equals the fair market value of Pentair’s
common stock at the date of grant, thereby resulting in no recognition of compensation expense by Pentair. Restricted stock awards are recorded as compensation cost over the requisite vesting periods based on the market value on the date of grant.
Unearned compensation cost on restricted stock awards is shown as a reduction to shareholders’ equity.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The following table illustrates the effect on income from continuing operations and earnings per share if we had
applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123 to stock-based employee compensation. The estimated fair value of each Pentair option is calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.

The weighted-average fair value of
options granted in 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $11.49, $10.37, and $7.17 per option, respectively. We estimated the fair values using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, modified for dividends and using the following assumptions:

Earnings per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per
share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including the dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock. Unless otherwise noted, references are to diluted earnings per share.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Basic and diluted earnings per share were calculated using the following:

Derivative financial instruments

Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, as
amended. These standards require us to recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our balance sheet. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value hedge, the changes in
the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI) and
are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the hedged item affects earnings. SFAS No. 133 defines new requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships as well as ongoing effectiveness assessments in order to
use hedge accounting. For a derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are reported in earnings immediately.

Foreign

currency translation

The financial statements of
subsidiaries located outside of the United States are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date. The resultant
translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of exchange.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Cumulative effect of accounting change

The adoption of SFAS No. 133 on January 1, 2001, resulted in an increase to other assets and other noncurrent liabilities of $7.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and a cumulative transition adjustment of $6.7
million in OCI. The transition adjustment relates to our hedging activities through December 31, 2000. Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 133, financial instruments designated as hedges were not recorded in the financial statements, but cash flows
from such contracts were recorded as adjustments to earnings as the hedged items affected earnings.

We use derivative financial instruments for the purpose of hedging interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of ongoing business operations. All hedging instruments are designated and effective as
hedges, in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, as amended. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All other contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative
also meet the requirements of, and have been designated as, normal purchases or sales. Our policy is to not enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or sales.

Other newly adopted accounting standards

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143,

Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations

. This new standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for
obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. It applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction,
development, and/or the normal operation of a long-lived asset, except for certain obligations of lessees. SFAS No. 143 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The adoption of this standard on
January 1, 2003 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146,

Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

This new standard nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3,

Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination

Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring).

SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit
activity that does not involve an entity newly acquired in a business combination or with a disposal activity covered by SFAS No. 144, be recognized when the liability is incurred, rather than the date of an entity’s commitment to an exit plan.
SFAS No. 146 is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, with earlier application encouraged. The adoption of this standard on January 1, 2003 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
position or results of operations.

In November 2002, the FASB issued
Interpretation No. 45,

Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others

. Interpretation No. 45 elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most
guarantees, including loan guarantees. It also clarifies that at the time an entity issues a guarantee, the issuing entity must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee. However, the
provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor’s obligations does not apply to product warranties, guarantees accounted for as derivatives, or other guarantees of an entity’s
own future performance. We have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of December 31, 2002. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. The adoption of the initial recognition and measurement provisions were not material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations.

In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132,

Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Post-retirement Benefits

. The
revised standard requires new disclosures in addition to those required by the original standard about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

and other defined benefit post-retirement plans. As revised, SFAS No. 132 is effective for financial statements with fiscal years ending after December 15,
2003. The interim-period disclosures required by this standard are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2003. However, disclosure of the estimated future benefit payments is effective for fiscal years ending after June 15,
2004. See Item 8, Note 12 for disclosures regarding our defined benefit pension plans and other post-retirement benefits.

New accounting standards to be adopted in the future

In
January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46,

Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIE), an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,

which requires all VIEs to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the
entity that holds the majority of the beneficial interests in the VIE.

In
December 2003, the FASB revised FIN 46, delaying the effective dates for certain entities created before February 1, 2003, and making other amendments to clarify application of the guidance. For potential variable interest entities other than any
Special Purpose Entities (SPEs), the revised FIN 46 (FIN 46R) is now required to be applied no later than the end of the first fiscal year or interim reporting period ending after March 15, 2004. The original guidance under FIN 46 is still
applicable, however, for all SPEs created prior to February 1, 2003 at the end of the first interim or annual reporting period ending after December 15, 2003. FIN 46 may be applied prospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date it
is first applied, or by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. FIN 46R also requires certain disclosures of an entity’s relationship with variable
interest entities. We will adopt FIN 46R for non-SPE entities in our first quarter ending April 3, 2004. We have not yet determined the effect of adopting the provisions of FIN 46R. However, we do not believe it will have a material effect on our
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

On January 12, 2004,
the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 106-1,

Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003.

The FSP permits a sponsor of a post-retirement health care plan
that provides a prescription drug benefit to make a one-time election to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. We do not believe the FSP will have a material effect on our
financial statements because we do not expect to receive significant subsidies under the Act.

2.    Acquisitions

On December 31, 2003, we acquired all of the common stock of Everpure, Inc. (Everpure), from United States Filter Corporation, a unit of Veolia Environnement, for $217.3 million in cash, including cash acquired of $5.5 million. We believe
Everpure will enhance our future growth in the commercial filtration segment. It is anticipated Everpure’s strong trade name, industry leading technology, rapid product development capabilities, and broad footprint in North America, Europe, and
Asia, will leverage the strengths of our Water segment and accelerate the long-term growth and profitability of Pentair.

The initial allocation of purchase price for the Everpure acquisition was based on preliminary estimates and may be revised as better information becomes available in
2004. The closing date balance sheet is expected to be delivered by March 31, 2004.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The initial purchase price of Everpure has been allocated based on management’s estimates and independent
appraisals as follows:

A preliminary valuation of the
acquired intangible assets was performed by a third party valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of each identifiable intangible. Standard valuation procedures were utilized in determining the fair value of the acquired
intangibles. The following table summarizes the identified intangible asset categories and their weighted average amortization period:

*

Approximately $104 million of goodwill is tax deductible.

During 2003, we also completed four product line acquisitions in our Water segment for total consideration of approximately $21.4 million in cash.

Ÿ

HydroTemp Manufacturing Co., Inc. (HydroTemp) designs and manufactures heat pumps for swimming pool applications.

Ÿ

Letro Products, Inc. (Letro Products) designs and manufactures swimming pool accessories including cleaners.

Ÿ

Certain assets of TwinPumps, Inc. (TwinPumps) are used in the design and manufacture of vortex and chopper pumps for municipal wastewater applications.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Ÿ

Certain assets of K&M Plastics, Inc., (K&M Plastics) are used in the design and manufacture of blow-molded brine tanks and pressure vessels for residential and commercial
water conditioning and filtration applications.

We acquired
HydroTemp and Letro Products in March 2003 to complement our existing pool and spa equipment business of our Water segment. We acquired certain assets of TwinPumps in July 2003. We will combine the assets of TwinPumps with our existing pump business
of our Water segment to pursue replacement parts, replacement pumps, and new projects in the municipal wastewater business. We acquired certain assets of K&M Plastics, in July 2003, with the intent of establishing pressure vessel manufacturing
capacity in China to better serve the fast growing Asian water market. The aggregated annual revenue of the acquired businesses is approximately $22.0 million.

The allocation of the purchase price of these four product line acquisitions resulted in goodwill of $17.3 million, all of which is tax deductible. We continue to
evaluate the initial purchase accounting allocations for these acquisitions and will adjust the allocations as additional information relative to the fair market values of the assets and liabilities of the businesses become known.

In the first quarter of 2003, we received $1.9 million in purchase price adjustments relative
to our fourth quarter 2002 acquisition of Plymouth Products, Inc. (Plymouth Products) which was credited to reduce goodwill initially recorded at closing. The adjustments primarily related to final determination of closing date net assets.

On September 30, 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of Plymouth
Products and affiliated entities from USF Consumer & Commercial WaterGroup, a unit of Vivendi Environnement (now Veolia Environnement), for total consideration of $121.7 million, including debt assumed of $1.2 million. Plymouth Products is a
manufacturer of water filtration products used in residential, commercial, and industrial applications. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $8.0 million. Goodwill recorded as part of the initial purchase price
allocation was $79.7 million as of December 31, 2003. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2003.

On October 1, 2002, we acquired all of the common stock of privately-held Oldham Saw Co., Inc. and affiliated entities (Oldham Saw) for total consideration of $53.0
million cash, including debt assumed of $1.5 million and cash acquired of $1.7 million. Oldham Saw designs, manufactures, and markets router bits, circular saw blades, and related accessories for the do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional power tool
markets. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were $9.6 million. Goodwill recorded as part of the initial purchase price allocation was $29.9 million. Pursuant to an earn-out provision, the purchase price could increase
depending on Oldham Saw achieving certain net sales and EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) targets in 2003 and 2004. In 2003, there were no contingent payments made. In 2004, the maximum total contingent
payments based on these targets could be $1 million.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The following pro forma consolidated condensed financial results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2003,
and 2002 are presented as if the acquisitions had been acquired at the beginning of each period presented.

These pro forma consolidated condensed
financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments, such as increased interest expense on acquisition debt. They do not reflect the effect of synergies that would have been expected to result from the
integration of these acquisitions. The pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the combination occurred on January 1 of each year presented, or of future results of
the consolidated entities.

3.    Discontinued
Operations/Divestitures

In December 2000, we adopted a plan to sell our
Equipment segment businesses, Service Equipment (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) and Lincoln Industrial, Inc. (Lincoln Industrial). In October 2001, we completed the sale of the Service Equipment businesses to Clore Automotive, LLC for
total consideration of $18.2 million. In December 2001, we completed the sale of Lincoln Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan), other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial for total consideration of $78.4
million, including a preferred stock interest. The selling price of Lincoln Industrial was subject to a final purchase price adjustment that was finalized in January 2003, in which we paid Jordan $2.4 million which was charged to a previously
established reserve.

Our financial statements have been restated to reflect
the Equipment segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Operating results of the discontinued Equipment segment are summarized below. The amounts exclude general corporate overhead previously allocated to the Equipment segment.
The amounts include an allocation of interest based on a ratio of the net assets of the discontinued operations to the total net assets of Pentair.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

In the fourth quarter of 2003, we reported an additional loss from discontinued operations of $2.9 million primarily
due to a reduction in estimated proceeds related to exiting two remaining facilities. One facility is owned and the other facility is under an operating lease.

The net liabilities or assets of
discontinued operations are included in the respective categories of other current assets, other current liabilities and other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for 2003 and 2002.

At December 31, 2003, accruals totaling $4.1 million represent the estimated future cash
outflows associated with the exit from the leased facility. The owned facility is recorded at its estimated net realizable value.

4.    Restructuring Charge

In the fourth quarter of 2001, we initiated a restructuring program designed to consolidate manufacturing operations and eliminate non-critical support facilities in our
Enclosures segment. We also wrote off internal-use software development costs at corporate for the abandonment of a company-wide human resource system. Consequently, we recorded a restructuring charge of $42.8 million, of which $1 million is
included in

cost of goods sold

on the consolidated statement of income for the write-down of inventory on certain custom enclosures product that were discontinued as a result of plant closures. In the fourth quarter of 2001, we also recorded
a final change in estimate related to our 2000 restructuring charge that reduced the restructuring charge by $1.7 million primarily due to favorable negotiation of contract termination costs. As of the end of 2001, the restructuring program
initiated in 2000 was complete.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The major components of the 2001 restructuring charges and remaining restructuring liability follows:

Included in

other current
liabilities

on the consolidated balance sheets is the remaining portion of the restructuring charge liability of $3.3 million, primarily related to severance obligations not yet paid to certain terminated individuals and other charges as we are
awaiting the results of pending and threatened claims by former employees of the affected facilities. Therefore, we are uncertain when this remaining liability will be paid. Payments in 2003 are comprised of the payout of severance obligations and
legal expenses. Funding of future payments will be paid from cash generated from operating activities.

Workforce reductions related to the 2001 restructuring charge are for approximately 870 employees, terminated primarily in 2001 and 2002. Employee termination benefits consist primarily of severance and outplacement
counseling fees. Employee termination benefits for the 2001 restructuring charge includes a $0.4 million non-cash charge for the intrinsic value of stock options modified as part of a severance agreement.

Non-cash asset disposals for the 2001 restructuring charges were for the write-down of
equipment, leasehold improvements, and inventory as a direct result of our decisions to exit certain facilities and the abandonment of internal use software under development. Exit costs are primarily related to contract and lease termination costs.

The following table summarizes the components of the 2001 restructuring
charges by segment, net of changes in estimates:

Certain inventories are valued at
LIFO. If all inventories were valued at FIFO as of the end of 2003 and 2002, inventories would have been $287.2 million and $296.7 million, respectively.

Equity method investments

We have invested approximately $30.5
million to acquire a 49 percent interest in the joint venture operations of a long time Asian supplier for bench top power tools, of which $5.6 million was paid in 2003, $4.5 million was paid in 2002 and $20.4 million was paid in 2001. In February
2004, we signed a letter of intent to purchase the remaining 51 percent ownership interest in this supplier. Our portion of the losses for these joint ventures is included in

cost of goods sold

; however, it is not material.

Cost method investments

As part of the sale of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we received 37,500 shares of 5% Series C Junior Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock convertible into a 15 percent
equity interest in the new organization—LN Holdings Corporation. The preferred stock is recorded at $18.4 million, which represents the estimated fair value of that investment at the time of sale.

In July 2002, we invested an additional $5.0 million for a total investment of $10.0 million
in the preferred stock of a privately held developer and manufacturer of laser leveling and measuring devices.

7.    Supplemental Cash Flow Information

The following table summarizes supplemental cash flow information:

Supplemental disclosure of non-cash investing and financing activities

As part of the sale of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we received 37,500 shares of 5% Series C Junior Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock convertible into a 15 percent
equity interest in the new organization – LN Holdings Corporation. The preferred stock is recorded at $18.4 million, which represents the estimated fair value of that investment at the time of sale.

8.    Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consist of the following:

In 2003, the minimum pension liability
adjustment decreased by $20.9 million largely due to improved pension asset performance. In 2002, the decrease in the discount rate and poor pension plan asset performance caused the $29.2 million increase in the minimum pension liability
adjustment. The net foreign currency translation gain in 2003 and 2002 of $27.2 million and $25.2 million, respectively, was primarily the result of the continued weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and Canadian dollar currencies. Changes
in the market value of derivative financial instruments was impacted primarily by the maturities of derivatives and changing interest rates. Fluctuations in the value of hedging instruments are generally offset by changes in the cash flows of the
underlying exposures being hedged.

9.    Debt

Long-term debt and the average interest rate on debt outstanding as of
December 31 is summarized as follows:

On July 25, 2003, we completed new
financing arrangements totaling $700 million, comprised of a $200 million private placement of senior notes with 10-year maturities (of which $150 million was funded during the third quarter and $50 million was funded during the fourth quarter of
2003) and a new committed $500 million



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) which matures in three years. The $500 million Credit Facility replaced two existing revolving
credit facilities totaling $652 million of credit availability. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings. The $200 million private placement included $100 million of variable rate senior notes with an interest
rate equal to the three-month LIBOR rate plus 1.15 percent and $100 million of fixed rate senior notes with an average interest rate of 4.98 percent. We used the $200 million proceeds received in the second half of 2003 from the private placement to
pay down debt under the Credit Facility.

We are authorized to sell short-term
commercial paper notes to the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. The Credit Facility is used as back-up liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2003, we have $64.8 million of commercial paper
outstanding that matures within 30 days. All of the commercial paper is classified as long-term as we intend and have the ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis.

Credit available under our Credit Facility, as limited by our most restrictive financial covenant, was approximately $228 million and is
based on a ratio of total debt to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). In addition, our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants that restrict the amount we may pay for dividends and require us to
maintain certain financial ratios and a minimum net worth. We were in compliance with all covenants as of December 31, 2003.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $55 million of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had $10 million outstanding as of December 31, 2003.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

As a result of our announcement of an
agreement to acquire WICOR (see Note 18), Moody’s Investor Services has confirmed the our long-term bank rating of Baa3 and changed our outlook to negative from stable. At the same time, Standard and Poor’s Rating Services has place our
BBB corporate credit and other ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications. The change in rating outlook to negative from stable reflects the increased financial and integration risks associated with the planned acquisition of WICOR. In
addition, the timing and nature of any outcome resulting from the exploration of strategic alternatives for the Tools segment remains uncertain and subject to execution risk. In a related action, Moody’s Investor Services placed the Baa3 senior
unsecured rating on our $250 million notes and the Baa3 rating on our senior notes under our $225 million shelf registration under review for possible downgrade, due to structural subordination thereof. Existing lenders under our Credit Facility and
private placement notes benefit from guarantees from our domestic subsidiaries, while the $250 million senior note holders do not benefit from such guarantees. We are pursuing putting in place a similar guarantee for the benefit of the $250 million
senior note holders to avoid the downgrade due to the structural subordination.

We expect to fund the WICOR acquisition through our currently available and newly committed lines of credit. We have obtained a commitment, subject to customary conditions, in the aggregate amount of $850 million (the “Bridge
Facility”) for the payment of the purchase price. The Bridge Facility is available for a period up to the earlier of (i) September 1, 2004, (ii) the closing of the acquisition without the use of the Bridge Facility or (iii) the sale of the
Pentair Tools Group.

The term loan to be made under the Bridge Facility (the
“Loan”), pursuant to a formal loan agreement to be negotiated, is contemplated to be available in a single disbursement upon closing of the WICOR acquisition and



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

is for the purpose of payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses. The closing of the Loan must occur before September 1, 2004. Any balance
due under the Loan is repayable in full, with accrued interest, no later than December 31, 2004. We will need to fund the repayment of the Bridge Facility by December 31, 2004 through a disposition of our Tools Group or through equity issuance.

We are seeking to obtain an amendment to the Credit Facility to allow an
increase to the ratio of total debt to EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) for the period of the Bridge Facility, which we believe will be granted by the banks participating in our Credit Facility. In addition,
during the period the Bridge Facility is outstanding, additional limitations will be placed on share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and sales of assets.

In 2004, interest expense will be primarily driven by the timing of the closing of the WICOR acquisition and any strategic alternative we pursue for our Tools segment.

Long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2003 matures as follows
(excluding anticipated effects of the new facility or term loan):

10.    Derivative and Financial Instruments

Cash-flow hedges

We have entered into interest rate swap agreements with a major financial institution to exchange variable rate
interest payment obligations for fixed rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. As of the end of 2003, we had variable to fixed rate swap agreements outstanding with an
aggregate notional amount of $40 million that expire in various amounts through June 2005. The swap agreements have a fixed interest rate of 6.31 percent. The fair value of this swap was a liability of $1.9 million at December 31, 2003.

The variable to fixed interest rate are designated as and are effective as cash-flow
hedges. The fair values of these swaps are recorded on the balance sheet, with changes in fair values included in other comprehensive income (OCI). Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the time the related
interest expense is recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs. We estimate $1.4 million of net derivative losses will be reclassified into earnings in 2004. No hedging relationships were de-designated during 2003.

Fair value hedge

In March 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert interest rate expense on $100 million of Senior notes for the term of the notes (maturing October 2009) from a 7.85 percent fixed
annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 2.49 percent. This swap agreement was designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge. In September 2002, we terminated this swap agreement and received $8.2 million.
This amount, net of accumulated amortization, is recorded as a premium to the carrying amount of the notes in the consolidated balance sheets and is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the Senior notes. The
$8.2 million was illustrated in the 2002 consolidated statement of cash flows as an increase in

other assets and liabilities

.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Concurrent with the termination of the interest rate swap, we entered into a new interest rate swap agreement to
effectively convert $100 million of Senior notes for the term of the notes (maturing October 2009) from a 7.85 percent fixed annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 3.69 percent. The fair value of the swap was a
liability of $1.0 million at December 31, 2003. This swap agreement has been designated and accounted for as a fair value hedge. Since this swap qualifies for the short-cut method under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of the swap (included
in

other long-term liabilities

in the consolidated balance sheets) are offset by changes in the fair value of the designated debt being hedged. Consequently, there is no impact on net income or shareholders’ equity.

Fair value of financial instruments

The recorded amounts and estimated fair values of financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, were as follows:

The following methods were used to
estimate the fair values of each class of financial instrument:

Ÿ

short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable, and short-term borrowings) — recorded amount
approximates fair value because of the short maturity period;

Ÿ

long-term debt, including current maturities — fair value is based on market quotes available for issuance of debt with similar terms;

Ÿ

interest rate swap agreements — fair value is based on market or dealer quotes; and

Ÿ

forward exchange agreements — fair value is not material due to the short term nature of these agreements

11.    Income Taxes

Income from continuing operations before income taxes consisted of the following:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The provision for income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following:

Reconciliation of the U.S.
statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate for continuing operations follows:

Deferred taxes arise because of
different treatment between financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets” (generally items that can be used
as a tax deduction or credit in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities” (generally items that we received a tax deduction for, but not yet been recorded in the consolidated statements of income).

United States income taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries. It is our intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so. Accordingly, we believe that any U.S. tax on repatriated earnings would be substantially offset by U.S.
foreign tax credits.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:

The determination of annual income tax
expense takes into consideration amounts, which may be needed to cover exposures for open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examined our U.S. federal income tax returns through 1997 with no material adjustments and is currently
auditing 1998 to 2001. We do not expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years; however, actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued.

At December 31, 2003, approximately $11.0 million non-U.S. tax losses were available for
carryforward. Valuation allowances in the amount of $1.5 million have been set up on these tax losses. No valuation allowance existed at December 31, 2002. We believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective countries to
allow us to fully recover the remainder of the tax losses.

We made net cash
payments for income taxes in fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 of $46.6 million, $20.4 million, and $3.2 million, respectively.

12.    Benefit Plans

Pension and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and
foreign defined-benefit pension and other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based principally on an employee’s years of service and/or compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also provide certain post-retirement health
care and life insurance benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a December 31 measurement date.

Obligations and Funded Status

The following tables present reconciliations of the benefit obligation of the plans, the plan assets of the pension plans, and the funded
status of the plans:

Of the $124.2 million underfunding at
December 31, 2003, $78.6 million relates to foreign pension plans and our supplemental executive retirement plan which are not commonly funded.

Amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets of:

The accumulated benefit obligation for
all defined benefit plans was $363,374 and $339,053 at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Weighted-average assumptions used

Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Discount rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of year based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was determined by matching our expected benefit
payments to payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call provisions. As a relatively young company, with a longer duration of liabilities than older companies with more mature
workforces, this produced a discount rate of 6.25 percent. There are no known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2004.

Expected rate of return

The expected
rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable year-to-year variance from actual returns. In developing the expected long-term rate of return, we considered our historical ten year
compounded return of 9.5 percent, with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader longer term market indices. In 2003, the pension plan assets yielded a positive return
of 24.8 percent, compared to negative returns of 10.5 percent and 4.1 percent in 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our expected rate of return in 2003 equaled 8.5 percent, which remained unchanged from 2002 and 2001. In 2003, the significant difference
between our expected return on plan assets of $24.7 million compared to our actual return on plan assets of $55.5 million was primarily due to the economic recovery and the resurgence of the financial markets. There are no known or anticipated
changes in our return assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2004.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a market-related valuation of assets which reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year
in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of assets and the actual return based on the market-related value of assets. Since the
market-related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year-period, the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension-related adjustments to equity

In 2002, our discount rate was lowered from 7.25 percent to 6.25 percent and we realized a negative 10.5 percent return on plan assets which caused the accumulated benefit obligation to exceed the fair market value of plan assets as of
December 31, 2002. This unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, plus the existing prepaid asset, was the primary cause of a $29.2 million net-of-tax charge to shareholders’ equity for 2002. The recovery of the financial markets in 2003 and
positive return on plan assets of 24.8 percent eliminated $20.9 million of the charge to shareholders’ equity. The charge did not impact earnings.

Net periodic benefit cost

Total net periodic pension benefits cost
was $15.7 million in 2003, $12.6 million in 2002, and $10.6 million in 2001. Total net periodic pension benefits cost is expected to be approximately $17.0 million in 2004. The increasing trend in net periodic pension cost from 2001 forward is
largely driven by increasing service and interest costs, the downturn in the financial markets in 2002 and 2001, and the decrease in the discount rate in 2002. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2004 has been estimated assuming a discount
rate of 6.25 percent and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.

Unrecognized pension losses

As of the December 31, 2003 measurement date, our pension plans have $75.7 million of cumulative unrecognized
losses of which approximately $20 million relates to the use of the market related value method and is not immediately subject to amortization. The remaining unrecognized loss, to the extent it exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, will
be amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active participants (currently approximately 12 years). The amount included a pension expense for loss amortization in 2003 was $0.5
million.

The assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31 are as follows:

The assumed health care cost trend
rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans. A one-percentage-point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects:

Plan Assets

Objective

The primary objective of our pension plans is to meet commitments to our employees at a reasonable cost to the company. This is primarily accomplished through growth of capital and safety of the funds invested. The
plans will therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital over inflation through appreciation of securities held and through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and interest income.

Asset allocation

Our actual overall asset allocation for the plans as compared to our investment policy goals is as follows:

(1)

Actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2003.

We regularly review our asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our
targeted allocation when considered appropriate. Our cash balance is higher than normal due to a $15.1 million contribution made to our domestic defined benefit plans as of December 31, 2003. From time to time, we may be outside our targeted ranges
by amounts we deem acceptable.

Equity securities include Pentair common stock
in the amount of $21.6 million (8 percent of total plan assets) and $16.3 million (7 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2003, and 2002, respectively.

Cash Flows

Contributions

Pension contributions in 2003 total $19.1 million, including $15.1 million of contributions to
domestic defined benefit pension plans. In 2002, pension contributions totaled $18.9 million, including $15.3 million of



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

contributions to domestic defined benefit plans. The contributions in 2003 and 2002 exceeded the minimum funding requirement. Our 2004 pension contributions
are expected to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million.

Savings
plan

We have a 401(k) plan (the plan) with an employee stock ownership (ESOP) bonus component, which covers certain union and nearly all-nonunion
U.S. employees who meet certain age requirements. Under the plan, eligible U.S. employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of their eligible compensation. Matching contributions are made in cash to employees who meet certain eligibility and
service requirements. Our matching contribution is based on our financial performance and ranges from 30 percent to 90 percent of eligible employee contributions, limited to 4 percent of compensation contributed by employees.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet certain service requirements
receive a discretionary ESOP contribution equal to 1.5 percent of annual eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the 401(k) and ESOP were approximately $9.8 million, $9.0 million, and $9.8 million in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively.

13.    Shareholders’ Equity

Authorized shares

We may issue
up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those shares as preferred stock.

Common share purchase rights

We have a ten-year Rights
Agreement dated July 31, 1995. Under this agreement, each outstanding share of our common stock has one common share purchase right attached to it and entitles the holder to purchase one share of our common stock, currently at a price of $80 per
share, subject to adjustment. However, these rights are not exercisable unless certain change-in-control events transpire, such as a person acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership of 15 percent or more of our outstanding
common stock.

The rights are redeemable by us for $0.01 per right until ten
business days after certain defined change-in-control events transpire, or at any time prior to the expiration of the rights.

Share repurchases

In 2003, the Board of Directors authorized
the development of a program and process to annually purchase up to 500,000 shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions to partially offset dilution due to normal grants of restricted shares and options to employees. In
2003, we repurchased 40,000 shares of our common stock. In 2002 and 2001, respectively, we repurchased no shares and 50,000 shares of our common stock under similar plans.

14.    Stock Plans

Omnibus stock incentive plan

In April 2003, the Omnibus Stock
Incentive Plan as Amended and Restated (the Plan) was approved. The Plan authorizes the issuance of additional shares of our common stock and extends through February 2006. The Plan allows for the granting of:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee (the Committee), which is made up of independent members of
our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards under the Plan are managerial, administrative, or other key employees who are in a position to make a material contribution to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of
Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards, establish certain terms and conditions of award grants, and take certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan provides
that no more than 20 percent of the total shares available for issuance under the Plan may be used to make awards other than stock options and limits the Committee’s authority to reprice awards or to cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

Incentive stock options

Under the Plan we may grant stock options to any eligible employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares on the dates the options
were granted. Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date.

Restricted stock, rights to restricted stock and ICUs

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded restricted shares or rights to restricted shares (awards) of our common stock and ICUs. Restrictions on awards and ICUs generally expire from two to five years after
issuance, subject to continuous employment and certain other conditions. Restricted stock awards are recorded at market value on the date of the grant as unearned compensation. Unearned compensation is shown as a reduction of shareholders’
equity in our consolidated financial statements and is being amortized to expense over the restriction period. The value of ICUs is based on a matrix, which takes into account growth in operating income and return on invested capital. Annual expense
for the value of restricted stock and ICUs was $4.6 million in 2003, $7.9 million in 2002, and $5.8 million in 2001.

Outside directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified
stock options are granted to outside directors under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the Directors Plan) with an exercise price equal to 100 percent of the market value of the shares on the dates the options were granted.
Options generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors Plan extends to January 2008.

15.    Business Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following business segments:

Ÿ

Water

— manufactures and markets essential products and systems used in the movement, treatment, storage and enjoyment of water. Water segment products include
water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and pool and spa equipment and accessories.

Ÿ

Enclosures

— designs, manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom enclosures that protect sensitive controls and components. Markets served include
industrial machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases, subracks,
backplanes, and associated thermal management systems.

Ÿ

Tools

— designs, manufactures and markets power tool products positioned at the mid to upper-end of the market and targets non-professional DIY, upscale
hobbyists, and professional end users. Tools segment products include woodworking machinery, portable power tools, power tool accessories, metal and stoneworking tools, pneumatic tools, compressors, generators, and pressure washers.

Ÿ

Other

— is primarily composed of unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations and
intercompany eliminations.

The accounting policies of our
operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. We evaluate performance based on the operating income of the segment and use a variety of ratios to measure performance. These results are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during the periods presented.

The following table presents certain geographic information:



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

Net sales are based on the location in which the sale originated. Long-lived assets represent property, plant, and
equipment, net of related depreciation.

We sell our products through various
distribution channels including home centers and retail chains. In our Water segment, two customers accounted for about 17 percent of segment sales in 2003 and 2002 and 18 percent of segment sales in 2001. In our Enclosure segment, no single
customer accounted for more than 10 percent of segment sales in 2003, 2002, or 2001. Three customers accounted for about 56 percent of our Tools segment net sales in 2003 and 62 percent and 58 percent, respectively, in 2002 and 2001. In 2003, sales
to The Home Depot, a major customer of our Tools segment, accounted for approximately 14 percent of total consolidated net sales. Sales to The Home Depot accounted for approximately 13 percent of total consolidated net sales in 2002 and 2001. If
these customers were lost, it would have a material adverse effect on our business.

16.    Commitments and Contingencies

Operating lease commitments

Net rental expense under operating leases follows:

Future minimum lease commitments
under non-cancelable operating leases, principally related to facilities, vehicles, and machinery and equipment, is as follows:

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental cleanups, in which our
current or former business units have generally been given

de

minimis

status. To date, none of these claims have resulted in cleanup costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our financial position or results of
operations. We have disposed of a number of businesses over the past ten years and in certain cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge Company
ammunition business in 1997, and the disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we have retained responsibility and potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of the
paper business and the ammunition business and have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities. We have recently settled one such claim in 2003 and our recorded accrual was
adequate.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues concerning a
limited number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition of Essef Corporation in 1999 that relates to operations no longer carried out at that site. We have established what we believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at
this and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will result in a material liability.



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both divested and acquired businesses. When it has been
possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2003, our reserve for such
environmental liabilities was approximately $11.2 million, measured on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental cleanup costs and
liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current reserves.

Litigation

We are occasionally a party to litigation arising in the normal course of
business. We regularly analyze current information and, as necessary, provide accruals for probable liabilities based on the expected eventual disposition of these matters. We believe the effect on our consolidated results of operations and
financial position, if any, for the disposition of all currently pending matters will not be material.

Warranties and guarantees

From time to time in connection with the disposition of businesses or product
lines, Pentair may agree to indemnify purchasers for various potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or other obligations. The subject matter, amounts, and duration of
any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to transaction. Pentair currently has outstanding indemnification obligations for environmental matters relating to certain sold
businesses that have four- to five-year indemnification periods, and one that lasts indefinitely. Other currently outstanding indemnity obligations have a one-year duration. The maximum potential payment for these obligations is unlimited.

We accrue for costs associated with guarantees when it is probable that a
liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts, and where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely, the minimum
is accrued.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products.
Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a review of historical warranty and service claim experience. Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical experience warrant. In addition, we incur discretionary costs to
service our products in connection with product performance issues.

The
changes in the carrying amount of service and product warranties for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 are as follows:

Stand-by letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly in our pump business, we are required to commit to bonds that require payments to our customers
for any non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds fluctuates



Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries

Notes to consolidated financial statements — (continued)

with the value of our projects in process and in our backlog. In, addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of credit to secure our performance to third
parties under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled $35.0 million and $19.8 million, respectively.

18.    Subsequent Events

On February 3, 2004, we entered into an agreement to acquire WICOR Inc. (“WICOR”), a unit of Wisconsin Energy Corporation,
Milwaukee, Wisconsin. WICOR, which manufactures water system, filtration and pool equipment products under the Sta-Rite, SHURflo and Hypro brands, generated sales of approximately $746 million in 2003. The $850 million cash transaction, which we
plan to complete in the second or third quarter of 2004, is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions and regulatory approvals. As part of the transaction, we will assume approximately $24 million of WICOR debt.

We expect to fund the WICOR acquisition through our currently available and newly committed
lines of credit. We have obtained a commitment, subject to customary conditions, in the aggregate amount of $850 million (the “Bridge Facility”) for the payment of the purchase price. The Bridge Facility is available for a period up to the
earlier of (i) September 1, 2004, (ii) the closing of the acquisition without the use of the Bridge Facility or (iii) the sale of the Pentair Tools Group.

The term loan to be made under the Bridge Facility (the “Loan”), pursuant to a formal loan agreement to be negotiated, is contemplated to be available in a
single disbursement upon closing of the WICOR acquisition and is for the purpose of payment of the purchase price and related fees and expenses. The closing of the Loan must occur before September 1, 2004. Any balance due under the Loan is repayable
in full, with accrued interest, no later than December 31, 2004. We will need to fund the repayment of the Bridge Facility by December 31, 2004 through a disposition of our Tools Group through equity issuance.

We also announced that we have engaged Goldman Sachs to explore strategic alternatives for
our Tools segment, comprising the Porter-Cable, Delta, DeVilbiss Air Power Company, Oldham Saw and Flex businesses with $1,081.4 million in net sales in 2003.

We are seeking to obtain an amendment to the Credit Facility for our most restrictive financial covenant to increase our required ratio of total debt to EBITDA
(Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) as a result of the Bridge Facility, which we believe will be granted by the banks participating in our Credit Facility. In addition, during the period the Bridge Facility is
outstanding, additional limitations will be placed on share repurchases, dividends, acquisitions and sales of assets.

In February 2004, we signed a letter of intent to purchase the remaining 51 percent ownership interest in the joint venture operations of a long time Asian supplier for
bench top power tools.
