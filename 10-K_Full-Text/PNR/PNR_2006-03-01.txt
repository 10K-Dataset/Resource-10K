BUSINESS
    AND PRODUCTS

WATER
    GROUP

Our Water Group is a global leader in providing innovative
    products and systems used worldwide in the movement, treatment,

Customers

Our Water Group distributes its products through wholesale
    distributors, retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. Information regarding
    significant customers in our Water Group is contained in
    ITEM 8, Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End user demand for pool/spa equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from March to July. The
    magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by effective
    use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales
    programs (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly
    related to heavy flooding and droughts.



Competition

Our Water Group faces numerous domestic and international
    competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources.
    Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are continuing
    trends in the water industry. Competition in commercial and
    residential pump markets focuses on brand names, product
    performance, quality, and price. While home center and national
    retailers are important for residential lines of water and
    wastewater pumps, they are much less important for commercial
    pumps. For municipal pumps, competition focuses on performance
    to meet required specifications, service, and price. Competition
    in water treatment and filtration components focuses on product
    performance and design, quality, delivery, and price. For pool
    and spa equipment, there are a significant number of
    competitors. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative
    and high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We
    believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality
    also contribute to our continuing industry penetration.

TECHNICAL
    PRODUCTS GROUP

Our Technical Products Group, formerly referred to as our
    Enclosures Group, is a global leader in the global enclosures
    market that designs, manufactures, and markets standard,
    modified, and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive
    controls, components; thermal management products; and
    accessories. We have identified a target market in excess of
    $30 billion. Our Technical Products Group focuses its
    business portfolio on four primary industries:
    Commercial & Industrial (55% of segment sales), Telecom
    and Datacom (25% of segment sales), Electronics (15% of segment
    sales), and Networking (5% of segment sales). The primary brand
    names for the Technical Products Group are:
    Hoffman

®

,
    Schroff

®

,
    Pentair Electronic
    Packaging

tm

,
    and
    Taunus

tm

.

The thermal businesses we acquired in December 2005 go to market
    under four brand names:
    McLean

®

,
    Electronic
    Solutions

tm

,
    Birtcher

tm

,
    and Aspen
    Motion

tm

.

Products and related accessories of the Technical Products Group
    include metallic and composite enclosures, cabinets, cases,
    subracks, backplanes, heat exchangers, and blowers. Applications
    served include industrial machinery, data communications,
    networking, telecommunications, test and measurement,
    automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics.

Customers

Our Technical Products Group distributes its products through
    original equipment manufacturers, electrical and data
    contractors, and electrical and electronic components
    distributors. Information regarding significant customers in our
    Technical Products Group is contained in ITEM 8,
    Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements,
    included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our Technical Products Group is not significantly impacted by
    seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the technical products markets can be intense,
    particularly in telecom and datacom markets, where product
    design, prototyping, global supply, price competition, and
    customer service are significant factors. Our Technical Products
    Group has continued to focus on cost control and improving
    profitability on a sequential quarter to quarter basis. Recent
    growth in the Technical Products Group is a result of continued
    channel penetration, growth in targeted market segments, new
    product development, geographic expansion, acquisitions, and
    overall market growth. Consolidation, globalization, and
    outsourcing are visible trends in the technical products
    marketplace and typically play to the strengths of a large and
    globally positioned supplier. We believe our Technical Products
    Group has the broadest array of enclosures products available
    for commercial and industrial uses.

Business segment and geographical financial information is
    contained in ITEM 8, Note 14 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

RECENT
    DEVELOPMENTS

Growth
    of Our Business

We continually look at each of our businesses to determine
    whether they fit with our evolving strategic vision. Our primary
    focus is on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth
    opportunities, especially in international markets. We seek
    growth through product and service innovation, market expansion,
    and acquisitions. Acquisitions have played an important part in
    the growth of our business, and we expect acquisitions will
    continue to be an important part of our growth in the future.

Acquisitions

On December 1, 2005, we acquired McLean Thermal Management,
    Aspen Motion Technologies, and Electronic Solutions businesses
    from APW, Ltd. (collectively, “Thermal”) for
    $140.0 million, including a cash payment of
    $138.9 million and transaction costs of $1.1 million.
    These businesses provide thermal management solutions and
    integration services to the telecommunications, data
    communications, medical, and security markets as part of our
    Technical Products Group. Goodwill recorded as part of the
    initial purchase price allocation was $93.7 million, all of
    which is tax deductible. Preliminary estimates of identifiable
    intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition were
    $18.9 million, including definite-lived intangibles, such
    as proprietary technology and customer relationships, of
    $9.8 million with a weighted average amortization period of
    10.0 years. We continue to evaluate the purchase price
    allocation for the Thermal acquisition, including intangible
    assets, contingent liabilities, plant rationalization costs, and
    property, plant and equipment. We expect to revise the purchase
    price allocation as better information becomes available in 2006.

On February 23, 2005, we acquired certain assets of Delta
    Environmental Products, Inc. and affiliates (collectively,
    “DEP”), a privately-held company, for
    $10.3 million, including a cash payment of
    $10.0 million, transaction costs of $0.2 million, and
    debt assumed of $0.1 million. The DEP product line
    addresses the water and wastewater markets and is part of our
    Water Group. Goodwill recorded as part of the initial purchase
    price allocation was $9.3 million, all of which is tax
    deductible.

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of
    all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR, Inc.
    (“WICOR”) from Wisconsin Energy Corporation
    (“WEC”) for $874.7 million, including a cash
    payment of $871.1 million, transaction costs of
    $11.2 million, and debt assumed of $21.6 million, less
    a favorable final purchase price adjustment of
    $14.0 million and less cash acquired of $15.2 million.
    This includes an additional $0.4 million in transaction
    costs recorded in the first three quarters of 2005. WICOR
    manufactures water system, filtration, and pool equipment
    products primarily under the
    STA-RITE

®

,
    SHURflo

®

and
    Hypro

®

brands.

On December 31, 2003, we acquired all of the common stock
    of Everpure, Inc. (“Everpure”), from United States
    Filter Corporation, a unit of Veolia Environnement, for
    $218.9 million in cash, less cash acquired of
    $5.5 million and transaction costs of $2.2 million.
    Everpure is a leading global provider of water filtration
    products for the commercial and consumer sectors.

During 2003, we also completed four product line acquisitions in
    our Water Group for total consideration of $21.4 million in
    cash including transaction costs: Hydrotemp Manufacturing Co.,
    Inc., Letro Products, Inc. and certain assets of TwinPumps,
    Inc., and K&M Plastics, Inc.

Also refer to ITEM 7, Management’s Discussion and
    Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 2 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Discontinued
    Operations/Divestitures

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we
    completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”) for
    approximately $796.8 million in cash, including a
    $21.8 million interim net asset value increase, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. The Tools Group was comprised of the
    Porter-Cable

®

,
    Delta

®

,
    DeVilbiss Air Power, Oldham Saw, and
    FLEX

®

brands, among others. We used the proceeds from the Tools Group
    sale and borrowings under our credit facility to repay, on
    October 4, 2004, an



$850 million bridge facility used to acquire WICOR. In the
    fourth quarter of 2004, we recorded a loss on the disposal of
    the Tools Group of $6.0 million, net of a tax provision of
    $9.0 million. In July 2005, we paid $10.4 million to
    BDK in purchase price adjustments related to the sale of our
    former Tools Group. We currently have an outstanding dispute
    with BDK over the net asset value of the Tools Group and may be
    required to repay additional proceeds. We believe our accrual at
    December 31, 2005 is an adequate reserve amount for any
    potential liability. We expect resolution of this matter in the
    first quarter of 2006.

In 2001, we completed the sale of the Service Equipment
    businesses (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) to
    Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of
    $18.2 million and we completed the sale of Lincoln
    Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan),
    other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial
    for total consideration of $78.4 million, including the
    retention of a preferred stock interest. In January 2003, we
    paid $2.4 million for a final adjustment to the selling
    price related to the disposition of Lincoln Industrial, which
    was offset by a previously established reserve. In the fourth
    quarter of 2003, we reported an additional loss from
    discontinued operations of $2.9 million primarily due to a
    reduction in estimated proceeds related to exiting two remaining
    facilities.

    Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 3 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

    REGARDING ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS

Backlog

Our backlog of orders from continuing operations as of

%

The $6.9 million decrease in Water Group backlog was
    primarily due to the timing of filtration and pool product
    orders. The $31.4 million increase in Technical Products
    Group backlog reflects the acquisition of the thermal management
    businesses from APW, as well as order growth in the Group’s
    Asian businesses, particularly China. Due to the relatively
    short manufacturing cycle and general industry practice,
    backlog, which typically represents approximately 30 days
    of shipments, is not deemed to be a significant item for our
    business. A substantial portion of our revenues result from
    orders received and product sold in the same month. We expect
    that most of our backlog at December 31, 2005 will be
    filled in 2006.

Research
    and Development

We conduct research and development activities in our own
    facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new
    products, product applications, and manufacturing processes.
    Research and development expenditures during 2005, 2004, and
    2003 were $46.0 million, $31.5 million, and
    $22.9 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7,
    and in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Raw
    Materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of our
    products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel,
    electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies),
    and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of
    raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution
    through our sales channels.



The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are
    purchased on the open market, and the majority are available
    through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not
    experienced any significant work stoppages to-date due to
    shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments,
    principally price commitments, for the purchase of various
    component parts and raw materials and believe that it is
    unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated
    prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices
    are available for most materials for which long-term commitments
    exist, and we believe that the termination of any of these
    commitments would not have a material adverse effect on
    operations.

Certain commodities, such as steel and resin, are subject to
    market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these
    fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term
    agreements with

escalator/de-escalator

clauses. Prices for raw materials, such as steel, carbon, and
    resins, may continue to trend higher in the future.

Intellectual
    Property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. However, we do not regard
    our business as being materially dependent upon any single
    patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer
    relationship, trade mark, trade name, or brand name.

Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire
    or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with
    their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of
    patents, patent applications, and license agreements to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of December 31, 2005, Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries
    employed an aggregate of approximately 14,700 people worldwide.
    Total employees in the United States were approximately 10,700,
    of whom approximately 900 are represented by six different trade
    unions having collective bargaining agreements. Generally, labor
    relations have been satisfactory.

Captive
    Insurance Subsidiary

We insure general and product liability, property, workers’
    compensation, and automobile liability risks through our
    regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary, Penwald
    Insurance Company (Penwald). Reserves for policy claims are
    established based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses.
    Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by third parties,
    such as liabilities retained from acquired businesses,

pre-1992

liabilities and those of certain foreign operations, are
    established without regard to the availability of insurance.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Item 1A.

Risk
    Factors

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and
    warnings before making an investment decision. If any of the
    risks described below actually occur, our business, financial
    condition, results of operations or prospects could be
    materially adversely affected. In that case, the price of our
    securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your
    investment. You should also refer to the other information set
    forth in this document.

Demand
    for our products will be affected by general economic
    conditions.

Demand for our residential and commercial products is influenced
    by many economic conditions, including but not limited to new
    construction activity and the level of repair and remodeling
    activity. The level of new construction and repair and
    remodeling activity is affected by a number of factors beyond
    our control, such as the overall strength of the economy
    (including confidence in the economy by our customers), the
    strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets,
    institutional building activity, the age of existing housing
    stock, unemployment rates, availability of consumer financing
    and interest rates. Any declines in new housing or commercial
    construction starts or demand for replacement building and home
    improvement products may adversely impact us, and there can be
    no assurance that any such adverse effects would not be material
    and would not continue for an indeterminate period of time.
    Further, while we attempt to minimize our exposure to economic
    or market fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets
    and geographic regions, we cannot assure you that a significant
    or sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic
    region would not have a material adverse effect on us.

Our
    businesses operate in highly competitive markets, so we may be
    forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs.

Our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of
    their respective markets. Competition may force us to cut prices
    or to incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete
    on the basis of product design, quality, availability,
    performance, customer service and price. Present or future
    competitors may have greater financial, technical or other
    resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected
    business or businesses. We cannot assure you that these and
    other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
    results of operations.

Our
    inability to sustain consistent organic growth could adversely
    affect our financial performance.

In 2005, our organic growth was generated in part from expanding
    international sales, entering new distribution channels, and
    introducing new products. To grow more rapidly than our end
    markets, we will have to continue to expand our geographic
    reach, further diversify our distribution channels, continue to
    introduce new products, and increase sales of existing products
    to our customer base. We may not be able to successfully meet
    those challenges, which could adversely affect our ability to
    sustain consistent organic growth. If we are unable to sustain
    consistent organic growth, we will be less likely to meet our
    stated revenue growth targets, which could adversely affect our
    net income growth, and, in turn, the market price of our stock.

Our
    inability to complete or successfully complete and integrate
    acquisitions could adversely affect our financial
    performance.

A significant percentage of our net sales growth in 2005 and
    2004 was generated as a result of acquisitions completed during
    those periods, including our acquisition of WICOR and Everpure.
    We may not be able to sustain this level of growth from
    acquisition activity in the future. We intend to continue to
    evaluate strategic acquisitions primarily in our current
    business segments, and we may consider acquisitions outside of
    these segments as well. Our ability to expand through
    acquisitions is subject to various risks, including the
    following:

•

increased competition for acquisitions, especially in the water
    industry;

•

higher acquisition prices;



•

lack of suitable acquisition candidates in targeted product or
    market areas;

•

diversion of management time and attention to acquisitions and
    acquired businesses;

•

inability to integrate acquired businesses effectively or
    profitably; and

•

inability to achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits
    from acquisitions.

Acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our
    operating results, particularly in the fiscal quarters
    immediately following the acquisitions, while we attempt to
    integrate operations of the acquired businesses into our
    operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not achieve
    the levels of profitability originally anticipated.

Material
    cost inflation could adversely affect our results of
    operations.

We are experiencing material cost inflation in a number of our
    businesses. We are striving for greater productivity
    improvements and implementing selective increases in selling
    prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as
    steel, resins, ocean freight and fuel, health care and
    insurance. We also are continuing to implement our excellence in
    operations initiatives in order to continuously reduce our
    costs. We cannot assure you, however, that these actions will be
    successful to manage our costs or increase our productivity.
    Continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to
    generate cost savings or improve productivity may negatively
    impact our results of operations.

Seasonality
    of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our
    financial results.

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool/spa equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from March to July. The
    magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by effective
    use of the distribution channel by employing advance sales
    programs (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by water patterns particularly
    related to heavy flooding and droughts. We cannot assure you
    that seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Intellectual
    property challenges may hinder product development and
    marketing.

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. Intellectual property
    protection, however, may not preclude competitors from
    developing products similar to ours or from challenging our
    names or products. Over the past few years, we have noticed an
    increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use
    conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a
    means to compete. Patent and trademark challenges increase our
    costs to develop, engineer and market our products.

Our
    results of operations may be negatively impacted by
    litigation.

Our business exposes us to potential litigation, especially
    product liability suits that are inherent in the design,
    manufacture, and sale of our products. While we currently
    maintain what we believe to be suitable product liability
    insurance, we cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain
    this insurance on acceptable terms or that this insurance will
    provide adequate protection against potential liabilities. In
    addition, we self-insure a portion of product liability claims.
    A series of successful claims against us could materially and
    adversely affect our product reputation and our financial
    condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

We may
    be required to make payments in respect of businesses that we
    have sold.

We have sold a number of businesses over the last ten years,
    including the sale of our former Tools Group to BDK in October
    2004. In this and other dispositions, we typically agree to
    indemnify the buyers with respect to certain matters relating to
    the businesses that we have sold, and we may from time to time
    be required to make payments to the buyers under those
    indemnities. To the extent we are required to make any



such payments in the future, those payments could be
    substantial, which could require us to borrow additional amounts
    at unfavorable borrowing terms and cause a significant decrease
    in our liquidity, both of which could severely harm our business.

The
    availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on
    our continued growth.

Our plans to continue our growth in our chosen markets will
    require additional capital for future acquisitions, capital
    expenditures for existing businesses, growth of working capital,
    and continued international and regional expansion. In the past,
    we have financed our growth primarily through debt financings.
    Any significant future acquisitions will require us to expand
    our debt financing resources or to issue equity securities. Our
    financial results may be adversely affected if interest costs
    under our debt financings are higher than the income generated
    by acquisitions or other internal growth. In addition, future
    acquisitions could be dilutive to your equity investment if we
    issue additional stock to fund acquisitions. We cannot be
    assured that we will be able to issue equity securities or to
    obtain future debt financing at favorable terms. Without
    sufficient financing, we will not be able to pursue our growth
    strategy, which will limit our growth and revenues in the future.

Our
    international operations are subject to foreign market and
    currency fluctuation risks.

We expect the percentage of sales outside of North America to
    increase in the future. Over the past few years, the economies
    of many of the foreign countries in which we do business have
    had slower growth than the U.S. economy. The European Union
    currently accounts for the majority of our foreign sales and
    income. Our most significant European market is Germany, where
    the capital goods market has been very slow. We cannot predict
    how changing European market conditions will impact our
    financial results.

We are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign
    currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results.
    As of December 31, 2005, we held immaterial positions in
    foreign exchange-forward contracts.

We are
    exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from
    operating a multinational business.

Sales outside of North America, including export sales from
    North American businesses, accounted for approximately 22% of
    our net sales in 2005. Further, certain of our businesses obtain
    raw materials and finished goods from foreign suppliers.
    Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic
    and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous
    countries. These risks include:

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing
    requirements;

•

tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the
    U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign
    earnings;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other
    restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and
    the application of foreign labor regulations;

•

the protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may
    be more difficult;

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations; and

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in
    countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

Our business success depends in part on our ability to
    anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We
    cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a
    material adverse effect on our international operations or on
    our business as a whole.



We are
    exposed to potential environmental liabilities and
    litigation.

Compliance with environmental regulations could require us to
    discharge environmental liabilities, increase the cost of
    manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect our
    business, financial condition and results of operations. We are
    subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
    regulations governing public and worker health and safety and
    the indoor and outdoor environment. Any violations of these laws
    by us could cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that
    could harm our operating results and cause our business to
    suffer. We are also required to comply with various
    environmental laws and maintain permits, some of which are
    subject to discretionary renewal from time to time, for many of
    our businesses, and we could suffer if we are unable to renew
    existing permits or to obtain any additional permits that we may
    require.

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (PRPs) in a number of environmental
    clean-ups relating to our current or former business units. We
    have disposed of a number of businesses over the last ten years
    and, in certain cases, we have retained responsibility and
    potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We
    have received claims for indemnification from certain
    purchasers. We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the
    future for existing business units, as well as both divested and
    acquired businesses.

We cannot ensure that environmental requirements will not change
    or become more stringent over time or that our eventual
    environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Provisions
    of our Restated Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Minnesota
    law could deter takeover attempts.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under
    Minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent
    or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.

Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include
    provisions relating to the election, appointment and removal of
    directors, as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting
    requirements which could delay, prevent or make more difficult a
    merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control.
    In addition, our common share purchase rights could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us, which could deter some acquirers from making
    takeover proposals or tender offers. Also, the Minnesota
    Business Corporations Act contains control share acquisition and
    business combination provisions which could delay, prevent or
    make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
    other change of control. Our shareholders might view any such a
    transaction as being in their best interests since the
    transaction could result in a higher stock price than the
    current market price for our common stock.

Item 2.

Properties

Our principal executive office is in leased premises located in
    Golden Valley, Minnesota. Our Water Group manufacturing
    operations are carried out at approximately 25 plants located
    throughout the United States and at 22 plants located in 11
    other countries. In addition, our Water Group has 54
    distribution facilities and 17 sales offices located in numerous
    countries throughout the world. Our Technical Products Group
    operations are carried out at approximately 8 plants located
    throughout the United States and 8 plants located in 6 other
    countries. In addition, our Technical Products Group has 9
    distribution facilities and 28 sales offices located in numerous
    countries throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their
    purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.



Item 3.

Legal
    Proceedings

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal
    Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental
    clean-ups, in which our current or former business units have
    generally been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of
    these claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses over the last ten years and in certain
    cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper
    Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of
    the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the
    disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition
    of the Tools Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and
    potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We
    have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of
    the paper business and the ammunition business and have
    established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
    potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.
    We settled some of the claims in 2005 and 2003 and our recorded
    accrual was adequate.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relates to operations no
    longer carried out at that site. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this
    and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs
    will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When it is probable and it is
    possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability, with
    respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our
    reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately
    $6.4 million and $9.4 million, respectively, measured
    on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental
    requirements will not change or become more stringent over time
    or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.



Product
    Liability Claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald
    records a liability for these claims based on actuarial
    projections of ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals
    covering the claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when
    it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount
    of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing
    information. The accruals are adjusted periodically as
    additional information becomes available. We have not
    experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the
    severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal
    injury claims.

Horizon
    Litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs,
    a class action, and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise
    Lines, Inc. (Celebrity) were brought against Essef Corporation
    (Essef) and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition
    of Essef in August 1999. Celebrity has alleged that it had
    sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the M/V Horizon
    while it was dry-docked.

The claims against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were
    based upon the allegation that Essef designed, manufactured, and
    marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a
    part of the spa system on the Horizon, and allegations that the
    spa and filters contained Legionnaire’s disease bacteria
    that infected certain passengers on cruises from December 1993
    through July 1994.

The individual and class claims by passengers were tried and
    resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the
    part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister
    company, Fantasia (together 30%).

After expiration of post-trial appeals, we paid all outstanding
    punitive damage awards of $7.0 million in the Horizon
    cases, plus interest of approximately $1.6 million in
    January 2004. We had reserved for the amount of punitive damages
    awarded at the time of the Essef acquisition. A reserve for the
    $1.6 million interest cost was recorded in 2003. All of the
    personal injury cases have now been resolved through either
    settlement or trial.

The only remaining unresolved claims in this case are those
    brought by Celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak.
    Celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and
    costs for prior litigation as well as

out-of-pocket

losses, lost profits, and loss of business enterprise value.
    Discovery commenced late in 2004, and was completed in August
    2005. Celebrity’s claims for damages exceed
    $185 million. Assuming matters of causation, standing,
    contribution and proof are decided against it, Essef’s
    experts believe that damages should amount to no more than
    approximately $16 to $25 million. Dispositive motions in
    this matter were filed in August 2005, which were decided in
    December 2005. Celebrity’s motion for indemnity from Essef
    for payments made by Celebrity for passenger claims of
    approximately $2.3 million was denied. Essef’s motion
    for dismissal of certain damage claims was denied without
    prejudice to renewal in conjunction with both parties’
    motions to exclude certain expert testimony. We expect these
    motions to be adjudicated in March 2006. Trial has been
    scheduled for April 24, 2006. We believe our reserves for
    any liability to Celebrity are adequate and intend to vigorously
    defend against these claims.

PART II

Item 5.

Market
    for Registrant’s Common Stock, Related Security Holder
    Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

Pentair’s common stock is listed for trading on the New
    York Stock Exchange and trades under the symbol “PNR.”
    As of December 31, 2005, there were 3,922 shareholders
    of record.

Effective January 1, 2002 we adopted
    SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other Intangible
    Assets.

This standard requires goodwill and intangible
    assets deemed to have an indefinite life no longer be amortized.
    This standard did not require restatement of prior period
    amounts to be consistent with the current year presentation and
    therefore, we have not made any adjustments to the historical
    financial information presented. However, we have provided
    supplemental tax and diluted EPS information as we believe it is
    necessary to the understanding of our financial performance
    trend.

(2)

Calculated using a

13-month

average.

In 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R,

Share Based Payment

,
    which requires the fair value of stock options to be expensed.
    We did not restate prior period amounts to be consistent with
    the current year presentation and therefore we have not made any
    adjustments to prior year information presented. The after tax
    expense impact of adoption was $12.0 million or ($0.12)
    diluted EPS.



In 2004, we divested our Tools Group. Our financial statements
    have been restated to reflect the Tools Group as a discontinued
    operation for all periods presented. The 2004 results reflect a
    pre-tax gain on the sale of the Tools Group of $3.0 million
    ($6.0 million loss after tax).

In 2002, capital expenditures from discontinued operations
    included $23.0 million for the acquisition of a previously
    leased facility.

In 2000, we discontinued our Equipment segment (Century Mfg.
    Co./Lincoln Automotive and Lincoln Industrial businesses). Our
    financial statements have been restated to reflect the Equipment
    segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
    The 2001 results reflected a pre-tax loss on the sale of these
    businesses of $36.3 million ($24.6 million loss after
    tax).

In 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities

, resulting in
    an increase to other assets and other noncurrent liabilities of
    $7.5 million and $0.8 million, respectively, and a
    cumulative transition adjustment of $6.7 million in OCI.
    The transition adjustment relates to our hedging activities
    through December 31, 2000. Prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 133, financial instruments designated as
    hedges were not recorded in the financial statements, but cash
    flows from such contracts were recorded as adjustments to
    earnings as the hedged items affected earnings.

In 2001, cost of goods sold included $1.0 million related
    to the 2001 restructuring charge for our Technical Products
    segment.

In 2000, operations reflected a non-cash pre-tax cumulative
    effect of accounting change related to revenue recognition that
    reduced income by $0.03 million, net of tax.

Our accounting policy prior to the adoption of
    SFAS No. 142 was to amortize goodwill on a
    straight-line basis over the estimated future periods to be
    benefited, principally between 25 and 40 years.

Reference should be made to the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
    Financial Condition and Results of Operations.



Item 7.

Management’s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
    Operations

This report contains statements that we believe to be
    “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
    Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
    Forward-looking statements give our current expectations or
    forecasts of future events. Forward-looking statements generally
    can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology such
    as “may,” “will,” “expect,”
    “intend,” “estimate,”
    “anticipate,” “believe,”
    “project,” or “continue,” or the negative
    thereof or similar words. From time to time, we also may provide
    oral or written forward-looking statements in other materials we
    release to the public. Any or all of our forward-looking
    statements in this report and in any public statements we make
    could be materially different from actual results. They can be
    affected by assumptions we might make or by known or unknown
    risks or uncertainties. Consequently, we cannot guarantee any
    forward-looking statements. Investors are cautioned not to place
    undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Investors
    should also understand that it is not possible to predict or
    identify all such factors and should not consider the following
    list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and
    uncertainties.

The following factors may impact the achievement of
    forward-looking statements:

•

changes in general economic and industry conditions, such as:

•

the strength of product demand;

•

the intensity of competition, including foreign competitors;

•

pricing pressures;

•

market acceptance of new product introductions and enhancements;

•

the introduction of new products and enhancements by competitors;

•

our ability to maintain and expand relationships with large
    customers;

•

our ability to source raw material commodities from our
    suppliers without interruption and at reasonable prices;

•

our ability to source components from third parties, in
    particular foreign manufacturers, without interruption and at
    reasonable prices; and

•

the financial condition of our customers;

•

our ability to identify, complete, and integrate acquisitions
    successfully and to realize expected synergies on our
    anticipated timetable;

•

changes in our business strategies, including acquisition,
    divestiture, and restructuring activities;

•

governmental and regulatory policies;

•

general economic and political conditions, such as political
    instability, the rate of economic growth in our principal
    geographic or product markets, or fluctuations in exchange rates;

•

changes in operating factors, such as continued improvement in
    manufacturing activities and the achievement of related
    efficiencies, cost reductions, and inventory risks due to shifts
    in market demand and costs associated with moving production
    overseas;

•

unanticipated developments that could occur with respect to
    contingencies such as litigation, intellectual property matters,
    product liability exposures and environmental matters;

•

our ability to continue to successfully generate savings from
    our excellence in operations initiatives consisting of lean
    enterprise, supply management and cash flow practices;

•

our ability to accurately evaluate the effects of contingent
    liabilities such as taxes, product liability, environmental, and
    other claims;

•

our ability to access capital markets and obtain anticipated
    financing under favorable terms; and



•

other risks specifically discussed under the heading “Risk
    Factors” under Part I of this report.

The foregoing factors are not exhaustive, and new factors may
    emerge or changes to the foregoing factors may occur that would
    impact our business. We assume no obligation, and disclaim any
    duty, to update the forward-looking statements in this report.

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company
    comprised of two operating segments: Water and Technical
    Products. Our Water Group is a global leader in providing
    innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement,
    treatment, storage, and enjoyment of water. Our Technical
    Products Group is a global leader in the global enclosures
    market that designs, manufactures, and markets standard,
    modified, and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive
    controls, components; thermal management products; and
    accessories. In 2006, our Water Group and Technical Products
    Group are forecasted to generate approximately 70 percent
    and 30 percent of total revenues, respectively.

Our Water Group has progressively become a more important part
    of our business portfolio with sales increasing from
    $100 million in 1995 to approximately $2.1 billion in
    2005. We believe the water industry is structurally attractive
    as a result of a growing demand for clean water and the large
    global market size (of which we have identified a target
    industry segment totaling $50 billion). Our vision is to
    become a leading global provider of innovative products and
    systems used in the movement, treatment, storage, and enjoyment
    of water.

As of July 31, 2004, we continued the expansion of our
    global footprint in the water equipment industry through the
    acquisition of WICOR, a manufacturer of pumps, filtration, and
    pool equipment marketed primarily under the
    STA-RITE

®

,
    SHURflo

®

,
    and
    Hypro

®

brands. We initially funded the payment of the purchase price
    and related fees and expenses of the WICOR acquisition with an
    $850 million committed line of credit (the “Bridge
    Facility”) and through additional borrowings available
    under our existing credit facility. We used the proceeds from
    the Tools Group sale to repay, on October 4, 2004, the
    $850 million Bridge Facility.

We realized $36 million in synergies net of integration
    costs in the first full year of ownership with respect to the
    WICOR acquisition via key initiatives including facility
    rationalizations, lean enterprise, material cost savings, and
    administrative cost savings. We also expect to achieve
    significant working capital reductions, net fixed asset
    reductions, and revenue synergies from cross-selling
    opportunities during the first two years of ownership as a
    result of the acquisition. Integration of the former WICOR
    businesses proceeded as expected during 2005 with 17 facilities
    closed or consolidated to date.

Our Technical Products Group operates in a large global market
    with significant potential for growth in industry segments such
    as defense, security, medical, and networking. We believe we
    have the largest enclosures industrial and commercial
    distribution network in North America and highest enclosures
    brand recognition in the industry. From mid-2001 through
    mid-2003, the Technical Products Group experienced significantly
    lower sales volumes as a result of severely reduced capital
    spending in the industrial and commercial markets and
    over-capacity and weak demand in the datacom and telecom
    markets. In 2004 and 2005, sales volumes increased due to the
    addition of new distributors, new products, and higher demand in
    all targeted markets. In addition, through the success of our
    PIMS initiatives, we have increased Technical Products segment
    margins for sixteen consecutive quarters.

Key
    Trends and Uncertainties

The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial
    performance in 2005 and may impact our results in the future:

•

In 2005, we achieved approximately six percent sales growth on a
    proforma basis, assuming we had acquired WICOR at the beginning
    of 2004, excluding the recent Thermal acquisition, and excluding
    the effects of foreign currency translation.



•

We plan to drive strategic growth initiatives in both our Water
    and Technical Products platforms, with particular emphasis on
    international growth.

•

We expect our operations to continue to benefit from our PIMS
    initiative: including strategy deployment; lean enterprise with
    special focus on sourcing and supply management, cash
    management, and lean operations; and IGNITE, our process to
    drive organic growth.

•

We are experiencing material cost inflation in a number of our
    businesses. We are striving for greater productivity
    improvements and implementing selective increases in selling
    prices to help mitigate cost increases in base materials such as
    steel, resins, ocean freight and fuel, health care, and
    insurance.

•

Free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operating
    activities less capital expenditures, including both continuing
    and discontinued operations, plus proceeds from sale of property
    and equipment, exceeded $200 million for the fourth
    consecutive year and is expected to be approximately
    $200 million in 2006. See our discussion of

Other
    financial measures

under the caption “Liquidity and
    Capital Resources” of this report.

•

In 2005, we experienced favorable foreign currency effects in
    the first half of the year and unfavorable in the second half of
    the year. Overall, we experienced a slightly favorable foreign
    currency effect in 2005. Our currency effect is primarily for
    the U.S. dollar against the Euro, which may not trend
    favorably in the future.

•

We expect our overall effective tax rate to be 36 percent
    in 2006. As a part of our acquisition and international
    strategies, we are pursuing rate reduction opportunities, which
    could improve our effective tax rate.

•

As anticipated, our Water Group operating income margins in each
    of the first two quarters of 2005 were lower compared to the
    prior year comparable periods due to the lower former WICOR
    operating margins versus Pentair Water operating margins. In the
    third quarter of 2005, the Water Group’s operating margins
    crossed over and both the third and fourth quarter operating
    margins were higher than the same quarters in 2004. In the
    future, we intend to drive margins in the expanded Water Group
    toward a goal of 15 percent, while capturing growth
    opportunities.

•

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool/spa equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from March to July. The
    magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by effective
    use of the distribution channel by employing some advance sales
    programs (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly
    related to heavy flooding and droughts.

Outlook

In 2006, our operating objectives include the following:

•

Continue to use PIMS to drive the three key elements of our
    strategy: operating excellence, international expansion, and
    growth, both organic and acquired;

•

Continue the integration of the WICOR and Thermal acquisitions
    and realize identified synergistic opportunities;

•

Continue proactive talent management process building
    competencies in international management and other key
    functional areas;

•

Achieve significant organic sales growth (in excess of market
    growth), particularly in international markets; and

•

Continue to make strategic acquisitions to grow and expand our
    existing platforms in our Water and Technical Products segments.



Our ability to achieve our operating objectives will depend, to
    a certain extent, on factors outside our control. See “Risk
    Factors” under Part I of this report.

Water

The 36.3 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2005
    from 2004 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our July 31, 2004
    acquisition of WICOR and our February 23, 2005 acquisition
    of DEP;



•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases;

•

sales growth on a proforma basis (assuming we had acquired WICOR
    at the beginning of 2004 and excluding the recent Thermal
    acquisition and favorable foreign currency exchange) of
    approximately four percent for the year;

•

an increase in sales of pool and spa equipment due to market
    share gains, favorable weather conditions, and successful early
    buy programs;

•

growth in international markets; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The 47.4 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2004
    from 2003 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our July 31, 2004
    acquisition of WICOR and our December 31, 2003 acquisition
    of Everpure;

•

higher organic growth for pool and spa equipment by capturing a
    larger share of the increasing spend on the home environment,
    primarily through the expansion of our product offerings,
    including the introduction of several new innovative products
    and product systems;

•

strong sales of pumps for residential water systems and sump
    pumps, somewhat driven by North American weather patterns,
    combined with strong demand for commercial and engineered
    pumping systems;

•

significant growth in international markets;

•

an increase in the sales of water filtration products including
    residential and industrial tanks and valves in the U.S. and
    European markets, which was driven particularly in the first
    half of 2004 by rebounding economic conditions consistent with
    increased housing starts and the low interest rate environment;

•

favorable foreign currency effects; and

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases.

Technical
    Products

The 14.0 percent increase in Technical Products segment
    sales in 2005 from 2004 was primarily the result of:

•

Growth in new products including Advanced Telecommunications
    Computing Architecture (ATCA), slide rails for datacom
    applications and a new cabinet line targeted toward the telecom
    and electronic markets;

•

improved service and delivery resulting in increased sales
    volume in North America with strong sales in commercial and
    medical industry segments;

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases;

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our December 1, 2005
    acquisition of thermal management businesses from APW, Ltd;

•

higher sales in China; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The 22.7 percent increase in Technical Products segment
    sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

•

higher sales due to the addition of new distributors, new
    products, and higher demand from established industrial markets,
    as well as security, medical, networking, and commercial markets;

•

some recovery in North American telecom and datacom demand;



•

an increase in European sales volume due to new customers and
    improved business activity at large OEMs, particularly in the
    test and measurement, automation and control, and telecom
    markets, offset by a slowing European economy;

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases, principally for steel; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

favorable cost leverage from the combined larger company of
    Pentair and the former WICOR businesses.

These decreases are partially offset by:

•

adoption of SFAS 123R which requires us to record expense
    for the fair value of stock-based compensation;

•

investments made to support future growth; and

•

higher amortization of intangibles due to acquisitions and
    amortization of a tax strategy-based investment.

The 1.1 percentage point increase in SG&A expense as
    a percent of sales in 2004 from 2003 was primarily the result
    of:

•

increased selling expenses and management incentives due to
    strong sales growth in 2004;

•

increased amounts of sales incentives, including volume-based
    rebates, which are recorded as a reduction of net sales;

•

higher SG&A expense associated with our December 31,

•

a favorable benefit of $1.4 million related to R&D tax
    credits;

•

a favorable settlement of an IRS audit for the periods

1998-2001

resulting in a release of tax contingency reserves in the amount
    of $1.3 million;

•

a favorable adjustment of $1.0 million related to the
    filing of the 2004 Federal tax return; and

•

a benefit related to the deduction for qualified production
    activities.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

an anticipated unfavorable settlement of $3.2 million
    recorded for a routine tax examination of prior years in
    Germany; and

•

higher effective tax rate due to the non-deductibility of
    certain SFAS 123R expenses related to stock options.

The 3.0 percentage point increase in the tax rate in
    2004 from 2003 was primarily the result of:

•

increased operating income coupled with the relatively fixed
    nature of many of our tax savings programs;

•

the mix of our 2004 U.S. and foreign earnings; and

•

our July 31, 2004 acquisition of WICOR which results in a
    higher effective tax rate.

We expect our full year effective tax rate in 2006 to be
    36 percent. We will continue to pursue tax rate reduction
    opportunities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

Cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures,
    equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments, and dividend
    payments are generally funded from cash generated from
    operations, availability under existing committed revolving
    credit facilities, and in certain instances, public and private
    debt and equity offerings. In 2005, we invested
    $151 million in acquisitions, paid $53 million in
    dividends and repurchased $25 million of our stock; and
    increased our debt by only $17 million.

We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal
    demand in a number of markets within our Water segment. End-user
    demand for pool/spa equipment follows warm weather trends and is
    at seasonal highs from March to July. The magnitude of the sales
    spike is partially mitigated by effective use of the
    distribution channel by employing some advance sales programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns particularly
    related to heavy flooding and droughts.

Operating
    Activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $247.9 million in
    2005, or $16.2 million lower compared with the same period
    in 2004. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities
    is due to working capital increases related to increased sales
    volume, the rationalization of Water segment operations, and
    increases in various customer rebates. The increased days of
    sales in accounts receivable as of December 31, 2005
    compared to December 31, 2004 is the result of the
    differences in sales terms offered by the former WICOR business
    compared to the terms offered by our former Tools Group and the
    sale of approximately a $22.0 million interest in a pool of
    accounts receivable to a third-party financial institution in
    2004. The increased days inventory on hand as of
    December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 was
    driven by the increased inventory levels attributable to
    increased sourcing out of Asia, higher value of inventories due
    to rising raw material input costs, and inventory redundancies
    associated with the

ramp-up

of
    new facilities and the wind-down of old facilities. The working
    capital ratios as of December 31, 2005 versus
    December 31, 2004 have increased, primarily for the same
    reasons. In the future, we expect our working capital ratios to
    improve as we are able to capitalize on the anticipated success
    of our post-acquisition integration activities and PIMS
    initiatives.

Cash provided by operating activities was $264.1 million in
    2004, or $1.2 million higher compared with the same period
    in 2003. The increase in net cash provided by operating
    activities was primarily attributable to an increase in net
    income offset by higher levels of inventory due to inventory
    builds to support customers during product transfers and plant
    consolidation activities in Water. The WICOR acquisition has
    increased our working capital ratios, primarily inventory days,
    which will continue until our post-acquisition integration
    activities are farther along and our PIMS initiatives are better
    established.

In December 2004, we sold an approximate $22.0 million
    interest in a pool of accounts receivable to a third-party
    financial institution to mitigate the credit risk associated
    with the receivable balance of a large customer. In compliance
    with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets
    and Extinguishments of Liabilities

, sales of accounts
    receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable
    in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds are included
    in the cash flows from operating activities in the consolidated
    statement of cash flows. As the estimated present value of the
    receivables sold approximated the carrying amount, no gain or
    loss was recorded in 2004. The Accounts Receivable Purchase
    Agreement was not renewed in 2005.

Investing
    Activities

Capital expenditures in 2005, 2004, and 2003 were
    $62.5 million, $48.9 million (including
    $43.1 million for continuing operations) and
    $43.6 million (including $29.0 million for continuing
    operations), respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures
    for fiscal 2006 to be approximately $80 to $85 million,
    primarily for expansion of low cost country manufacturing
    facilities, implementation of a unified business systems
    infrastructure in Europe, selective increases in equipment
    capacity, new product development, and general maintenance
    capital.

Cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of
    $17.1 million in 2005 was primarily related to the sale of
    three facilities.

On December 1, 2005, we acquired McLean Thermal Management,
    Aspen Motion Technologies and Electronic Solutions businesses
    from APW for approximately $140.0 million, including a cash
    payment of



$138.9 million and transaction costs of $1.1 million.
    These businesses provide thermal management solutions and
    integration services to the telecommunications, data
    communications, medical and security markets as part of our
    Technical Products Group.

In the third quarter 2005, we paid $10.4 million in
    post-closing purchase price adjustments related to the October
    2004 sale of our former Tools Group to The Black &
    Decker Corporation.

In April 2005, we sold our interest in the stock of LN Holdings
    Corporation for cash consideration of $23.6 million,
    resulting in a pre-tax gain of $5.2 million and an after
    tax gain of $3.3 million. The terms of the sale agreement
    establish two escrow accounts totaling $14 million to be
    used for payment of any potential adjustments to the purchase
    price, transaction expenses, and indemnification for certain
    losses such as environmental claims. In December 2005, we
    received $0.2M from the escrow accounts which increased our gain
    from the sale. Any remaining escrow balances are to be
    distributed by April 2008 to the former shareholders in
    accordance with their ownership percentages. Any funds received
    from settlement of escrows in future periods will be accounted
    for as additional gain on the sale of this interest.

On February 23, 2005, we acquired certain assets of DEP, a
    privately held company, for $10.3 million, including a cash
    payment of $10.0 million, transaction costs of
    $0.2 million, plus debt assumed of $0.1 million. The
    DEP product line addresses the water and wastewater markets and
    is part of our Water Group.

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we
    completed the sale of our Tools Group to BDK for approximately
    $796.8 million in cash, including a $21.8 million
    interim net asset value increase, subject to post-closing
    adjustments.

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of
    all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR from Wisconsin
    Energy Corporation for $874.7 million, including a cash
    payment of $871.1 million, transaction costs of
    $11.2 million, and debt assumed of $21.6 million, less
    a favorable final purchase price adjustment of
    $14.0 million; and less cash acquired of
    $15.2 million. This includes an additional
    $0.4 million in transaction costs recorded in the first
    three quarters of 2005.

On April 5, 2004, we acquired all of the remaining stock of
    the Tools Group’s Asian joint venture for
    $21.8 million in cash, $6.4 million of which was paid
    following the sale of the Tools Group. The level of return on
    sales targets achieved in the second quarter of 2004 required a
    payment of $0.9 million, which was recorded as an increase
    to goodwill. The acquisition included cash acquired of
    $6.2 million and debt assumed of $9.0 million. The
    investment in the Tools Group’s Asian joint venture
    business was sold as part of the Tools Group to BDK.

In the second quarter of 2004, we paid $3.9 million in
    purchase price adjustments related to the December 31, 2003
    acquisition of Everpure. The adjustment primarily related to the
    final determination of closing date net assets.

In the first quarter of 2004, we paid $2.3 million for
    acquisition fees primarily related to the December 31, 2003
    acquisition of Everpure.

Financing
    Activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $43.8 million in
    2005 compared to $137.8 million in 2004. Financing
    activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving
    credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of
    business, dividend payments, share repurchases, and cash
    received from stock option exercises.

In March 2005, we amended and restated our multi-currency
    revolving Credit Facility, increasing the size of the facility
    from $500 million to $800 million with a term of five
    years. The interest rate on the loans under the
    $800 million Credit Facility is LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest
    rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit
    ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper



outstanding. As of December 31, 2005, we had
    $144.7 million of commercial paper outstanding that matured
    within 54 days. All of the commercial paper was classified
    as long-term as we have the intent and the ability to refinance
    such obligations on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility.
    Availability under our Credit Facility at December 31,
    2005, including outstanding commercial paper, was approximately
    $543.0 million.

Effective following the close of business on July 31, 2004,
    we completed the acquisition of WICOR. We funded the payment of
    the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR
    acquisition with the Bridge Facility and through additional
    borrowings available under our existing Credit Facility. The
    interest rate on the Bridge Facility and loans under the Credit
    Facility during the period of the Bridge Facility was LIBOR plus
    1.375%.

On October 4, 2004, we received approximately
    $796.8 million of proceeds from the sale of our Tools Group
    to BDK. As required under the terms of the Bridge Facility, we
    used the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and additional
    borrowings under the Credit Facility to pay off the Bridge
    Facility. Following payment of the Bridge Facility and based on
    our existing credit ratings, the interest rate on loans under
    the Credit Facility decreased to LIBOR plus 1.125%.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $25 million of
    uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had no borrowings
    as of December 31, 2005.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

Rating Agency

Long-Term Debt Rating

Current Rating Outlook

Standard & Poor’s

BBB

Stable

Moody’s

Baa3

Stable

We believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial
    outlook is currently not significant to our liquidity exposure
    or cost of debt. A credit rating is a current opinion of the
    creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
    financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations,
    or a specific financial program. The credit rating takes into
    consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or
    other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes
    into account the currency in which the obligation is
    denominated. On the other hand, the ratings outlook highlights
    the potential direction of a short or long-term rating. It
    focuses on identifiable events and short-term trends that cause
    ratings to be placed under observation by the respective Rating
    Agencies. A change in rating outlook does not mean a rating
    change is inevitable. Prior changes in our ratings outlook have
    had no immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost
    of debt.

We issue short-term commercial paper notes that are currently
    not rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.
    Even though our short-term commercial paper is unrated, we
    believe a downgrade in our long-term debt rating could have a
    negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated
    commercial paper.

We do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long-term
    debt by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
    would substantially affect our ability to access the long term
    debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions,
    the amount, timing and pricing of new borrowings could be
    adversely affected. If both of our long-term debt ratings were
    downgraded to below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the
    term debt capital markets would be reduced. In the event of a
    downgrade of our long-term debt rating, the cost of borrowing
    and fees payable under our Credit Facility and $35 million
    private placement fixed rate note could increase. While the
    Credit Facility has a pricing grid based in part on credit
    ratings, we do not have any agreements under which the
    obligations are accelerated in the event of a ratings downgrade.

As of December 31, 2005, our capital structure consisted of
    $752.6 million in total indebtedness and
    $1,555.6 million in shareholders’ equity. The ratio of

debt-to-total

capital at December 31, 2005 was 32.6 percent,
    compared with 33.7 percent at December 31, 2004. Our
    targeted

debt-to-total

capital ratio is 40 percent or less.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support
    working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest
    and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order
    to meet these cash



requirements, we intend to use available cash and internally
    generated funds and to borrow under our committed and
    uncommitted credit facilities.

We paid dividends in 2005 of $53.1 million, compared with
    $43.1 million in 2004 and $40.5 million in 2003. We
    anticipate continuing the practice of paying dividends on a
    quarterly basis.

In December 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the
    development of a program and process to repurchase shares of our
    common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25.0 million
    of our common stock annually. There is no expiration associated
    with the authorization granted. In 2005, we repurchased
    755,663 shares at $25 million under this plan. As of
    February 17, 2006, we had not repurchased any additional
    shares under this plan and, accordingly, we have the authority
    in 2006 to repurchase shares up to a maximum dollar limit of
    $25 million. In 2004 and 2003, respectively, we repurchased
    105,500 shares and 80,000 shares of our common stock
    under similar plans.

In addition to the summary of significant contractual
    obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on
    outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2005,
    variable interest rate debt was $357.0 million at a
    weighted average interest rate of 4.8%.

A purchase obligation is defined as an agreement to purchase
    goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on us
    that specifies all significant terms. The purchase obligation
    amounts do not represent our total anticipated future purchases,
    but represent those purchases for which we are contractually
    obligated. As of December 31, 2005, we did not have any
    purchase obligations requiring cash outflows of $1 million
    or greater per year.

We expect to make contributions in the range of $5 million
    to $10 million to our pension plans in 2006.

Other
    Financial Measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based
    upon operating, investing, and financing classifications
    included in the consolidated statements of cash flows, we also
    measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income.
    Free cash flow and conversion of net income are non-GAAP
    financial measures that we use to assess our cash flow
    performance and have a long-term goal to consistently generate
    free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100 percent
    conversion of net income. We believe free cash flow and
    conversion of net income are important measures of operating
    performance because they provide us and our investors a
    measurement of cash generated from operations that is available
    to pay dividends and repay debt. In addition, free cash flow and
    conversion of net income are used as a criterion to measure and
    pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow
    and conversion of net income may not be comparable to similarly
    titled measures reported by other companies. The following table
    is a reconciliation of free cash flow and a



calculation of the conversion of net income with cash flows from
    continuing and discontinued operating activities:

Off-Balance
    Sheet Arrangements

At December 31, 2005, we had no off-balance sheet financing
    arrangements.

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental
    clean-ups, in which our current or former business units have
    generally been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of
    these claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses over the last ten years and in certain
    cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper
    Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of
    the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the
    disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition
    of the Tools Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and
    potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We
    have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of
    the paper business and the ammunition business and have
    established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
    potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.
    We settled some of the claims in 2005 and 2003 and our recorded
    accruals were adequate.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, that relates to operations no
    longer carried out at that site. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this
    and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs
    will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When it is probable and it is
    possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability with
    respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our
    reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately
    $6.4 million and $9.4 million, respectively, measured
    on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental
    requirements will not change or become more stringent over time
    or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Stand-By
    Letters of Credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly for contracts
    and bids involving municipal pump products, we are required to
    commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit to secure our performance to third parties under
    self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2005, the outstanding value of these
    instruments totaled $38.8 million. As of December 31,
    2004, the outstanding value of these instruments



totaled $64.9 million, which included a $38.9 million
    stand-by letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal
    matter that was resolved in our favor during 2005, eliminating
    the bond requirement.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently
    adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be
    adopted in the future.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. Our
    significant accounting policies are more fully described in
    ITEM 8, Note 1 to our consolidated financial
    statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the
    application of significant judgment by management in selecting
    the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
    By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our
    historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our
    observance of trends in the industry, and information available
    from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an
    accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected would have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment
    of Goodwill

The fair value of each of our reporting units was estimated
    using a discounted cash flow approach. The test for impairment
    requires us to make several estimates about projected future
    cash flows and appropriate discount rates. If these estimates
    change, we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill. During
    the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed our annual impairment
    test of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment
    loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
    value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets
    held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that
    fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets.
    The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future
    cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
    consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from
    actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
    assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount
    rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels, and
    health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated
    annually and are disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 11 to the
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these assumptions
    will affect pension expense.



Discount
    Rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount
    rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to
    payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our
    U.S. plans of 5.75 percent in 2005 and 2004 and
    6.25 percent in 2003. The discount rates on our foreign
    plans ranged from 2.00% to 4.90% in 2005 versus a range of 2.00%
    to 5.25% in 2004. There are no known or anticipated changes in
    our discount rate assumption that will impact our pension
    expense in 2006.

Expected
    Rate of Return

The expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a
    long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical ten-year
    compounded annual return of 9.0 percent, with consideration
    given to forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations,
    input from external consultants and broader longer-term market
    indices. In 2005, the pension plan assets yielded a positive
    return of 4.2 percent, compared to positive returns of
    17.6 percent in 2004 and 24.8 percent in 2003. Our
    expected rate of return in 2005 equaled 8.5 percent, which
    remained unchanged from 2004 and 2003. In 2005 our expected
    return on plan assets was higher than our actual return on plan
    assets while in 2004 our expected return on plan assets was
    lower than our actual return on plans assets, the significant
    difference between our expected return on plan assets compared
    to our actual return on plan assets in 2005 and 2004 is
    primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the Pentair common
    stock during the respective years. There are no known or
    anticipated changes in our return assumption that will impact
    our pension expense in 2006.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension-Related
    Adjustments to Equity

In 2003, the financial markets recovered and resulted in a
    positive return on plan assets of 24.8 percent which
    eliminated $20.9 million of the 2002 $29.2 million
    charge to shareholders’ equity. The charge did not impact
    earnings. In 2004, our discount rate was lowered from
    6.25 percent to 5.75 percent. However, the change in
    the discount rate assumption was offset by higher than
    anticipated returns on assets and thus, did not significantly
    affect our shareholders’ equity. In 2005, the lower
    discount rate for our foreign plans and the lower return on plan
    assets resulted in an after-tax charge to equity of
    $5.7 million.

Net
    Periodic Benefit Cost

Total net periodic pension benefit cost was $20.0 million
    in 2005, $19.2 million in 2004, and $15.7 million in
    2003. Total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected to be
    approximately $24.5 million in 2006. The increasing trend
    in net periodic pension cost from 2003 forward is largely driven
    by the decrease in the discount rates and by actual returns on
    plan assets. The net periodic pension benefit cost for 2006 has
    been estimated assuming a discount rate of 5.75 percent and
    an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent.

Unrecognized
    Pension Losses

As of our December 31, 2005 measurement date, our pension
    plans have $93.4 million of cumulative unrecognized losses.
    To the extent the unrecognized loss exceeds 10% of the projected
    benefit obligation, it will be amortized into expense each year
    on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected
    future-working



lifetime of active participants (currently approximating
    12 years). The amount included in pension expense for loss
    amortization in 2005 was $2.8 million.

See ITEM 8, Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information regarding pension
    plans.

Item 7A

.  Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk

Market
    Risk

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We
    are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative
    financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of
    these risks. Counterparties to all derivative contracts are
    major financial institutions, thereby minimizing the risk of
    credit loss. All instruments are entered into for other than
    trading purposes. The major accounting policies and utilization
    of these instruments is described more fully in ITEM 8,
    Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of
    long-term debt (including current portion), interest rate swaps,
    and foreign exchange-forward contracts. The net market value of
    these financial instruments combined is referred to below as the
    net financial instrument position. As of December 31, 2005
    and December 31, 2004, the net financial instrument
    position was a liability of $769.0 million and
    $766.5 million, respectively.

Interest
    Rate Risk

Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2005, was primarily comprised of debt
    predominantly denominated in U.S. dollars (99%). This debt
    portfolio is composed of 52% fixed-rate debt and 48%
    variable-rate debt, considering the effects of our interest rate
    swaps. Taking into account the variable to fixed rate swap
    agreement we entered with an effective date of April 2006, our
    debt portfolio would be comprised of 66% fixed-rate debt and 34%
    variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different
    impacts on the fixed and variable-rate portions of our debt
    portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of
    the debt portfolio impacts the net financial instrument position
    but has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows. A change
    in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio
    impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact
    the net financial instrument position.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio,
    including the interest rate swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2005, a 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates would result in a $3.5 million
    increase or decrease in interest incurred.

Foreign
    Currency Risk

We are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in
    foreign exchange rates because some sales transactions, and the
    assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries, are
    denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the euro. We held
    immaterial positions in foreign exchange-forward contracts as of
    December 31, 2005. We do not expect the effect of foreign
    exchange rates to have a material impact on our operations.

    Statements and Supplementary Data

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“the
    Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining
    adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term
    is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts
    and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
    subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
    reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
    believes that, as of December 31, 2005, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    those criteria. Management has excluded from its assessment the
    internal control over financial reporting at the thermal
    management businesses acquired from APW, Ltd. on
    December 1, 2005 and whose financial statements reflect
    total assets and total revenues constituting five percent and
    one percent, respectively, of the related consolidated financial
    statement amounts of the Company as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2005.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation report
    on management’s assessment of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting for December 31, 2005.
    That attestation report is set forth immediately following the
    report of Deloitte & Touche LLP on the financial
    statements included herein.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of
    Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.

We have audited management’s assessment, included in the
    accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over
    Financial Reporting, that Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) maintained effective internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on
    criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission
    (the “COSO Framework”). As described in
    Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial
    Reporting, management excluded from their assessment the
    internal control over financial reporting at the thermal
    management businesses acquired from APW, Ltd. on
    December 1, 2005, and whose financial statements reflect
    total assets and revenues constituting 5 percent and
    1 percent, respectively, of the related consolidated
    financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended
    December 31, 2005. Accordingly, our audit did not include
    the internal control over financial reporting at the thermal
    management business. The Company’s management is
    responsible for maintaining effective internal control over
    financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness
    of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility
    is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an
    opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, evaluating
    management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design
    and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing
    such other procedures as we considered necessary in the
    circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable
    basis for our opinions.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s Board of Directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
    America (“generally accepted accounting principles”).
    A company’s internal control over financial reporting
    includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to
    the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
    accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions
    of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable
    assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
    preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally
    accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
    expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance
    with authorizations of management and directors of the company;
    and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention
    or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or
    disposition of the company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, management’s assessment that the Company
    maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
    as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material
    respects, based on the criteria established in the COSO
    Framework. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all
    material respects, effective internal control over financial
    reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the criteria
    established in the COSO Framework.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at ITEM 15 as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2005, of the Company, and our
    report dated February 27, 2006, expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those financial statements and financial statement
    schedule and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the
    Company’s change in 2005 in its method of accounting for
    stock-based compensation.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of
    Directors and Shareholders of Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, cash flows, and changes in
    shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the
    period ended December 31, 2005. Our audits also included
    the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at
    ITEM 15. These financial statements and financial statement
    schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s
    management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    financial statements and financial statement schedule based on
    our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2005, in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 13 to the consolidated
    financial statements, in 2005 the Company changed its method of
    accounting for stock-based compensation to conform to Statement
    of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123(R),

Share-Based Payment.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the
    criteria established in

Internal
    Control — Integrated Framework

issued by the
    Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission, and our report dated February 27, 2006
    expressed an unqualified opinion on management’s assessment
    of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting and an unqualified opinion on the
    effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting.

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal
    year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31. We report our interim
    quarterly periods on a

13-week

basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles
    of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and

non-U.S.,

that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own
    20 percent to 50 percent of the voting stock or have
    the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and
    financial policies of the investee are accounted for using the
    equity method of accounting and, as a result, our share of the
    earnings or losses of such equity affiliates is included in the
    statement of income. The cost method of accounting is used for
    investments in which Pentair has less than a 20 percent
    ownership interest and we do not have the ability to exercise
    significant influence. These investments are carried at cost and
    are adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value.

On May 17, 2004, our Board of Directors approved a

2-for-1

stock split in the form of a 100 percent stock dividend
    payable on June 8, 2004, to shareholders of record as of
    June 1, 2004. All share and per share information presented
    in this

Form 10-K

has been retroactively restated to reflect the effect of this
    stock split.

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we
    completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation. Our consolidated financial
    statements have been restated to reflect the Tools Group as a
    discontinued operation for all periods presented.

Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior
    years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the
    current year’s presentation.

Use of
    Estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (GAAP) requires us to make estimates
    and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
    consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Due to
    the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual
    results reported in future periods may be based upon amounts
    that could differ from those estimates. The critical accounting
    policies that require our most significant estimates and
    judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including
    goodwill; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in
    making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue
    Recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has
    been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery has occurred
    (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to
    the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold
    other than warranty obligations in the normal, ordinary course
    of business. In the event significant post-shipment obligations
    were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until
    substantially all obligations were satisfied.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (continued)

Sales
    Returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly with our
    customers. Revenue from a transaction is recognized only if our
    price is fixed and determinable at the date of sale; the
    customer has paid or is obligated to pay; the customer’s
    obligation would not be changed in the event of theft, physical
    destruction, or damage of the product; the customer has economic
    substance apart from our Company; we do not have significant
    obligations for future performance to directly bring about
    resale of the product by the customer; and the amount of returns
    can reasonably be estimated.

In general, our return policy allows for customer returns only
    upon our authorization. Goods returned must be product we
    continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of
    custom or modified goods are normally not allowed.

At the time of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect
    of returns. Estimated sales returns include consideration of
    historical sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical
    sales return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type
    of customer, and a projection of this experience into the future.

Pricing
    and Sales Incentives

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
    and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements,
    promotions, and other volume-based incentives at the later of
    the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered.
    Sales incentives given to our customers are recorded as a
    reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable
    benefit for the goods or services in exchange for the
    consideration and (2) we can reasonably estimate the fair
    value of the benefit received. The following represents a
    description of our pricing arrangements, promotions, and other
    volume-based incentives:

Pricing
    Arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers, and we
    record sales at the agreed upon net selling price. However, one
    of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a
    percentage of the original purchase price if they can
    demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM customer. At the time of
    sale, we estimate the anticipated refund to be paid based on
    historical experience and reduce sales for the probable cost of
    the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a
    reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as
    cooperative advertising. Under this cooperative advertising
    program, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of
    sales as an allowance to be used to advertise and promote our
    products. The customer is not required to provide evidence of
    the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the cost of this
    cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The cost of this
    program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-Based
    Incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front
    with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer
    achieves a specified cumulative level of sales. Under these
    incentive programs, at the time of sale, we reforecast the
    anticipated rebate to be paid based on forecasted sales levels.
    These forecasts are updated at least monthly, for each customer
    and sales are reduced for the anticipated cost of the rebate. If
    the forecasted sales for a customer changes, the accrual for
    rebates is adjusted to reflect the new amount of rebates
    expected to be earned by the customer.

There have been no material accounting revisions for
    revenue-recognition related estimates.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (continued)

Shipping
    and Handling Costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
    recorded in

net sales

in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by
    Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

cost of goods sold

in the accompanying consolidated
    statements of income.

Cash
    Equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities
    of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade
    Receivables and Concentration of Credit Risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts, reducing our
    receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from
    our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience,
    current trends, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic
    credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition.
    We generally do not require collateral. No customer receivable
    balances exceeded 10 percent of total net receivable
    balances as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively.

In December 2004, we entered into a one-year Accounts Receivable
    Purchase Agreement whereby designated customer accounts
    receivable may be sold without recourse to a third-party
    financial institution on a revolving basis. These receivables
    consisted of specific invoices that were assigned and subject to
    a filed security interest. We acted as the agent for the
    third-party, providing collections and claims services.
    Following the initial settlement period, we were required to
    transfer payments, make adjustment to invoice amounts and pay
    interest (at LIBOR plus 1.05%) on the assigned receivables to
    the third-party on a monthly basis. We were also required to
    maintain trade credit insurance on the sold receivables.
    Receivable sales could have occurred on the settlement date or
    as the third-party permitted, up to a maximum total outstanding
    amount of $30 million, with the ability to make additional
    sales as sold receivables are repaid. The Accounts Receivable
    Purchase Agreement was not renewed in 2005.

As of December 31, 2004, we had sold an approximate
    $22.0 million interest in our pool of accounts receivable
    to a third-party financial institution to mitigate the credit
    risk associated with the receivable balance of a large customer.
    In compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of
    Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities

, sales
    of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of accounts
    receivable in the consolidated balance sheets and the proceeds
    are included in the cash flows from operating activities in the
    consolidated statement of cash flows. As the estimated present
    value of the receivables sold approximated the carrying amount,
    no gain or loss was recorded in 2004.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market.
    Inventories of United States subsidiaries are generally
    determined by the

last-in,

first-out (LIFO) method. Inventories of foreign-based
    subsidiaries are determined by the

first-in,

first-out (FIFO) and moving average methods.

Property,
    Plant, And Equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at historical cost. We
    compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the
    following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold
    improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (continued)

Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or
    extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for
    repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When
    property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
    and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset, an impairment
    loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair
    value and carrying value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets
    held for sale are determined in a similar manner, except that
    fair values are reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets.
    The measurement of impairment requires us to estimate future
    cash flows and the fair value of long-lived assets.

Goodwill
    and Identifiable Intangible Assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis. During the
    fourth quarter of 2005, we completed our annual impairment test
    of goodwill and determined there was no impairment.

The primary identifiable intangible assets of Pentair include
    trade marks and trade names, brand names, patents, non-compete
    agreements, proprietary technology, and customer relationships.
    Under the provisions of SFAS No. 142, identifiable
    intangibles with finite lives are amortized and those
    identifiable intangibles with indefinite lives are not
    amortized. Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to
    amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or
    changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may
    not be recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject
    to amortization are tested for impairment annually, or more
    frequently if events warrant. The impairment test consists of a
    comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its
    carrying amount. During the fourth quarter of 2005, we completed
    our annual impairment test for those identifiable assets not
    subject to amortization and determined there was no impairment.

Cost
    and Equity Method Investments

We have investments that are accounted for at historical cost
    or, if we have significant influence over the investee, using
    the equity method. Pentair’s proportionate share of income
    or losses from investments accounted for under the equity method
    is recorded in the consolidated statements of income. We write
    down or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events
    or circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment
    that is

other-than-temporary.

This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the
    investees’ financial condition, and in certain cases the
    possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the
    investees’ historical results of operations and projected
    results and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees
    are significantly different from projections, we may incur
    future charges for the impairment of these investments.

Income
    Taxes

Pentair uses the asset and liability approach to account for
    income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
    liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax
    consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of
    assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using
    enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
    differences are expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax
    assets and liabilities of a



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (continued)

change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when
    the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a
    valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is
    more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred
    tax assets will not be realized. Changes in valuation allowances
    from period to period are included in our tax provision in the
    period of change.

Environmental

In accordance with

SOP 96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities

, we recognize
    environmental

clean-up

liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not
    subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental

clean-up

is
    estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based
    on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the
    estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the
    likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible
    parties (PRPs) will be able to fulfill their commitments at the
    sites where Pentair may be jointly and severally liable. The
    process of estimating environmental

clean-up

liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and
    extent of historical information and physical data relating to a
    contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty
    as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the
    outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs
    at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or
    regulations, advances in

clean-up

technologies, and additional information about the ultimate

clean-up

remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.
    Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in other
    liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance
    Subsidiary

We insure general and product liability, property, workers’
    compensation, and automobile liability risks through our wholly-
    owned captive insurance subsidiary. Reserves for policy claims
    are established based on actuarial projections of ultimate
    losses. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, reserves for
    policy claims were $45.8 million ($10.0 million
    included in

accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $35.8 million included in

other noncurrent
    liabilities

) and $38.8 million ($10.0 million
    included in

accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $28.8 million included in

other noncurrent
    liabilities

), respectively.

Stock-Based
    Compensation

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we adopted the fair value
    recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards No. (SFAS) 123R (revised 2004),

Share Based
    Payment,

which revised SFAS 123,

Accounting for
    Stock-Based Compensation

(SFAS 123) and supersedes
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25)

requiring
    us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our
    stock-based compensation awards. We adopted SFAS 123R
    effective January 1, 2005 using the modified retrospective
    transition method permitted by SFAS 123R. Under this
    transition method, restatement of only the interim financial
    statements in the year of adoption is permitted. We did not
    restate the financial information for 2004 and 2003 as a result
    of the adoption. In connection with the adoption, the expense in
    the proforma disclosures related to stock-based compensation was
    corrected for immaterial errors, resulting in no change to
    previously reported quarterly proforma earnings per share. The
    adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in the recognition
    of incremental pre-tax stock-based compensation expense of
    $16.4 million, a reduction in net income of
    $12.0 million, a reduction in basic and diluted earnings
    per share of $.12, a reduction in cash flows from operating
    activities of $8.7 million and an increase in cash flows
    from financing activities of $8.7 million. We additionally
    reclassified our unearned compensation on non-vested share
    awards of $7.9 million to additional paid in capital. The
    cumulative effect adjustment for forfeitures related to
    non-vested share awards was immaterial.

In accordance with SFAS 123R the estimated grant date fair
    value of each stock-based award is recognized in income on an
    accelerated basis over the requisite service period (generally
    the vesting period).



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (continued)

The estimated fair value of each Pentair option is calculated
    using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. From time to time,
    we have elected to modify the terms of the original grant. These
    modified grants in 2005 have been accounted for as a new award
    and measured using the fair value method under SFAS 123R,
    resulting in the inclusion of additional compensation expense in
    our consolidated statement of income. Non-vested share awards
    are recorded as compensation cost over the requisite service
    periods based on the market value on the date of grant.

Prior to January 1, 2005 we applied the recognition and
    measurement principles of APB 25 to our stock options and
    other stock-based compensation plans as permitted pursuant to
    SFAS 123.

In accordance with APB 25, cost for stock-based
    compensation is recognized in income based on the excess, if
    any, of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date
    of the award or other measurement date over the amount an
    employee must pay to acquire the stock. The exercise price for
    stock options granted to employees equals the fair market value
    of Pentair’s common stock at the date of grant, thereby
    resulting in no recognition of compensation expense by Pentair.
    However, from time to time, we have elected to modify the terms
    of the original grant. Those modified grants have been accounted
    for as a new award and

measured using the intrinsic value method under APB 25,
    resulting in the inclusion of compensation expense in our
    consolidated statement of income. Non-vested share awards are
    recorded as compensation cost over the requisite service periods
    based on the market value on the date of grant. Unearned
    compensation cost on non-vested share awards was shown as a
    reduction to shareholders’ equity.

Earnings
    Per Common Share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
    by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding,
    including the dilutive effects of stock options and non-vested
    shares. Unless otherwise noted, references are to diluted
    earnings per share.

Derivative
    Financial Instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other
    contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our
    balance sheet. If the derivative is designated as a fair-value
    hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and the
    hedged item are recognized in earnings. If the derivative is
    designated and is effective as a cash-flow hedge, changes in the
    fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive
    income (OCI) and are recognized in the consolidated statements
    of income when the hedged item affects earnings. If the
    underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge
    becomes ineffective, all changes in fair value of the related
    derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current
    earnings. For a derivative that is not designated as or does not
    qualify as a hedge, changes in fair value are reported in
    earnings immediately.

We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
    interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of
    ongoing business operations. All hedging instruments are
    designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS 133, as amended. We do not hold or issue
    derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative
    purposes. All other contracts that contain provisions meeting
    the definition of a derivative also meet the requirements of,
    and have been designated as, normal purchases or sales. Our
    policy is not to enter into contracts with terms that cannot be
    designated as normal purchases or sales.

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the
    United States are measured using the local currency as the
    functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the
    balance sheet date. The resultant translation adjustments are
    included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate
    component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items
    are translated at average monthly rates of exchange.

New
    Accounting Standards to be Adopted in the Future

In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (FASB) issued SFAS 153,

Exchanges of Nonmonetary
    Assets — An Amendment of APB Opinion No. 29,
    Accounting for Nonmonetary
    Transactions.

SFAS 153 eliminates the
    exception from fair value measurement for nonmonetary exchanges
    of similar productive assets in paragraph 21(b) of APB
    Opinion No. 29,

Accounting for Nonmonetary
    Transactions

, and replaces it with an exception for
    exchanges that do not have commercial substance. SFAS 153
    specifies that a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance
    if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change
    significantly as a result of the exchange. SFAS 153 is
    effective for the fiscal periods beginning after June 15,
    2005 and is required to be adopted by us on January 1,
    2006. The adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a
    material impact on our consolidated financial position, results
    of operations or cash flow.

In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151,

Inventory Costs — An Amendment of ARB
    No. 43, Chapter 4

. SFAS 151 amends the
    guidance in ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, “Inventory
    Pricing,” to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of
    idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted
    material (spoilage). Among other provisions, the new rule
    requires that items such as idle facility expense, excessive
    spoilage, double freight, and rehandling costs be recognized as
    current-period charges regardless of whether they meet the
    criterion of “so abnormal” as stated in ARB
    No. 43. Additionally, SFAS 151 requires that the
    allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of
    conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production
    facilities. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after June 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted
    by us on January 1, 2006. We are currently evaluating the
    effect that the adoption of SFAS 151 will have on our
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition but
    do not expect SFAS 151 to have a material impact.

In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached a
    consensus on Issue

No. 03-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.”

EITF 03-1

provides guidance on

other-than-temporary

impairment models for marketable debt and equity securities
    accounted for under SFAS 115 and non-marketable equity
    securities accounted for under the cost method. The EITF
    developed a basic three-step model to evaluate whether an
    investment is

other-than-temporarily

impaired. In November 2005, the FASB approved the issuance of
    FASB Staff Position

FAS No. 115-1

and

FAS 124-1,

“The Meaning of

Other-Than-Temporary

Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments.” The
    FSP addresses when an investment is considered impaired, whether
    the impairment is

other-than-temporary

and the measurement of an impairment loss. The FSP also includes
    accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an

other-than-temporary

impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized
    losses that have not been recognized as

other-than-temporary.

The FSP is effective for reporting periods beginning after
    December 15, 2005 and is required to be adopted by us on
    January 1, 2006. The adoption of this accounting principle
    is not expected to have a significant impact on our financial
    position or results of operations.

Acquisitions

On December 1, 2005, we acquired McLean Thermal Management,
    Aspen Motion Technologies, and Electronic Solutions businesses
    from APW, Ltd. (collectively, “Thermal”) for
    $140.0 million, including a cash payment of
    $138.9 million and transaction costs of $1.1 million.
    These businesses provide thermal management solutions and
    integration services to the telecommunications, data
    communications, medical, and security

markets as part of our Technical Products Group. Goodwill
    recorded as part of the initial purchase price allocation was
    $93.7 million, all of which is tax deductible. Preliminary
    estimates of identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of
    the acquisition were $18.9 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles of $9.8 million with a weighted
    average amortization period of 10.0 years. We continue to
    evaluate the purchase price allocation for the Thermal
    acquisition, including intangible assets, contingent
    liabilities, plant rationalization costs, and property, plant
    and equipment. We expect to revise the purchase price allocation
    as better information becomes available in 2006.

On February 23, 2005, we acquired certain assets of Delta
    Environmental Products, Inc. and affiliates (collectively,
    “DEP”), a privately-held company, for
    $10.3 million, including a cash payment of
    $10.0 million, transaction costs of $0.2 million, and
    debt assumed of $0.1 million. The DEP product line
    addressees the water and wastewater markets as part of our Water
    Group. Goodwill recorded as part of the initial purchase price
    allocation was $9.3 million, all of which is tax deductible.

Effective July 31, 2004, we completed the acquisition of
    all of the shares of capital stock of WICOR, Inc.
    (“WICOR”) from Wisconsin Energy Corporation
    (“WEC”) for $874.7 million, including a cash
    payment of $871.1 million, transaction costs of
    $11.2 million, and debt assumed of $21.6 million, less
    a favorable final purchase price adjustment of
    $14.0 million, and cash acquired of $15.2 million.
    This includes an additional $0.4 million of transaction
    costs recorded in the first three quarters of 2005. WICOR
    manufactures water system, filtration, and pool equipment
    products primarily under the
    STA-RITE

®

,
    SHURflo

®

,
    and
    Hypro

®

brands. We funded the payment of the purchase price and related
    fees and expenses of the WICOR acquisition with an $850 million
    committed line of credit (the “Bridge Facility”) and
    through additional borrowings available under our existing
    credit facility.

Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the
    acquisition were $181.5 million, including
    $102.0 million of definite-lived intangible assets,
    including patented and proprietary technology of
    $39.6 million with a weighted average amortization period
    of 11.6 years and customer relationships of
    $62.4 million with a weighted average amortization period
    of 18.0 years. We ascribed useful lives to patented and
    proprietary technology based on an analysis of the legal and
    contractual provisions. In addition, we ascribed a useful life
    of 18.0 years to customer relationships based on an
    analysis of customer attrition rates, the stability of product
    technology, and the value of proven customer service in
    retaining long standing customers. Due to a relatively flat
    forecasted attrition pattern, we will amortize the customer
    relationship balance on a straight-line basis over its estimated
    useful life.

Goodwill recorded as part of the final purchase price allocation
    was adjusted to $612.4 million, of which $70.6 million
    is tax deductible.

Discontinued
    Operations/Divestitures

Effective after the close of business October 2, 2004, we
    completed the sale of our former Tools Group to The
    Black & Decker Corporation (“BDK”) for
    approximately $796.8 million in cash, including a
    $21.8 million interim net asset value increase, subject to
    post-closing adjustments. We used the proceeds from the Tools
    Group sale and borrowings under our credit facility to repay, on
    October 4, 2004, the $850 million Bridge Facility used
    to acquire WICOR. We retained certain insurance liabilities,
    employee compensation and benefit liabilities, environmental
    liabilities, pension obligations, and post-retirement
    obligations of the Tools Group. In the fourth quarter of 2004,
    we recorded a loss on the disposal of the Tools Group of
    $6.0 million, net of a tax provision of $9.0 million.
    In July of 2005, we paid $10.4 million to BDK related to
    purchase price adjustments. We currently have an outstanding
    dispute over the net asset value of the Tools Group and may be
    required to repay some portion of the proceeds to BDK. We
    believe our accrual at December 31, 2005 is an adequate
    reserve amount for any potential liability. We expect resolution
    of this matter in the first quarter of 2006.

In 2001, we completed the sale of our Service Equipment
    businesses (Century Mfg. Co./Lincoln Automotive Company) to
    Clore Automotive, LLC for total consideration of
    $18.2 million and we completed the sale of Lincoln
    Industrial to affiliates of The Jordan Company LLC (Jordan),
    other investors, and members of management of Lincoln Industrial
    for total consideration of $78.4 million, including the
    retention of a preferred stock interest. In January 2003, we
    paid $2.4 million for a final adjustment to the selling
    price related to the disposition of Lincoln Industrial, which
    was offset by a previously established reserve. In the fourth
    quarter of 2003, we reported an additional loss from
    discontinued operations of $2.9 million primarily due to a
    reduction in estimated proceeds related to exiting two remaining
    facilities.

Includes discontinued operations through the date of
    divestiture, October 2, 2004.

During 2005 we recorded an additional loss on the disposal of
    discontinued operations of $4.2 million. The additional
    loss relates to increased reserve requirements for product
    recalls and contingent purchase price adjustments associated
    with the sale of our former Tools Group. We recorded a
    $4.2 million benefit in our income tax provision related to
    discontinued operations. The effective tax rate in 2005 for
    discontinued operations differs from the statutory rate due
    primarily to research and development tax credits and permanent
    book/tax differences.

During 2004 and 2003 our income tax provision related to
    discontinued operations was $34.0 million and
    $27.1 million, respectively. The effective tax rate of the
    discontinued operations for 2004 and 2003 differs from the
    statutory rate due primarily to state and foreign taxes. The tax
    provision resulting from the Tools Group sale transaction was
    $9.0 million. This amount, reflected in the
    $34.0 million amount above, differs from the statutory rate
    due primarily to state and foreign taxes which were impacted by
    the form of the transaction and the geographic locations of the
    assets that were sold.

    evaluation of the purchase price allocation for the WICOR
    acquisition, the adjustments primarily related to contingent
    liabilities, reserves for plant rationalizations, and deferred
    income taxes. During the fourth quarter of 2005 we made an
    adjustment to reverse a pre-acquisition tax contingency reserve
    related to the ESSEF acquisition.

Intangible asset amortization expense in 2005, 2004, and 2003
    was $11.7 million, $7.5 million, and
    $1.5 million, respectively. The increase in amortization
    expense between 2005 and 2004 was primarily the result of the
    WICOR acquisition. In the third quarter of 2004, we recorded
    $102.0 million of finite-lived intangible assets, including
    patented and proprietary technology of $39.6 million with a
    weighted average amortization period of 11.6 years and
    customer relationships of $62.4 million with a weighted

Cost
    Method Investments

As part of the sale of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we received
    37,500 shares of 5% Series C Junior Convertible
    Redeemable Preferred Stock convertible into a 15 percent
    equity interest in the new organization — LN
    Holdings Corporation. During the second quarter of 2005 we sold
    our interest in the stock LN Holdings Corporation for cash
    consideration of $23.6 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain
    of $5.2 million or an after-tax gain of $3.5 million.
    The terms of the sale agreement establish two escrow accounts
    totaling $14 million. We received payments from an escrow
    of $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2005,
    increasing our gain. Any remaining escrow balances are to be
    distributed by April 2008 to former shareholders in accordance
    with their ownership percentages. Any funds received from
    settlement of escrows in future periods will be accounted for as
    additional gain on sale of this interest. The preferred stock
    was recorded at $18.4 million in other assets as
    December 31, 2004, which represented the estimated fair
    value of that investment at the time of the Lincoln Industrial
    sale.

Equity
    Method Investments

We have a 50 percent investment in FARADYNE Motors LLC at
    December 31, 2005, a joint venture with ITT Water
    Technologies, Inc. that began design, development, and
    manufacturing of submersible pump motors in 2005. We do not
    consolidate the investment in our financial statements as we do
    not have a controlling interest over the investment. The
    investment at December 31, 2005 was $1.2 million,
    which is net of our proportionate share of losses during 2005 of
    $1.2 million. Our proportionate share of earnings or losses
    is recorded on a one-month lag.

In 2005, the minimum pension liability adjustment increased
    compared to the prior year despite no change in the discount
    rate for the U.S. plans. The increase is attributable to
    lower than expected pension plan performance as well as a
    reduction in the discount rates associated with our foreign
    defined benefit plans. In 2004, the minimum pension liability
    remained relatively consistent compared to prior year despite
    the 50 basis point decrease in the discount rate to 5.75%
    as of December 31, 2004, as it was offset by our pension
    plan asset performance. The net foreign currency translation
    loss in 2005 of $28.4 million was the result of the
    weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. The net
    foreign currency gain in 2004 of $25.4 million, was
    primarily the result of a stronger U.S. dollar against the
    Euro and Canadian dollar currencies. Changes in the market value
    of derivative financial instruments was impacted primarily by
    the maturities of derivatives and changing interest rates.
    Fluctuations in the value of hedging instruments are generally
    offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying exposures
    being hedged.

In July 2005, we amended our floating rate private placement
    note purchase agreement, decreasing the interest rate on the
    notes by .550% to LIBOR plus .600%. Additionally, the amendment
    extended the prepayment provisions of the note purchase
    agreement permitting prepayment on or after July 25, 2006.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. As of
    December 31, 2005, we had $144.7 million of commercial
    paper outstanding that matured within 54 days. All of the
    commercial paper was classified as long-term as we have the
    intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a
    long-term basis under the Credit Facility. Availability under
    our Credit Facility at December 31, 2005, including
    outstanding commercial paper, was approximately
    $543.0 million.

Effective following the close of business on July 31, 2004,
    we completed the acquisition of WICOR. We funded the payment of
    the purchase price and related fees and expenses of the WICOR
    acquisition with an $850 million Bridge Facility and
    through additional borrowings available under our existing
    Credit Facility. The interest rate on the Bridge Facility and
    loans under the Credit Facility during the period of the Bridge
    Facility was LIBOR plus 1.375%.

On October 4, 2004, we received approximately
    $796.8 million of proceeds from the sale of our Tools Group
    to BDK. As required under the terms of the Bridge Facility, we
    used the proceeds from the Tools Group sale and additional
    borrowings under the Credit Facility to pay off the Bridge
    Facility. Following payment of the Bridge Facility and based on
    our existing credit ratings, the interest rate on loans under
    the Credit Facility decreased to LIBOR plus 1.125%.

We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of
    December 31, 2005.

9.  Derivative
    and Financial Instruments

Cash-Flow
    Hedges

We have a $100 million interest rate swap agreement with
    several major financial institutions, expiring July 2013, to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for fixed
    rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying
    principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures.
    The swap becomes effective in April 2006, at the fixed interest
    rate of 4.68% plus .60% interest rate spread over LIBOR,
    resulting in a fixed interest rate of 5.28%. The fair value of
    the swap was an asset of $0.8 million at December 31,
    2005. At December 31, 2004 we had a variable to fixed
    interest rate swap agreement outstanding with an aggregate
    notional amount of $20.0 million, with a fixed interest
    rate of 6.31 percent, this agreement expired in June 2005.
    The fair value of this swap was a liability of $0.4 million
    at December 31, 2004.

The variable to fixed interest rate swap is designated as and is
    effective as a cash-flow hedge. The fair value of this swap is
    recorded on the balance sheet, with changes in fair values
    included in other comprehensive income (OCI). Derivative gains
    and losses included in OCI are reclassified into earnings at the
    time the related interest expense is recognized or the
    settlement of the related commitment occurs. We estimate the net
    derivative gains or losses that will be reclassified into
    earnings during 2006 will not be material. No hedging
    relationships were de-designated during 2005.

Fair
    Value Hedge

During 2002, we entered into a interest rate swap agreement to
    effectively convert $100 million of senior notes for the
    term of the notes (maturing October 2009) from a
    7.85 percent fixed annual rate to a floating annual rate
    equal to the six-month LIBOR rate plus 3.69 percent. The
    fair value of the swap was a liability of $0.5 million at
    December 31, 2004. This swap agreement was designated and
    accounted for as a fair value hedge. Since this swap qualified
    for the short-cut method under SFAS No. 133, changes
    in the fair value of the swap (included in

other long-term
    liabilities

in the consolidated balance sheets) are offset
    by changes in the fair value of the designated debt being
    hedged. Consequently, there was no impact on net income or
    shareholders’ equity. During 2005, we terminated this swap
    agreement resulting in a nominal amount of proceeds.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of
    these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets”
    (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
    in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities”
    (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the
    tax impact has not yet been recorded in the consolidated
    statements of income).

During 2005, our effective tax rate was impacted by a benefit of
    $1.4 million related to R&D tax credits, a settlement
    of an IRS audit resulting in a release of tax contingency
    reserves of $1.3 million, a favorable adjustment related to
    the filing of our 2004 Federal tax return of $1.0 million.
    Our effective tax rate was also impacted favorably by tax
    deductions for profits associated with qualified domestic
    production activities. These favorable items are offset by a
    $3.2 million anticipated unfavorable settlement for a
    routine German tax examination related to prior years as well as
    the tax impact of the adoption of SFAS 123R.

During the fourth quarter of 2004, we repatriated approximately
    $75.0 million in extraordinary dividends, as defined in the
    American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the “Jobs Act”),
    consisting primarily of foreign proceeds resulting from the sale
    of the Tools Group. We elected to apply the provisions of
    Section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code, enacted as part
    of the Jobs Act, to the repatriated extraordinary dividends and
    therefore, were eligible to claim an eighty-five percent
    dividends received deduction for income tax purposes on the
    eligible amounts. The net tax cost of the repatriation of the
    extraordinary dividends, recorded in discontinued operations,
    was approximately $4.0 million.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our
    intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to
    repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.
    As of December 31, 2005, approximately $97.0 million
    of unremitted earnings attributable to international
    subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely invested. We
    believe that any U.S. tax on repatriated earnings would be
    substantially offset by U.S. foreign tax credits.

The determination of annual income tax expense takes into
    consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for
    open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has examined
    our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2001 with no
    material adjustments and is currently auditing 2002 and 2003. In
    connection with the completion of the 1998 to 2001 Federal
    income tax audit, we adjusted certain income tax reserves
    established related to the periods under examination and
    recorded a benefit of $1.3 million to our first quarter
    2005 income statement. We do not expect any material impact on
    earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to
    open tax years; however, actual settlements may differ from
    amounts accrued.

Non-U.S. tax

losses of $5.7 million and $5.3 million were available
    for carryforward at December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively. A valuation allowance of $1.5 million and
    $1.6 million exists for deferred income tax benefits
    related to the loss carryforwards available that may not be
    realized as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We
    believe that sufficient taxable income will be generated in the
    respective countries to allow us to fully recover the remainder
    of the tax losses. A majority of our

non-U.S. tax

losses can be carried forward indefinitely. The remaining

non-U.S. tax

losses will begin to expire in 2007.

Benefit
    Plans

Pension
    and Post-Retirement Benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based
    principally on an employee’s years of service

and/or

compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also
    provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance
    benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life
    insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a
    December 31 measurement date each year.

The acquisition of WICOR in 2004 increased unfunded pension
    liabilities by approximately $23.7 million and increased
    post-retirement liabilities by approximately $32.1 million
    at December 31, 2004. Corresponding liabilities equal to
    the unfunded liabilities were recorded on WICOR’s opening
    balance sheet.

The sale of our Tools Group in 2004 decreased post-retirement
    liabilities at December 31, 2004 by approximately
    $4.8 million. In 2005 we completed the transfer of pension
    plan assets and related plan liabilities, resulting in a
    reduction in plan liabilities that was $3.8 million greater
    than the amount of plan assets transferred.

In 2004, under the requirements of SFAS No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
    Benefits

, we recognized a curtailment expense and special
    termination benefits totaling approximately $1.8 million
    due to the divestiture of the Tools Group.

On December 8, 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug
    Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Medicare Act) was
    signed into law. The Act expands Medicare to include coverage
    for prescription drugs. On May 19, 2004, the FASB issued
    FSP

No. 106-2,

“Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the
    Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of
    2003”, which requires current recognition of the federal
    subsidy that employers may receive for providing drug coverage
    to retirees. FSP

No. 106-2

was effective for the Company July 4, 2004. The amount of
    subsidies we expect to receive is not material relative to our
    accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation.

Discount
    Rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount
    rate was determined by matching our expected benefit payments to
    payments from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate of 5.75 percent
    in 2005 and 2004 and 6.25 percent in 2003. The discount
    rates on our foreign plans ranged from 2.00% to 4.90% in 2005
    versus a range of 2.00% to 5.25% in 2004. There are no known or
    anticipated changes in our discount rate assumptions that will
    impact our pension expense in 2006.

Expected
    Rate of Return

The expected rate of return on plan assets is designed to be a
    long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical ten-year
    compounded annual return of 9.0 percent, with consideration
    given to forecasted economic conditions, our asset allocations,
    input from external consultants and broader longer-term market
    indices. In 2005, the pension plan assets yielded a positive
    return of 4.2 percent, compared to a positive return of
    17.6 percent in 2004. Our expected rate of return in 2005
    equaled 8.5 percent, which remained unchanged from 2004. In
    2005 our expected return on plan assets was higher than our
    actual return on plan assets while in 2004 our expected return
    on plan assets was lower than our actual return on plans assets,
    the significant difference between our expected return on plan
    assets compared to our actual return on plan assets in 2005 and
    2004 is primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the
    Pentair common stock price during the respective years. There
    are no known or anticipated changes in our return assumption
    that will impact our pension expense in 2006.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (continued)

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Pension-Related
    Adjustments to Equity

In 2003, the financial markets recovered and resulted in a
    positive return on plan assets of 24.8 percent which
    eliminated $20.9 million of the 2002 $29.2 million
    charge to shareholders’ equity. The charge did not impact
    earnings. In 2004, our discount rate was lowered from
    6.25 percent to 5.75 percent. However, the change in
    the discount rate assumption was offset by higher than
    anticipated returns on assets and thus, did not significantly
    affect our shareholders’ equity. In 2005, our discount rate
    remained consistent with 2004; however, a lower return on plan
    assets as well as a decrease in the discount rates for our
    foreign plans resulted in an after-tax charge to equity of
    $5.7 million.

Net
    Periodic Benefit Cost

Total net periodic pension benefit cost was $20.0 million
    in 2005, $19.2 million in 2004, and $15.7 million in
    2003. Total net periodic pension benefit cost is expected to be
    approximately $24.5 million in 2006. The increasing trend
    in net periodic pension cost from 2003 forward is largely driven
    by the decrease in the discount rate in 2005 and by actual
    returns on plan assets. The net periodic pension benefit cost
    for 2006 has been estimated assuming a discount rate of
    5.75 percent and an expected return on plan assets of
    8.5 percent.

Unrecognized
    Pension Losses

As of our December 31, 2005 measurement date, our pension
    plans have $93.4 million of cumulative unrecognized losses.
    To the extent the unrecognized loss exceeds 10% of the projected
    benefit obligation, it will be amortized into expense each year
    on a straight-line basis over the remaining expected
    future-working lifetime of active participants (currently
    approximating 12 years). The amount included in pension
    expense for loss amortization in 2005 was $2.8 million.

The assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31
    are as follows:

Plan
    Assets

Objective

The primary objective of our pension plans is to meet
    commitments to our employees at a reasonable cost to the
    company. This is primarily accomplished through growth of
    capital and safety of the funds invested. The plans will
    therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital
    over inflation through appreciation of securities held and
    through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and
    interest income.

Actual asset allocation as of December 31, 2005 and 2004,
    respectively.

We regularly review our asset allocation and periodically
    rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when
    considered appropriate. From time to time, we may be outside our
    targeted ranges by amounts we deem acceptable.

At December 31, 2004, our cash balance was higher than
    normal due to the liquidation of the WICOR pension assets held
    in a separate trust. Those funds were transferred to our pension
    master trust and subsequent to December 31, 2004, a portion
    was reinvested in accordance with our targeted asset
    allocations. We transferred most of the remaining cash balance
    to BDK in conjunction with our transfer of certain pension
    benefit obligations related to the divested Tools Group. We do
    require a cash balance to be available to fund monthly benefit
    payments and administrative fees.

Equity securities include Pentair common stock in the amount of
    $32.6 million and $41.1 million at December 31,
    2005 and 2004, respectively.

Cash
    Flows

Contributions

In 2005, pension contributions totaled $4.1 million,
    including $0.3 million of contributions to domestic defined
    benefit pension plans. In 2004, pension contributions totaled
    $7.2 million, including $2.7 million of contributions
    to domestic defined benefit pension plans. The contributions in
    2005 and 2004 equaled or exceeded the minimum funding
    requirement. Our 2006 pension contributions are expected to be
    in the range of $5 million to $10 million.

Savings
    Plan

We have a 401(k) plan (the plan) with an employee stock
    ownership (ESOP) bonus component, which covers certain union and
    nearly all non-union U.S. employees who meet certain age
    requirements. Under the plan, eligible U.S. employees may
    voluntarily contribute a percentage of their eligible
    compensation. Matching contributions are made in cash to
    employees who meet certain eligibility and service requirements.
    Our matching contribution is fixed at 50 percent of
    eligible employee contributions, and is limited to
    5 percent of employee compensation contributed by employees.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet
    certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP
    contribution equal to 1.5 percent of annual eligible
    compensation.

Our combined expense for the plan and ESOP were approximately
    $8.8 million, $10.7 million, and $7.3 million, in
    2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Authorized
    Shares

We may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our
    Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those
    shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board
    of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock of up to
    2.5 million shares, Series A Junior Participating
    Preferred Stock, par value $0.10 per share. No shares of
    preferred stock were issued or outstanding as of
    December 31, 2005 or December 31, 2004.

Purchase
    Rights

On December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock.
    The dividend was payable upon the close of business on
    January 28, 2005 to the shareholders of record upon the
    close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right entitles
    the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share
    of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a
    price of $240.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless
    certain change in control events occur, such as a person
    acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership
    of 15 percent or more of our outstanding common stock. The
    description and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights
    Agreement, dated December 10, 2004. The Rights will expire
    on January 28, 2015, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed
    or exchanged in accordance with the terms of the Rights
    Agreement. On January 28, 2005, the common share purchase
    rights issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated
    July 31, 1995 were redeemed in their entirety for an amount
    equal to $0.0025 per right.

Share
    Repurchases

In December 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the
    development of a program and process to repurchase shares of our
    common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of $25.0 million
    annually. There is no expiration associated with the
    authorization granted. In 2005, we repurchased
    755,663 shares for $25.0 million under this plan. We
    have the authority in 2006 to repurchase shares up to a maximum
    dollar limit of $25.0 million. As of February 17, 2006
    we had not repurchased any shares under this plan. In 2004 and
    2003, respectively, we repurchased 105,500 shares and
    80,000 shares of our common stock under similar plans.

Stock
    Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense from continuing
    operations in 2005, 2004, and 2003 was $24.2 million,
    $6.3 million, and $4.0 million, respectively. The
    increase in 2005 is attributable to the adoption of
    SFAS 123R in the fourth quarter of 2005 using the modified
    retrospective transition method and restating interim periods in
    2005. The adoption of SFAS 123R in 2005 resulted in the
    recognition of incremental pre-tax stock-based compensation of
    $16.4 million, a reduction in net income of
    $12.0 million, a reduction in basic and diluted earnings
    per share of $.12, a reduction in cash flows from operating
    activities of $8.7 million and an increase in cash flows
    from financing activities of $8.7 million. We additionally
    reclassified our unearned compensation on non-vested share
    awards of $7.9 million to additional paid in capital. The
    cumulative effect adjustment for forfeitures related to
    non-vested share awards was immaterial.

Omnibus
    Stock Incentive Plan

In April 2004, the Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended and
    Restated (the Plan) was approved by shareholders. The Plan
    authorizes the issuance of additional shares of our common stock
    and extends through April 2014. The Plan allows for the granting
    of:

•

nonqualified stock options;

•

incentive stock options;

•

non-vested shares;

•

rights to non-vested shares;

•

incentive compensation units (ICUs);

•

stock appreciation rights;

•

performance shares; and

•

performance units.

The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee (the
    Committee), which is made up of independent members of our Board
    of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards under the
    Plan are managerial, administrative, or other key employees who
    are in a position to make a material contribution to the
    continued profitable growth and long-term success of Pentair.
    The Committee has the authority to select the recipients of
    awards, determine the type and size of awards, establish certain
    terms and conditions of award grants, and take certain other
    actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan provides that no
    more than 20 percent of the total shares available for
    issuance under the Plan may be used to make awards other than
    stock options and limits the Committee’s authority to
    reprice awards or to cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

Non-Qualified
    and Incentive Stock Options

Under the Plan we may grant stock options to any eligible
    employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally
    vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and
    expire ten years after the grant date. Option grants typically
    have a reload feature when shares are retired to pay the
    exercise price, allowing individuals to receive additional
    options upon exercise equal to the number of shares retired.

Non-Vested
    Shares, Rights to Non-Vested Shares and ICUs

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded non-vested shares
    or rights to non-vested shares (awards) of our common stock.
    Share awards generally vest from two to five years after
    issuance, subject to continuous employment and certain other
    conditions. Non-vested share awards are valued at market value
    on the date of grant and are expensed over the vesting period.
    Annual expense for the value of non-vested shares and rights to
    non-vested shares was $7.0 million in 2005,
    $6.3 million in 2004, and $3.7 million in 2003. ICUs
    are cash incentives granted to employees. Annual expense for
    ICUs was $0.0 million in 2005, $0.3 million in 2004,
    and $0.9 million in 2003.

Stock
    Appreciation Rights, Performance Shares, and Performance
    Units

Under the Plan, the compensation committee is permitted to issue
    these awards; however, there have been no issuances of these
    awards.

Nonqualified stock options are granted to outside directors

    over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and expire
    ten years after the grant date. The Directors Plan extends to
    January 2008.

    Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following
    business segments:

•

Water

— manufactures and markets
    essential products and systems used in the movement, treatment,
    storage and enjoyment of water. Water segment products include
    water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification
    components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and
    pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Technical Products

— formerly
    referred to as Enclosures, designs, manufactures, and markets
    standard, modified and custom enclosures that house and protect
    sensitive controls, components; thermal management products; and
    accessories. Applications served include industrial machinery,
    data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and
    measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general
    electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures,
    cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal
    management systems.

•

Other

— is primarily composed of
    unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance
    subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations,
    and intercompany eliminations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and
    operating income of the segments and use a variety of ratios to
    measure performance. These results are not necessarily
    indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred
    had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during
    the periods presented.

Net sales are based on the location in which the sale
    originated. Long-lived assets represent property, plant, and
    equipment, net of related depreciation.

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple
    markets and customers for which we do not have the financial
    systems to track revenues by primary product category. However,
    our net sales by segment is representative of our sales by major
    product category.

We sell our products through various distribution channels
    including wholesale and retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. In our Water segment, no single
    customer accounted for more than 10 percent of segment
    sales in 2005, one customer accounted for about 11 percent
    and 12 percent of segment sales in 2004 and 2003,
    respectively. In our Technical Products segment, no single
    customer accounted for more than 10 percent of segment
    sales in 2005, 2004, or 2003.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (PRPs) in a small number of environmental
    clean-ups, in which our current or former business units have
    generally been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of
    these claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses over the last ten years and in certain
    cases, such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper
    Corporation uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of
    the Federal Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the
    disposition of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition
    of the Tools Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and
    potential liability for certain environmental obligations. We
    have received claims for indemnification from purchasers both of
    the paper business and the ammunition business and have
    established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
    potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.
    We settled some of the claims in 2005 and 2003 and our recorded
    accrual was adequate.

In addition, there are pending environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relates to operations no
    longer carried out at that site. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at this
    and other sites. We do not believe that projected response costs
    will result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When it is probable and it is
    possible to provide reasonable estimates of our liability, with
    respect to environmental sites, provisions have been made in
    accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
    United States. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, our
    reserves for such environmental liabilities were approximately
    $6.4 million and $9.4 million, respectively, measured
    on an undiscounted basis. We cannot ensure that environmental
    requirements will not change or become more stringent over time
    or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies

, and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims could change in the future.

Product
    Liability Claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald our captive
    insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these
    claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For
    all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on
    an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated based on existing information. The accruals are
    adjusted periodically as additional information becomes
    available. We have not experienced significant unfavorable
    trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability
    lawsuits or personal injury claims.

Horizon
    Litigation

Twenty-eight separate lawsuits involving 29 primary plaintiffs,
    a class action, and claims for indemnity by Celebrity Cruise
    Lines, Inc. (Celebrity) were brought against Essef Corporation
    (Essef) and certain of its subsidiaries prior to our acquisition
    of Essef in August 1999. Celebrity has alleged that it had
    sustained economic damages due to loss of use of the M/V Horizon
    while it was dry-docked.

The claims against Essef and its involved subsidiaries were
    based upon the allegation that Essef designed, manufactured, and
    marketed two sand swimming pool filters that were installed as a
    part of the spa system on the Horizon, and allegations that the
    spa and filters contained Legionnaire’s disease bacteria
    that infected certain passengers on cruises from December 1993
    through July 1994.

The individual and class claims by passengers were tried and
    resulted in an adverse jury verdict finding liability on the
    part of the Essef defendants (70%) and Celebrity and its sister
    company, Fantasia (together 30%).



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    Consolidated Financial
    Statements — (continued)

After expiration of post-trial appeals, we paid all outstanding
    punitive damage awards of $7.0 million in the Horizon
    cases, plus interest of approximately $1.6 million, in
    January 2004. We had reserved for the amount of punitive damages
    awarded at the time of the Essef acquisition. A reserve for the
    $1.6 million interest cost was recorded in 2003. All of the
    personal injury cases have now been resolved through either
    settlement or trial.

The only remaining unresolved claims in this case are those
    brought by Celebrity for damages resulting from the outbreak.
    Celebrity filed an amended complaint seeking attorney fees and
    costs for prior litigation as well as

out-of-pocket

losses, lost profits, and loss of business enterprise value.
    Discovery commenced late in 2004, and was completed in August
    2005. Celebrity’s claims for damages exceed
    $185 million. Assuming matters of causation, standing,
    contribution and proof are decided against it, Essef’s
    experts believe that damages should amount to no more than
    approximately $16 to $25 million. Dispositive motions in
    this matter were filed in August 2005, which were decided in
    December 2005. Celebrity’s motion for indemnity from Essef
    for payments made by Celebrity for passenger claims of
    approximately $2.3 million was denied. Essef’s motion
    for dismissal of certain damage claims was denied without
    prejudice to renewal in conjunction with both parties’
    motions to exclude certain expert testimony. We expect these
    motions to be adjudicated in March 2006. Trial has been
    scheduled for April 24, 2006. We believe our reserves for
    any liability to Celebrity are adequate and intend to vigorously
    defend against these claims.

Warranties
    and Guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product
    lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various
    potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as
    pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or
    other obligations. The subject matter, amounts, and duration of
    any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of
    liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to
    transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such
    indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the
    overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably
    estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments
    for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur
    a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a
    material effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45
    (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Others

, we recognize, at the inception of a
    guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
    undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We have guaranteed the indebtedness of one customer, whose
    outstanding debt at December 31, 2005 was
    $1.1 million. The debt amount is a declining balance and
    scheduled to be paid in full by June 2007. The liability
    relating to the guarantee is not material.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products.
    Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a
    review of historical warranty and service claim experience.
    Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical
    experience warrant.

Stand-By
    Letters of Credit

In the ordinary course of business, predominantly for contracts
    and bids involving municipal pump products, we are required to
    commit to bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit to secure our performance to third parties under
    self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2005, the outstanding value of these
    instruments totaled $38.8 million. As of December 31,
    2004, the outstanding value of these instruments totaled
    $64.9 million, which included a $38.9 million stand-by
    letter of credit pertaining to an indemnified legal matter that
    was resolved in our favor during 2005, eliminating the bond
    requirement.

Selected
    Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)

In the fourth quarter of 2005, we adopted SFAS 123R,
    Stock-Based Payment, using the modified retrospective method as
    of January 1, 2005. As a result, quarterly financial
    information for 2005 has been restated from the previously filed
    quarterly financial information for the impact of the adoption
    of SFAS 123R, see Note 13 for the reconciliation. As
    we did not retrospectively adopt SFAS 123R for all periods,
    the 2004 quarterly financial data remains unmodified.

Financial
    Statements of Subsidiary Guarantors

The $250 million Senior Notes due 2009 are jointly and
    severally guaranteed by domestic subsidiaries (the
    “Guarantor Subsidiaries”), each of which is directly
    or indirectly wholly-owned by Pentair (the “Parent
    Company”). The following supplemental financial information
