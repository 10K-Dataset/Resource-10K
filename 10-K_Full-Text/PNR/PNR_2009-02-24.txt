Customers

Our Water Group distributes its products through wholesale
    distributors, retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, home centers and home and pool builders.
    Information regarding significant customers in our Water Group
    is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sale “early buy” programs
    (generally including



extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Competition

Our Water Group faces numerous domestic and international
    competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources
    directed to the markets in which we compete. Consolidation,
    globalization, and outsourcing are continuing trends in the
    water industry. Competition in commercial and residential flow
    technologies markets focuses on brand names, product
    performance, quality, and price. While home center and national
    retailers are important for residential lines of water and
    wastewater pumps, they are not important for commercial pumps.
    For municipal pumps, competition focuses on performance to meet
    required specifications, service, and price. Competition in
    water treatment and filtration components focuses on product
    performance and design, quality, delivery, and price. For pool
    equipment, competition focuses on brand names, product
    performance, quality, and price. We compete by offering a wide
    variety of innovative and high-quality products, which are
    competitively priced. We believe our distribution channels and
    reputation for quality also contribute to our continuing market
    penetration.

TECHNICAL
    PRODUCTS GROUP

Our Technical Products Group is a leader in the global
    enclosures and thermal management markets, designing and
    manufacturing standard, modified, and custom enclosures that
    house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical
    components; thermal management products; and accessories. We
    have identified a target market of $30 billion. Our
    Technical Products Group focuses its business portfolio on four
    primary industries: Commercial and Industrial (55% of group
    sales), Telecom and Datacom (20% of group sales), Electronics
    (20% of group sales), and Networking (5% of group sales). The
    primary brand names for the Technical Products Group are:

    subracks, backplanes, heat exchangers, and blowers. Applications
    served include industrial machinery, data communications,
    networking, telecommunications, test and measurement,
    automotive, medical, security, defense, and general electronics.

Customers

Our Technical Products Group distributes its products through
    electrical and data contractors, electrical and electronic
    components distributors, and original equipment manufacturers.
    Information regarding significant customers in our Technical
    Products Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our Technical Products Group is not significantly impacted by
    seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the technical products markets can be intense,
    particularly in telecom and datacom markets, where product
    design, prototyping, global supply, price competition, and
    customer service are significant factors. Our Technical Products
    Group has continued to focus on cost control and improving
    profitability. Recent growth in the Technical Products Group is
    a result of new products development, overall market growth,
    continued channel penetration, growth in targeted market
    segments, geographic expansion, price increases and
    acquisitions. Consolidation, globalization, and outsourcing are
    visible trends in the technical products marketplace and
    typically play to the strengths of a large and globally
    positioned supplier. We believe our Technical Products Group has
    the broadest array of enclosures products available for
    commercial and industrial uses.

RECENT
    DEVELOPMENTS

Growth
    of our business

We continually look at each of our businesses to determine
    whether they fit with our strategic vision. Our primary focus is
    on businesses with strong fundamentals and growth opportunities,
    including international



markets. We seek growth through product and service innovation,
    market expansion, and acquisitions. Acquisitions have played an
    important part in the growth of our business, and while we
    expect acquisitions to be an important part of our future
    growth, until economic and credit market conditions improve, we
    are not currently planning any significant acquisitions.

Acquisitions

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    Water & Process Technologies (a unit of General
    Electric Company) (“GE”) that was accounted for as an
    acquisition of an 80.1 percent ownership interest in
    GE’s global water softener and residential water filtration
    business in exchange for a 19.9 percent interest in our
    global water softener and residential water filtration business.
    The acquisition was effected through the formation of two new
    entities, (collectively, “Pentair Residential
    Filtration” or “PRF”) a U.S. entity and an
    international entity, into which we and GE contributed certain
    assets, properties, liabilities and operations representing our
    respective global water softener and residential water
    filtration businesses. We are an 80.1 percent owner of the new
    entities and GE is a 19.9 percent owner.

With the formation of this business, we believe PRF will be
    better positioned to serve residential customers with
    industry-leading technical applications in the areas of water
    conditioning, whole-house filtration, point of use water
    management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate
    revenue growth by selling GE’s existing residential
    conditioning products through our sales channels.

On May 7, 2007, we acquired as part of our Technical
    Products Group the assets of Calmark Corporation
    (“Calmark”), a privately held business. Calmark’s
    product portfolio includes enclosures, guides, card locks,
    retainers, extractors, card pullers and other products for the
    aerospace, medical, telecommunications and military market
    segments, among others.

On April 30, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all of the capital interests in Porous Media Corporation and
    Porous Media, Ltd. (together, “Porous Media”), two
    privately held filtration and separation technologies
    businesses. Porous Media brings strong technical ability to our
    Water Group, including engineering, material science, media
    development and application capabilities. Porous Media’s
    product portfolio includes high-performance filter media,
    membranes and related filtration products and purification
    systems for liquids, gases and solids for the general
    industrial, petrochemical, refining and healthcare market
    segments, among others.

On February 2, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jung Pumpen GmbH
    (“Jung Pump”). Jung Pump is a leading German
    manufacturer of wastewater products for municipal and
    residential markets. Jung Pump brings us its strong application
    engineering expertise and a complementary product offering,
    including a new line of water re-use products, submersible
    wastewater and drainage pumps, wastewater disposal units and
    tanks. Jung Pump also brings to Pentair its well-established
    European presence, a

state-of-the-art

training facility in Germany and sales offices in Germany,
    Austria, France, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia.

    Analysis, and ITEM 8, Note 2 of the Notes to

Discontinued
    operations/divestitures

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa and Bath
    (“Spa/Bath”) business to Balboa Water Group in a cash
    transaction.

On February 28, 2008, we sold our National Pool Tile
    (“NPT”) business unit to Pool Corporation in a cash
    transaction. National Pool Tile is the leading wholesale
    distributor of pool tile and composite pool finishes serving
    professional contractors in the swimming pool refurbish and
    construction markets.

The results of Spa/Bath and NPT have been reported as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
    and liabilities of Spa/Bath and NPT have been reclassified as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented.

%

The $21.1 million increase in Water Group backlog was
    primarily due to increased backlog for pumps used in industrial
    and municipal market applications and growth in Asian markets,
    partially offset by declining market conditions in residential
    pool and pump markets. The $13.2 million decrease in
    Technical Products Group backlog reflected declining market
    conditions in both our electrical and electronic markets. Due to
    the relatively short manufacturing cycle and general industry
    practice for the majority of our businesses, backlog, which
    typically represents less than 60 days of shipments, is not
    deemed to be a significant item. A substantial portion of our
    revenues result from orders received and product sold in the
    same month. We expect that most of our backlog at
    December 31, 2008 will be filled in 2009.

Research
    and development

We conduct research and development activities in our own
    facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new
    products, product applications, and manufacturing processes.
    Research and development expenditures during 2008, 2007, and
    2006 were $62.5 million, $56.8 million, and
    $56.5 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7,
    and in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Raw
    materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of our
    products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel,
    electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies),
    and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the purchase of
    raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for distribution
    through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are
    purchased on the open market, and the majority are available
    through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not
    experienced any significant work stoppages to-date due to
    shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments,
    principally price commitments, for the purchase of various
    component parts and raw materials and believe that it is
    unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated
    prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices
    are available for most materials for which long-term commitments
    exist, and we believe that the termination of any of these
    commitments would not have a material adverse effect on
    operations.

Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to
    market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these
    fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term
    agreements with escalator / de-escalator clauses. Prices for raw
    materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in the
    future.

Intellectual
    property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. However, we do not regard
    our business as being materially dependent upon any single
    patent, non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer
    relationship, trade mark, trade name, or brand name.



Patents, patent applications, and license agreements will expire
    or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with
    their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of
    patents, patent applications, and license agreements to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of December 31, 2008, we employed approximately 14,700
    people worldwide. Total employees in the United States were
    approximately 8,000, of whom approximately 850 are represented
    by five different trade unions having collective bargaining
    agreements. Generally, labor relations have been satisfactory.

Captive
    Insurance Subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by
    third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired
    businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain foreign
    operations are established without regard to the availability of
    insurance.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and
    warnings before making an investment decision. You are cautioned
    not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
    You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or
    identify all such factors and should not consider the following
    list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and
    uncertainties. If any of the risks described below actually
    occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations
    or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In that
    case, the price of our securities could decline and you could
    lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to
    other information set forth in this document.

General
    economic conditions, including difficult credit and residential
    construction markets, affect demand for our
    products.

We compete around the world in various geographic regions and
    product markets. Among these, the most significant are global
    industrial and commercial markets (for both the Water and
    Technical Products Groups) and residential markets (for the
    Water Group). The global credit crisis and recession have
    adversely affected the robustness of our markets as exemplified
    in the fourth quarter of 2008. Important factors for our
    businesses include the overall strength of the economy and our
    customers’ confidence in the economy; industrial and
    governmental capital spending; the strength of the residential
    and commercial real estate markets; unemployment rates;
    availability of consumer and commercial financing for our
    customers and end-users; and interest rates. New construction
    for residential housing and home improvement activity fell
    dramatically in both 2007 and 2008, which reduced revenue growth
    in each of the businesses within our Water Group. We believe
    that weakness in this market and the recent dramatic slowdown in
    our industrial and commercial markets will



likely continue to affect our revenues and margins throughout
    2009. Any continuing weakness in these markets beyond 2009 will
    negatively affect our sales and financial performance in future
    periods.

Our
    inability to sustain consistent organic growth or limit revenue
    decreases could adversely affect our financial
    performance.

Over the past three years, our organic growth was generated in
    part from expanding international sales, entering new
    distribution channels, price increases and introducing new
    products. To grow more rapidly than our end markets, we would
    have to continue to expand our geographic reach, further
    diversify our distribution channels, continue to introduce new
    products, and increase sales of existing products to our
    customer base. Difficult economic and competitive factors
    adversely affected our ability to sustain consistent organic
    growth in 2008, as revenues contracted in the fourth quarter. As
    a result of these economic conditions, that adversely impacted
    our anticipated financial performance, we did not meet our
    stated revenue growth targets in the fourth quarter and for the
    year 2008. We believe that our revenues will continue to decline
    as our markets weaken. Rather than focus our efforts primarily
    on broad-based revenue growth, we have chosen to limit our
    growth initiatives to specific end markets and geographies. We
    cannot assure you that these growth initiatives will be
    sufficient to offset revenue declines in other markets.

Our
    businesses operate in highly competitive markets, so we may be
    forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs.

Our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of
    their respective markets. Competition may force us to cut prices
    or to incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete
    on the basis of product design, quality, availability,
    performance, customer service and price. Present or future
    competitors may have greater financial, technical or other
    resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected
    business or businesses. We cannot assure you that these and
    other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
    future results of operations.

Material
    cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could
    continue to affect our results of operations.

Over the past few years, we have experienced material cost and
    other inflation in a number of our businesses. We are striving
    for greater productivity improvements and implementing selective
    increases in selling prices to help mitigate cost increases in
    raw materials (especially metals and resins), energy and other
    costs such as pension, health care and insurance. While these
    inflationary pressures have begun to abate in late 2008 and
    early 2009 as a result of general economic conditions, we may
    not be able to recognize the full benefit from this moderating
    or reversal of material cost and other inflation. In addition,
    the recent reversal of material cost inflation may not be
    sustainable once the economy begins to strengthen. We also are
    continuing to implement our excellence in operations initiatives
    in order to continuously reduce our costs. We cannot assure you,
    however, that these actions will be successful in managing our
    costs or increasing our productivity. Continued cost inflation
    or failure of our initiatives to generate cost savings or
    improve productivity would likely negatively impact our results
    of operations.

Seasonality
    of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our
    financial results.

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment in our primary
    markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs
    from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike is
    partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or
    “early buy” programs (generally including extended
    payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts. We cannot assure you that
    seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.



Intellectual
    property challenges may hinder product development and
    marketing.

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names, and brand
    names are important to our business. Intellectual property
    protection, however, may not preclude competitors from
    developing products similar to ours or from challenging our
    names or products. Over the past few years, we have noticed an
    increasing tendency for participants in our markets to use
    conflicts over and challenges to intellectual property as a
    means to compete. Patent and trademark challenges increase our
    costs to develop, engineer and market our products.

Our
    results of operations may be negatively impacted by
    litigation.

Our business exposes us to potential litigation, such as product
    liability claims relating to the design, manufacture, and sale
    of our products. While we currently maintain what we believe to
    be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot assure you
    that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable
    terms or that this insurance will provide adequate protection
    against potential liabilities. In addition, we self-insure a
    portion of product liability claims. A series of successful
    claims against us for significant amounts could materially and
    adversely affect our product reputation, financial condition,
    results of operations, and cash flows.

Reductions
    in our acquisition activity will likely slow our revenue growth
    or otherwise adversely affect our financial
    performance.

Over the past four years, much of our growth has resulted from
    acquisitions of businesses within our current business segments.
    While we intend to continue to evaluate acquisitions in these
    segments, given the current financial and economic environment,
    we currently do not expect to make significant acquisitions
    until credit markets and business conditions stabilize. We
    cannot assure you that we would be able to continue to grow or
    to limit revenue declines without making acquisitions.
    Acquisitions we may undertake could have a material adverse
    effect on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal
    quarters immediately following the acquisitions, while we
    attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into
    our operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not
    achieve the levels of profitability originally anticipated.

The
    availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on
    our financial performance.

Our plans to vigorously compete in our chosen markets will
    require additional capital for future acquisitions, capital
    expenditures, growth of working capital, and continued
    international and regional expansion. In the past, we have
    financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash from
    operations and debt financing. While we refinanced our primary
    credit agreements in the second quarter of 2007 on what we
    believe to be favorable terms, future acquisitions or other uses
    of funds may require us to expand our debt financing resources
    or to issue equity securities. Our financial results may be
    adversely affected if new financing is not available on
    favorable terms or if interest costs under our debt financings
    are higher than the income generated by acquisitions or other
    internal growth. In addition, future acquisitions could be
    dilutive to your equity investment if we issue additional stock
    as consideration. We cannot assure you that we will be able to
    issue equity securities or obtain future debt financing at
    favorable terms. Without sufficient financing, we will not be
    able to pursue our targeted growth strategy, and our acquisition
    program, which will limit our revenue growth and future
    financial performance.

We are
    exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from
    operating a multinational business.

Sales outside of the United States, including export sales from
    our domestic businesses, accounted for approximately 35% of our
    gross sales in 2008, up from 32% in 2007. Further, most of our
    businesses obtain some products, components and raw materials
    from foreign suppliers. Accordingly, our business is subject to
    the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in
    operating in numerous countries. These risks include:

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in
    countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;



•

relatively more severe economic conditions in some international
    markets than in the United States;

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing
    requirements;

•

tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the
    U.S. and the imposition of withholding requirements on foreign
    earnings;

•

the possibility of terrorist action against us or our operations;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other trade
    restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in

non-U.S.

labor markets;

•

the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in foreign
    countries; and

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations.

Our business success depends in part on our ability to
    anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We
    cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a
    material adverse effect on our international operations or on
    our business as a whole.

Our
    international operations are subject to foreign market and
    currency fluctuation risks.

We expect the percentage of our sales outside of North America
    to increase in the future. Over the past few years, the
    economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do
    business have had slower growth than the U.S. economy. The
    European Union currently accounts for the majority of our
    foreign sales and income, in which our most significant European
    market is Germany; each market area is currently experiencing
    similar economic difficulties to those in the United States, and
    sales in those markets slowed significantly by the end of 2008.
    In addition, we have a significant and growing business in the
    Asia-Pacific area, but the economic conditions in countries in
    this region are subject to different growth expectations, market
    weaknesses and business practices. We cannot predict how
    changing market conditions in these regions will impact our
    financial results.

We are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign
    currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results.
    In 2008, the weakness of the US dollar slightly benefited our
    financial results in foreign jurisdictions. We do not anticipate
    continuing US dollar weakness in foreign exchange markets in
    2009 of a similar magnitude, which may hurt our financial
    results on a comparative basis. In addition, we source certain
    products, components and raw materials throughout the world, the
    import of which into the United States has raised the cost of
    these goods in US dollars and has impacted the results of our
    domestic businesses as well.

We
    have significant goodwill and intangible assets, and future
    impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a
    material negative impact on our financial results.

We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment on an annual basis as required by Statement of
    Accounting Standards No. 142, “Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets” (SFAS No. 142), by comparing
    the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units to their
    respective carrying values on our balance sheet. At
    December 31, 2008 our goodwill and intangible assets were
    approximately $2,617.4 million, and represented
    approximately 64.6% of our total assets. While our annual
    assessment in 2008 did not indicate an impairment of goodwill at
    that time, long-term declines in projected future cash flows
    could result in future goodwill and intangible asset
    impairments. Because of the significance of our goodwill and
    intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

We are
    exposed to potential environmental and other laws, liabilities
    and litigation.

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
    regulations governing our environmental practices, public and
    worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment.
    Compliance with these environmental, health and safety
    regulations could require us to satisfy environmental
    liabilities, increase the



cost of manufacturing our products or otherwise adversely affect
    our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any
    violations of these laws by us could cause us to incur
    unanticipated liabilities that could harm our operating results
    and cause our business to suffer. We are also required to comply
    with various environmental laws and maintain permits, some of
    which are subject to discretionary renewal from time to time,
    for many of our businesses, and we could suffer if we are unable
    to renew existing permits or to obtain any additional permits
    that we may require.

We have been named as defendants, targets, or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a number of
    environmental

clean-ups

relating to our current or former business units. We have
    disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and, in
    certain cases, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers. We
    may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing
    business units, as well as both divested and acquired
    businesses. We have also made claims against third parties for
    indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental
    remediations or other obligations. We cannot assure you that we
    will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for
    such costs.

We cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not
    change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual
    environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Provisions
    of our Restated Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Minnesota
    law could deter takeover attempts.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under
    Minnesota law, and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent
    or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.

Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include
    provisions relating to the election, appointment and removal of
    directors, as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting
    requirements which could delay, prevent or make more difficult a
    merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control.
    In addition, our common share purchase rights could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us, which could deter some acquirers from making
    takeover proposals or tender offers. Also, the Minnesota
    Business Corporations Act contains control share acquisition and
    business combination provisions which could delay, prevent or
    make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
    other change of control. Our shareholders might view any such
    transaction as being in their best interests since the
    transaction could result in a higher stock price than the
    current market price for our common stock.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is in leased premises located in
    Golden Valley, Minnesota. We carry out our Water Group
    manufacturing operations at 23 plants located throughout
    the United States and at 18 plants located in 10 other
    countries. In addition, our Water Group has 33 distribution
    facilities and 36 sales offices located in numerous
    countries throughout the world. We carry out our Technical
    Products Group manufacturing operations at 8 plants located
    throughout the United States and 10 plants located in 8 other
    countries. In addition, our Technical Products Group has 7
    distribution facilities and 30 sales offices located in numerous
    countries throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their
    purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.



ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.

We comply with the requirements of Statement of Financial
    Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal
    Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $3.1 million and
    $3.5 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. See discussion



in ITEM 1 and ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements — Insurance
    subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these claims based
    on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For all other
    claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on an
    undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated based on existing information. The accruals are
    adjusted periodically as additional information becomes
    available. We have not experienced significant unfavorable
    trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability
    lawsuits or personal injury claims.

Stock
    Performance Graph

The following information under the caption “Stock
    Performance Graph” in this ITEM 5 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A
    or 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to the
    liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934, and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference
    into any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the
    Securities Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent we
    specifically incorporate it by reference into such a filing.

The following graph sets forth the cumulative total shareholder
    return on our common stock for the last five years, assuming the
    investment of $100 on December 31, 2003 and the
    reinvestment of all dividends since that date to
    December 31, 2008. The graph also contains for comparison
    purposes the S&P 500 Index and the S&P MidCap 400
    Index, assuming the same investment level and reinvestment of
    dividends.

By virtue of our market capitalization, we are a component of
    the S&P MidCap 400 Index. On the basis of our size and
    diversity of businesses, we have not found a readily
    identifiable peer group. We believe the S&P MidCap 400
    Index is an appropriate comparison. We have evaluated other
    published indices, but have determined that the results are
    skewed by significantly larger companies included in the
    indices. We believe such a comparison would not be meaningful.

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company
    comprised of two operating segments: Water and Technical
    Products. Our Water Group is a global leader in providing
    innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement,
    storage, treatment and enjoyment of water. Our Technical
    Products Group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal
    management markets, designing and manufacturing standard,
    modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive
    electronics and electrical components; thermal management
    products; and accessories. In 2009, we expect our Water Group
    and Technical Products Group to generate approximately 2/3 and
    1/3 of total revenues, respectively.

Our Water Group has progressively become a more important part
    of our business portfolio with sales increasing from
    approximately $125 million in 1995 to approximately
    $2.2 billion in 2008. We believe the water industry is
    structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for
    clean water and the large global market size (of which we have
    identified a target market totaling $60 billion). Our
    vision is to be a leading global provider of innovative products
    and systems used in the movement, storage, treatment and
    enjoyment of water.

On February 28, 2008, we sold our National Pool Tile
    (“NPT”) business to Pool Corporation in a cash
    transaction. The results of NPT have been reported as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
    and liabilities of NPT have been reclassified as discontinued
    operations for all periods presented.

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    Water & Process Technologies (a unit of General
    Electric Company) (“GE”) that was accounted for as an
    acquisition of an 80.1 percent ownership interest in
    GE’s global water softener and residential water filtration
    business in exchange for a 19.9 percent interest in our
    global water softener and residential water filtration business.
    The acquisition was effected through the formation of two new
    entities, (collectively, “Pentair Residential
    Filtration” or “PRF”) a U.S. entity and an
    international entity, into which we and GE contributed certain
    assets, properties, liabilities and operations representing our
    respective global water softener and residential water
    filtration businesses. We are an 80.1 percent owner of the new
    entities and GE is a 19.9 percent owner.

With the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration, we believe
    we will be better positioned to serve residential customers with
    industry-leading technical applications in the areas of water
    conditioning, whole house filtration, point of use water
    management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate
    revenue growth by selling GE’s existing residential
    conditioning products through our sales channels.

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa and Bath
    (“Spa/Bath”) business to Balboa Water Group in a cash
    transaction. The results of Spa/Bath have been reported as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
    and liabilities of Spa/Bath have been reclassified as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Our Technical Products Group operates in a large global market
    with significant potential for growth in industry segments such
    as defense, security, medical and networking. We believe we have
    the largest industrial and commercial distribution network in
    North America for enclosures and the highest brand recognition
    in the industry in North America. From mid-2001 through 2003,
    the Technical Products Group experienced



significantly lower sales volumes as a result of severely
    reduced capital spending in the industrial and commercial
    markets and over-capacity and weak demand in the data
    communication and telecommunication markets. From 2004 through
    2008, sales volumes increased due to the addition of new
    distributors, new products, price increases and higher demand in
    targeted markets.

Key
    Trends and Uncertainties

The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial
    performance in 2008 and will likely impact our results in 2009
    and beyond:

•

Many markets we serve have slowed dramatically as a result of
    the tumultuous credit markets and the resulting recession. We
    have identified specific product and geographic markets we serve
    that we believe will stagnate, contract or continue contracting
    in 2009, as noted below. We have begun and expect to continue to
    restructure our operations serving those markets to close
    facilities in order to reduce or relocate capacity, to reduce
    labor and material costs, to optimize our manufacturing
    footprint and to simplify our business structure. We have also
    identified specific markets in which we participate that we
    believe will continue to grow over this period and are
    selectively reinforcing our businesses in these markets. Because
    our businesses are significantly affected by general economic
    trends, further deterioration in our most important markets
    addressed below would likely have an adverse impact on our
    results of operation for 2009 and beyond.

•

New home building and new pool starts have contracted for each
    of the past three years in the United States and have started to
    slow significantly in Europe as well. We believe that
    construction of new homes and new pool starts in North America
    affect approximately 10% - 15% of sales of our water businesses,
    while repair, replacement and refurbishment accounts for
    approximately 15% - 20% of sales in these businesses. We expect
    the current recession to continue to adversely impact our sales
    for all or a significant portion of 2009. As sales of products
    into domestic residential end-markets in our Water Group
    business continued to slow appreciably, we have reduced our
    investments in businesses in those markets, and further
    restructured our operations by closing or downsizing facilities,
    reducing headcount and taking other market-related actions.

•

Industrial, communications and commercial markets for all of our
    businesses, including commercial and industrial construction,
    have also slowed significantly during the fourth quarter of
    2008, especially in December, and this weakness has continued
    throughout the early part of the first quarter of 2009. We have
    a high level of uncertainty over the course of the economy and
    hence the strength of many of our significant markets both in
    the United States and around the world for the balance of the
    year and beyond. We have reduced our investments in businesses
    in these markets, and further restructured our operations by
    closing or downsizing facilities, reducing headcount and taking
    other market-related actions.

•

We experienced material cost and other inflation in a number of
    our businesses during 2008. To offset this inflation, we
    implemented productivity improvements and selective increases in
    selling prices to help mitigate inflationary cost increases we
    experienced in base materials such as carbon steel, copper and
    resins and other costs such as health care and other employee
    benefit costs. We expect the current economic environment will
    result in price volatility for many of our raw materials;
    material costs have declined in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
    the first quarter of 2009, and we believe they will continue to
    decline so long as general economic conditions remain weak. We
    believe that these cost decreases we are experiencing will not
    begin to be fully realized in our results of operations until
    the second quarter of 2009.

•

As a result of the dramatic fall in securities and other
    investment markets over 2008, our unfunded pension liability
    increased from fiscal year end 2007 to fiscal year end 2008 from
    $147 million to $257 million, or an increase of
    $110 million primarily reflecting our reduced investment
    return and significantly lower asset values in our US defined
    benefit plans during 2008. We believe that this will increase
    our pension expense in 2009 over year-earlier levels, and more
    significantly, require an increase in our 2009 contributions to
    the plans to approximately $40-$45 million, an increase of
    over $30 million in the year.



•

We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of our net income. We
    define free cash flow as cash flow from continuing operating
    activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of
    property and equipment. Free cash flow for the full year 2008
    was approximately $164 million, or 72% of our net income.
    Our target for free cash flow in 2009 remains at 100% of net
    income, and we have instituted several measures internally to
    maintain our strong collection experience and to decrease our
    working capital. See our discussion of

Other financial
    measures

under the caption “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” in this report.

•

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is normally at seasonal highs from April to
    August. The magnitude of the sales spike is partially mitigated
    by employing some advance sale “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by economic conditions and
    weather patterns, particularly by heavy flooding and droughts.
    While we believe that this seasonality will continue in the
    second and third quarters of 2009, due to the unknown impact of
    the current economic situation, we are uncertain of the size and
    impact of the seasonal spike for the year, and contemplate that
    any seasonal impact will likely be less than in prior years.

•

We experienced year over year favorable foreign currency effects
    on net sales and operating results in 2007 and the first nine
    months of 2008, due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar in
    relation to other foreign currencies. Our currency effect is
    primarily for the U.S. dollar against the euro, which may or may
    not trend favorably in the future.

•

On June 28, 2008, we formed Pentair Residential Filtration
    in order to expand our product lines, accelerate opportunities
    to provide our customers complete water filtration systems,
    increase revenue growth and exploit cost synergy opportunities.
    The one-time gain on the transaction increased diluted earnings
    per share, on an after tax basis, by 86 cents in the second
    quarter of 2008. Integration and inventory

step-up

costs arising out of the formation of the PRF business amounted
    to approximately $7 million in 2008. We believe we will
    continue to incur integration costs as we combine facilities in
    this business throughout most of 2009.

•

The effective income tax rate for 2008 was 29.5%. We estimate
    our effective tax rate for the full year 2009 to be between 32%
    and 33%. We continue to actively pursue initiatives to reduce
    our effective tax rate. The tax rate in any quarter can be
    affected positively or negatively by adjustments that are
    required to be reported in the specific quarter of resolution.

Outlook

In 2009, our operating objectives include the following:

•

Restructuring our operations in challenging markets while
    investing in more favorable markets and geographies;

•

Increasing our vertical market focus within each of our Global
    Business Units to grow in those markets in which we have
    competitive advantages;

•

Driving operating excellence through lean enterprise
    initiatives, with special focus on sourcing and supply
    management, cash flow management, and lean operations;

•

Stressing proactive talent development, particularly in
    international management and other key functional areas; and

•

Completing integration of the newly formed PRF business and
    prior acquisitions, and realizing identified synergistic
    opportunities.

On February 3, 2009, we announced our results of operations
    for fiscal year 2008 and modified our earnings guidance for the
    first quarter of 2009 to a range of $0.20 to $0.30 per share on
    a diluted basis. Our prior guidance for the first quarter of
    2009, given in December 2008, was a range of $0.30 to $0.35 per
    share. Our



revised outlook for the quarter is based on what we believe will
    be a continuation of the order rates and level of economic
    activity realized in December and January lasting throughout the
    first quarter.

In December 2008, we also initiated earnings guidance for the
    year 2009 that anticipated our earnings to be approximately
    $1.70 to $2.00 per share on a diluted basis. This guidance has
    not been withdrawn or modified because we do not have sufficient
    certainty at this time to support any revision. We do caution,
    however, that we are uncertain of the economic performance
    trajectory, both in the United States and globally, for the
    calendar year. As noted above, significant deterioration in
    general economic conditions in our primary markets and
    geographies beyond what we have seen to date in the first
    quarter would adversely impact our revenues and financial
    performance.

This outlook is based on several variables. First, our guidance
    anticipates revenue declines in our businesses throughout 2009
    of approximately 10% as a result of overall market conditions,
    bringing our total revenue to approximately $3.0 billion
    for the full year. Second, we expect to get the benefit in the
    second, third and fourth quarters of 2009 of restructuring and
    other market-related expense reduction efforts taken during 2008
    and early in 2009. Third, we anticipate that our manufacturing
    productivity initiatives, in particular our materials sourcing
    programs, will improve through our lean enterprise initiatives
    and commodity deflation.

We have heightened our focus on increasing the conversion of our
    net income into free cash flow from that achieved in 2008. In
    addition, in response to continuing turbulence in the credit
    markets, we are taking actions we believe will help maintain our
    liquidity and increase our capital resources by allowing us to
    repay indebtedness at a faster rate than would otherwise be the
    case. We do not intend to implement our stock buyback program
    for 2009, as we have in the past, nor do we currently intend to
    make any significant cash acquisitions until credit markets and
    business conditions stabilize.

If economic conditions worsen in North America and Europe, then
    we expect that our sales, manufacturing productivity and cash
    flow may deteriorate from the current forecast. In that event,
    we would further reduce discretionary capital spending and
    selling, marketing and R&D costs as well as accelerate our
    restructuring actions in order to minimize the impact of these
    declines on our earnings per share. Conversely, if economic
    conditions hold up and improve over the year we would then have
    the flexibility to increase expenditures in our selling,
    marketing and R&D efforts to maximize organic sales growth
    in favorable markets in 2009 and to anticipate growth in 2010.

Our guidance assumes an absence of significant acquisitions or
    divestitures in 2009. In 2009, we may seek to expand our
    geographic reach internationally, expand our presence in our
    various channels to market and acquire technologies and products
    to broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional
    markets. We may also consider the divestiture or closure of
    discrete business units to further focus our businesses on their
    most attractive markets.

The ability to achieve our operating objectives and 2009
    guidance will depend, to a certain extent, on factors outside
    our control. See “Risk Factors” under Part I of
    this report.

The
    2.2 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2008 from
    2007 was primarily the result of:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases;



•

an increase in sales volume due to the formation of PRF and our
    2007 acquisitions of Jung Pumpen GmbH (“Jung Pump”)
    Porous Media Corporation and Porous Media, Ltd. (together
    “Porous Media”);

•

favorable foreign currency effects; and

•

higher Technical Products Group sales.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the downturn in the North American
    residential housing market throughout 2008 and other global
    markets in the fourth quarter.

The
    8.5 percent increase in consolidated net sales in 2007 from
    2006 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume due to our February 2, 2007
    acquisition of Jung Pump and our April 30, 2007 acquisition
    of Porous Media;

•

organic sales growth of approximately 2 percent for the
    full year 2007 (excluding acquisitions and foreign currency
    exchange), which included selective increases in selling prices
    to mitigate inflationary cost increases due to:

•

growth in the Europe and Asia-Pacific markets;

•

higher Technical Product sales into electrical markets;

•

higher second quarter sales of municipal pumps related to a
    large flood control project; and

•

growth in commercial and industrial water markets.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower Technical Products sales into North American electronics
    markets driven by contraction and consolidation in the
    telecommunication equipment industry which have delayed buying
    activity and by datacommunication projects reaching

end-of-life;

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    related to the downturn in the North American residential
    housing market and softness in residential pool construction
    markets; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The
    1.1 percent decrease in Water segment sales in 2008 from
    2007 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales decline (excluding acquisitions and foreign
    currency exchange) of 5.1 percent for the full year 2008,
    which included:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products into
    North American and Western European residential housing markets;
    and

•

second quarter 2007 sales of municipal pumps related to a large
    flood control project that did not recur in 2008.



These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases; and

•

continued growth in China and in other markets in Asia-Pacific
    as well as continued success in penetrating markets in Europe
    and the Middle East.

These
    decreases were further offset by:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by the formation of PRF and
    our 2007 acquisitions of Jung Pump and Porous Media; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The
    10.3 percent increase in Water segment sales in 2007 from
    2006 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales volume driven by our February 2, 2007
    acquisition of Jung Pump and our April 30, 2007 acquisition
    of Porous Media;

•

organic sales growth of 2 percent for the full year 2007
    (excluding acquisitions and foreign currency exchange), which
    included selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases:

•

continued growth in China and in other markets in Asia-Pacific
    as well as continued success in penetrating markets in Europe
    and the Middle East;

•

higher second quarter sales of municipal pumps related to a
    large flood control project; and

•

growth in commercial and industrial water markets.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

    into North American residential markets and softness in

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

Technical
    Products

The
    9.1 percent increase in Technical Products segment sales in
    2008 from 2007 was primarily the result of:

•

an increase in sales into electrical markets, which includes new
    products and selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases;

•

an increase in sales into electronics markets as sales to our
    datacommunication and telecommunications customers rebounded and
    we expanded into other vertical markets;

•

strong sales performance in Asia and Europe; and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

an organic sales decline in our North American electronics
    markets.

The
    5.1 percent increase in Technical Products segment sales in
    2007 from 2006 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales (excluding acquisitions and foreign currency
    exchange) which were up approximately 2 percent for the
    full year 2007 ,which included selective increases in selling
    prices to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

strong sales performance in Asia; and

•

increased sales into electrical markets.



These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

lower sales into North American electronics markets driven by
    contraction and consolidation in the telecommunication equipment
    industry which have delayed buying activity and by
    datacommunication projects reaching

end-of-life;

and

•

favorable foreign currency effects.

The

    of:

•

inflationary increases related to raw materials and labor costs;

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the downturn in the North American
    residential housing market and the slowing of residential

    value inventory

step-up

related to the formation of PRF; and

•

    consolidations.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

the gross margin impact from increased sales volume in our
    Technical Products Group and the resulting improved fixed cost
    leverage;

    Senior Notes due 2009 (the “Notes”). Upon expiration
    of the tender offer on August 4, 2008, we purchased
    $116.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. As
    a result of this transaction, we recognized a loss of
    $4.6 million on early extinguishment of debt. The loss
    included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized
    deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of
    $0.6 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash
    paid of $5.1 million related to the tender premium and

    measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities to account
    for changes in German tax law enacted on August 17, 2007.

The
    2.5 percentage point increase in the tax rate in 2007 from
    2006 was primarily the result of:

•

higher utilization of foreign tax credits in 2006; and

•

the favorable settlement in 2006 of prior years’ federal
    tax returns.

•

a favorable adjustment in 2007 related to the measurement of

We expect our full year effective tax rate in 2009 to be between
    32% and 33%. We will continue to pursue tax rate reduction
    opportunities.

LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital
    expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments,
    dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from
    operations, availability under existing committed revolving
    credit facilities, and in certain instances, public and private
    debt and equity offerings. We have grown our businesses in
    significant part over the past few years through acquisitions,
    such as Jung Pump and Porous Media in 2007, financed by credit
    provided under our revolving credit facilities and, from time to
    time, by private or public debt issuance. Our primary revolving
    credit facilities have generally been adequate for these
    purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit
    facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions; these
    are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within
    less than a year.

In light of the current global economic situation and the state
    of credit markets generally, we have instituted a more
    conservative financial policy. We do not currently plan to make
    any significant acquisitions in 2009, and we do not plan to
    continue in 2009 the annual share repurchase programs that we
    have undertaken over the



past few years. We are focusing on increasing our cash flow and
    maximizing debt repayment for the foreseeable future. Our intent
    is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid liquidity
    position.

We previously had a targeted

debt-to-total-capital

ratio of 40%, which could and had been exceeded from time to
    time as needed for operational purposes and, especially,
    acquisitions. Our capital structure as of December 31, 2008
    consisted of $954.1 million in total indebtedness and
    $1,898.7 million in shareholders’ equity. The ratio of

debt-to-total

capital was 33.4 percent, compared with 35.7 percent
    at year-end 2007 and 30.8 percent in 2006. In line with our
    new financial policy, we no longer target a particular

debt-to-total-capital

ratio, but we will strive to maintain our investment grade
    ratings.

Our current $800 million multi-currency revolving credit
    facility (the “Credit Facility”) was entered into in
    the second quarter of 2007 and does not expire until
    June 4, 2012. The agent banks under the Credit Facility are
    J. P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U. S. Bank and Bank
    of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. We have borrowing capacity of over
    $580 million at December 31, 2008, and the only
    significant required debt repayment before 2012 is for the
    retirement in October 2009 of the remaining 7.85% Senior Notes
    originally issued in 1999, of which approximately
    $134 million are currently outstanding.

We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal
    demand in a number of markets within our Water Group. We
    generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for
    operational purposes, which usage reverses in the second quarter
    as the seasonality of our businesses peaks. End-user demand for
    pool equipment follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal
    highs from April to August. The magnitude of the sales spike is
    partially mitigated by employing some advance sale “early
    buy” programs (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Operating
    activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $204.2 million in
    2008, or $137.1 million lower compared with the same period
    in 2007. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities
    was due primarily to an increase in working capital, higher
    prepaid expenses (particularly prepaid taxes) and lower income
    from continuing operations, excluding the gain from the
    formation of PRF.

Cash provided by operating activities was $341.3 million in
    2007, or $109.8 million higher compared with the same
    period in 2006. The increase in cash provided by operating
    activities was due primarily to working capital reductions
    during 2007 versus 2006 and higher net income.

In December 2008 and 2007, we sold approximately
    $44 million and $50 million, respectively, of a
    customer’s account receivable to a third-party financial
    institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk.
    In compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS’) No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,

sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a
    reduction of accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from
    operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. In 2008 and 2007, a loss in the amount of
    $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to the sale of
    accounts receivable is included in the line
    item

Other

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Investing
    activities

Capital expenditures in 2008, 2007, and 2006 were
    $53.1 million, $61.5 million and $50.9 million,
    respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2009
    to be approximately $45 to $50 million, primarily for
    capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing
    facilities, new product development, and general maintenance
    capital.

On May 7, 2007, we acquired as part of our Technical
    Products Group the assets of Calmark Corporation
    (“Calmark”), a privately held business, for
    $28.4 million, including a cash payment of
    $29.2 million and transaction costs of $0.2 million,
    less cash acquired of $1.0 million.



On April 30, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all of the capital interests in Porous Media, two privately held
    filtration and separation technologies businesses, for
    $224.9 million, including a cash payment of
    $225.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million,
    less cash acquired of $0.5 million.

On February 2, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jung Pump for
    $229.5 million, including a cash payment of
    $239.6 million and transaction costs of $1.3 million,
    less cash acquired of $11.4 million.

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa/Bath business to
    Balboa Water Group in a cash transaction for approximately
    $8.3 million subject to certain price adjustments based on
    working capital at closing. The results of Spa/Bath have been
    reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
    The assets and liabilities of Spa/Bath have been reclassified as
    discontinued operations for all periods presented.

On February 28, 2008, we sold our NPT business to Pool
    Corporation in a cash transaction for approximately
    $30.0 million subject to certain price adjustments. The
    results of NPT have been reported as discontinued operations for
    all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of NPT have
    been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented.

Cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of
    $4.7 million in 2008 was primarily related to the sale of a
    facility in our Water Group. Cash proceeds from the sale of
    property and equipment of $5.2 million in 2007 was
    primarily related to the sale of a facility used by our
    Technical Products Group.

Financing
    activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $217.2 million
    in 2008 versus net cash provided by financing activities of
    $222.7 in 2007. The difference in cash usage between the two
    years is primarily attributable to the three acquisitions in
    2007. Other financing activities included draw downs and
    repayments on our revolving credit facilities to fund our
    operations in the normal course of business, payments of
    dividends, cash used to repurchase Company stock, cash received
    from stock option exercises, and tax benefits related to
    stock-based compensation.

The Credit Facility creates an unsecured, committed revolving
    credit facility of up to $800 million, with multi-currency
    sub facilities to support investments outside the U.S. The
    Credit Facility expires on June 4, 2012. Borrowings under
    the Credit Facility bear interest at the rate of LIBOR plus
    0.50%. Interest rates and fees on the Credit Facility vary based
    on our credit ratings. We believe that internally generated
    funds and funds available under our Credit Facility will be
    sufficient to support our normal operations, dividend payments,
    stock repurchases (if authorized) and debt maturities over the
    life of the Credit Facility.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. Our
    use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the
    relative interest rates for our commercial paper compared to the
    cost of borrowing under our Credit Facility. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had $0.2 million of commercial
    paper outstanding that matures within 41 days. All of the
    commercial paper was classified as long-term as we have the
    intent and the ability to refinance such obligations on a
    long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

In May 2007, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with
    various institutional investors (the “Agreement”) for
    the sale of $300 million aggregate principal amount of our
    5.87% Senior Notes (“Fixed Notes”) and
    $105 million aggregate principal amount of our Floating
    Rate Senior Notes (“Floating Notes” and with the Fixed
    Notes, the “Notes”). The Fixed Notes are due in May
    2017. The Floating Notes are due in May 2012 and bear interest
    equal to the 3 month LIBOR plus 0.50%. The Agreement
    contains customary events of default.

We used $250 million of the proceeds from the sale of the
    Notes to retire a $250 million

364-day

Term
    Loan Agreement that we entered into in April 2007, which we used
    in part to pay the cash purchase price of our Porous Media
    acquisition which closed in April 2007.



Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the
    most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total
    consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated EBITDA,
    as defined) that may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. We were in
    compliance with all covenants under our debt agreements as of
    December 31, 2008.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $25.0 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had no
    borrowings as of December 31, 2008.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

Long-Term Debt

Current Rating

Rating Agency

Rating

Outlook

Standard & Poor’s

BBB

Negative

Moody’s

Baa3

Stable

Our long-term debt rating is an investment grade rating.
    Investment grade is a credit rating of BBB- or higher by
    Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 or higher by
    Moody’s.

On March 7, 2007, Standard & Poor’s Ratings
    Services revised its current rating outlook on us from stable to
    negative. At the same time, Standard & Poor’s
    affirmed its long-term debt rating of ‘BBB’.
    Standard & Poor’s stated that the outlook
    revision reflects the additional leverage and stress on credit
    metrics that would result from the acquisition of Porous Media.
    The negative outlook indicates the rating could be lowered if
    financial policies become more aggressive or if operating
    results are weaker than expected.

We believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial
    outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or
    cost of debt. A credit rating is a current opinion of the
    creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
    financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations,
    or a specific financial program. The credit rating takes into
    consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or
    other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes
    into account the currency in which the obligation is
    denominated. The ratings outlook also highlights the potential
    direction of a short or long-term rating. It focuses on
    identifiable events and short-term trends that cause ratings to
    be placed under observation by the respective rating agencies. A
    change in rating outlook does not mean a rating change is
    inevitable. Prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no
    immediate impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of
    debt.

We issue short-term commercial paper notes that are currently
    not rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.
    Even though our short-term commercial paper is unrated, we
    believe a downgrade in our long-term debt rating could have a
    negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated
    commercial paper.

We do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long-term
    debt by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
    would substantially affect our ability to access the long-term
    debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions,
    the amount, timing and pricing of new borrowings could be
    adversely affected. If both of our long-term debt ratings were
    downgraded to below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the
    term debt capital markets would be reduced.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support
    working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest
    and service debt, and to pay dividends to shareholders. In order
    to meet these cash requirements, we intend to use available cash
    and internally generated funds, and to borrow under our
    committed and uncommitted credit facilities.

We paid dividends in 2008 of $67.3 million, compared with
    $59.9 million in 2007 and $56.6 million in 2006. We
    recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2009
    from $0.68 per share in 2008 to $0.72 per share in 2009, which
    is the

rd

consecutive year in which we have increased our dividend.

In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a
    maximum dollar limit of $50 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had purchased 1,549,893 shares
    for $50 million pursuant to this authorization. This
    authorization expired on December 31, 2008. No
    authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock
    has been granted for 2009.

Our long-term debt obligations that are due in 2009 include
    $134.1 million that has been classified as long-term in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets as we have the intent and the
    ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis under
    the Credit Facility.

In addition to the summary of significant contractual
    obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on
    outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2008,
    variable interest rate debt, including the effects of derivative
    financial instruments, was $214.4 million at a weighted
    average interest rate of 1.21%.

Pension and post-retirement plan contributions are based on an
    assumed discount rate of 6.5% for all periods and an expected
    rate of return on plan assets ranging from 6.5% to 8.5%.

As of December 31, 2008, the gross liability for uncertain
    tax positions under FIN 48 is $28.1 million. We do not
    expect a significant payment related to these obligations to be
    made within the next twelve months. We are not able to provide a
    reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of future payments
    relating to the non-current FIN 48 obligations.

Other
    financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based
    upon operating, investing, and financing classifications
    included in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also
    measure our free cash flow and our conversion of net income. We
    have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100% conversion of net income. Free cash
    flow and conversion of net income are non-GAAP financial
    measures that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We
    believe free cash flow and conversion of net income are
    important measures of operating performance because they provide
    us and our investors a measurement of cash generated from
    operations that is available to pay dividends and repay debt. In
    addition, free cash flow and conversion of net income are used
    as a criterion to measure and pay compensation-based incentives.
    Our measure of free cash flow and conversion of net income may
    not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other
    companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free cash
    flow and a calculation of the conversion of net income with cash
    flows from continuing operations:

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with GAAP in the United States. As
    of December 31, 2008 and 2007, our undiscounted reserves
    for such environmental liabilities were approximately
    $3.1 million and $3.5 million, respectively. We cannot
    ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become
    more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Stand-by
    letters of credit

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to
    bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties
    under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, the outstanding value of these
    instruments totaled $64.5 million and $58.5 million,
    respectively.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently
    adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be
    adopted in the future.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. Our
    significant accounting policies are more fully described in
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the
    application of significant judgment by management in selecting
    the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
    By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our
    historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our



observance of trends in the industry, and information available
    from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an
    accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected would have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment
    of Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, and is
    tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The
    impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the
    first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including
    goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit, an indication that goodwill
    impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order
    to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any, that
    should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is
    recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of
    that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
    by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner
    similar to a purchase price allocation. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow
    analysis. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires is to
    make significant estimates regarding future revenues and
    expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working
    capital and the appropriate discount rate. The projections also
    take into account several factors including current and
    estimated economic trends and outlook, costs of raw materials,
    consideration of our market capitalization in comparison to the
    estimated fair values of our reporting units determined using
    discounted cash flow analyses and other factors which are beyond
    our control.

At December 31, 2008 our goodwill and intangible assets
    were approximately $2,617.4 million, and represented
    approximately 64.6% of our total assets. Declines in projected
    future cash flows could result in future goodwill and intangible
    impairments. Because of the significance of our goodwill and
    intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.

We completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment
    evaluation during the fourth quarter with each reporting
    unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value.
    Accordingly, step two of the impairment analysis was not
    required.

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, brand names, patents, non-compete agreements,
    proprietary technology, and customer relationships. Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,

identifiable intangibles with finite
    lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with
    indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible
    assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable
    intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for
    impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. The
    impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of
    the intangible asset with its carrying amount. During the fourth
    quarter of 2008, we completed our annual impairment test for
    those identifiable assets not subject to amortization and
    recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million. The charge
    was recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in
    our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying



value of the asset or asset group from the expected future
    pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)
    of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the
    carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized
    for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying
    value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are
    determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are
    reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement
    of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the
    fair value of long-lived assets.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
    consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from
    actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
    assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount
    rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels, and
    health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated
    annually and are disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 12 to the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these
    assumptions will affect pension expense, pension contributions
    and the funded status of our pension plans.

In December 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 158,

Employer’s Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and
    Other Postretirement Plans — an amendment of FASB
    Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R)

(“SFAS 158”). SFAS 158 requires that we
    recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined
    benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in
    our 2006 year-end balance sheet, with changes in the funded
    status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in
    which they occur.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments
    from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our U.S. plans of
    6.50% in 2008 and 2007 and 6.00% in 2006. The discount rates on
    our foreign plans ranged from 2.00% to 6.25% in 2008, 2.00% to
    5.25% in 2007 and 2.00% to 5.15% in 2006. There are no other
    known or anticipated changes in our discount rate assumption
    that will impact our pension expense in 2009.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2008 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2007 and 2006. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

See ITEM 8, Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information regarding pension
    plans.

ITEM 7A.
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET
    RISK

Market
    risk

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We
    are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative
    financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of some of
    these risks.



Counterparties to all derivative contracts are major financial
    institutions. All instruments are entered into for other than
    trading purposes. The major accounting policies and utilization
    of these instruments is described more fully in ITEM 8,
    Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our derivatives and other financial instruments consist of
    long-term debt (including current portion), short-term borrowing
    and interest rate swaps. The net market value of these financial
    instruments combined is referred to below as the net financial
    instrument position. As of December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, the net financial instrument position
    was a liability of $923.9 million and
    $1,076.5 million, respectively.

Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result
    in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement. In this
    case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable
    interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are
    at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for
    $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus .60% for
    $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all
    of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to
    continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if
    we continue to be in a net pay position.

Interest
    rate risk

Our debt portfolio, including swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2008 was comprised of debt predominantly
    denominated in U.S. dollars. This debt portfolio is comprised of
    56% fixed-rate debt and 44% variable-rate debt, not considering
    the effects of our interest rate swaps. Taking into account the
    variable to fixed rate swap agreement we entered with an
    effective date of April 2006 and August 2007, our debt portfolio
    is comprised of 78% fixed-rate debt and 22% variable-rate debt.
    Changes in interest rates have different impacts on the fixed
    and variable-rate portions of our debt portfolio. A change in
    interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio
    impacts the net financial instrument position but has no impact
    on interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates
    on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the
    interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net
    financial instrument position.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio,
    including the interest rate swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2008, a 100 basis point increase or decrease
    in interest rates would result in a $2.1 million increase
    or decrease in interest incurred.

Foreign
    currency risk

We conduct business in various locations throughout the world
    and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of
    foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the
    U.S. dollar. We generally do not use derivative financial
    instruments to manage these risks. The functional currencies of
    our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the
    country of domicile. We manage these operating activities at the
    local level and revenues, costs, assets, and liabilities are
    generally denominated in local currencies, thereby mitigating
    the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange. However,
    our results of operations and assets and liabilities are
    reported in U.S. dollars and thus will fluctuate with changes in
    exchange rates between such local currencies and the U.S. dollar.



ITEM 8.
    FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting is
    designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to maintenance of
    records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the
    Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
    subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
    reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated
    Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring
    Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this
    assessment, management believes that, as of December 31,
    2008, the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting was effective based on those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of year ended December 31, 2008. That
    attestation report is set forth immediately following this
    management report.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.:

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting,
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Managements Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.
    Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management, and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company
    are being made only in accordance with authorizations of
    management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
    reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at ITEM 15 as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2008, of the Company, and our
    report dated February 23, 2009, expressed an unqualified
    opinion on those consolidated financial statements and financial
    statement schedule.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the related consolidated
    statements of income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows
    for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2008. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company at December 31, 2008 and 2007, and the results of
    their operations and their cash flows for each of the three
    years in the period ended December 31, 2008, in conformity
    with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
    States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, presents
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

As discussed in Notes 1 and 11 to the consolidated
    financial statements, the Company changed its method of
    accounting for uncertain tax benefits in 2007 and as discussed
    in Notes 1 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements,
    the Company changed its method of accounting for defined benefit
    pension and postretirement benefit plans in 2006.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2008, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 23, 2009,
    expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting.

Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements

1.

Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31. We report our interim
    quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending on a Saturday.

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and

non-U.S.,

that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own 20% to
    50% of the voting stock or have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies of
    the investee are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting and, as a result, our share of the earnings or losses
    of such equity affiliates is included in the statement of
    income. The cost method of accounting is used for investments in
    which Pentair has less than a 20% ownership interest and we do
    not have the ability to exercise significant influence. These
    investments are carried at cost and are adjusted only for

other-than-temporary

declines in fair value.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates,
    actual results reported in future periods may be based upon
    amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical
    accounting policies that require our most significant estimates
    and judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including
    goodwill; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in
    making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue
    recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has
    been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery has occurred
    (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to
    the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is
    reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold
    other than warranty obligations in the normal, ordinary course
    of business. In the event significant post-shipment obligations
    were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred until
    substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Sales
    returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly with our
    customers. Our return policy allows for customer returns only
    upon our authorization. Goods returned must be product we
    continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of
    custom or modified goods are normally not allowed. At the time
    of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect of returns.
    Estimated sales returns include consideration of historical
    sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical sales
    return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type of
    customer, and a projection of this experience into the future.

Pricing
    and sales incentives

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
    and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements,
    promotions, and other volume-based incentives at the later of
    the date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered.
    Sales incentives given to our customers are recorded as a
    reduction of revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable
    benefit for the goods or services in exchange for the
    consideration and (2) we



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received.
    The following represents a description of our pricing
    arrangements, promotions, and other volume-based incentives:

Pricing
    arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers, and we
    record sales at the agreed upon net selling price. However, one
    of our businesses allows customers to apply for a refund of a
    percentage of the original purchase price if they can
    demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM customer. At the time of
    sale, we estimate the anticipated refund to be paid based on
    historical experience and reduce sales for the probable cost of
    the discount. The cost of these refunds is recorded as a
    reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as
    cooperative advertising. Under our cooperative advertising
    programs, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of
    sales as an allowance that may be used to advertise and promote
    our products. The customer is generally not required to provide
    evidence of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the
    cost of this cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The
    cost of this program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based
    incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front
    with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer
    achieves a specified cumulative level of sales or sales
    increase. Under these incentive programs, at the time of sale,
    we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on
    forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least
    quarterly, for each customer and sales are reduced for the
    anticipated cost of the rebate. If the forecasted sales for a
    customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect
    the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

Shipping
    and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
    recorded in

Net sales

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by
    Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

Cost of goods sold

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Cash
    equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities
    of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade
    receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts; reducing our
    receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from
    our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience,
    current trends, aging of accounts receivable, and periodic
    credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition.
    We generally do not require collateral. No customer receivable
    balances exceeded 10% of total net receivable balances as of
    December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively.

In December 2008 and 2007, we sold approximately
    $44 million and $50 million, respectively, of one
    customer’s accounts receivable to a third-party financial
    institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk.
    In compliance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
    (“SFAS’) No. 140,

Accounting for Transfers and
    Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of
    Liabilities,

sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a
    reduction of accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance
    Sheets and the proceeds are included in the cash flows from
    operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash
    Flows. In 2008 and 2007, a loss in the amount of
    $0.5 million and $1.2 million related to the sale of
    accounts receivable is included in the line
    item

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
    substantially all costed using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and with an insignificant
    amount of inventories located outside the United States costed
    using a moving average method which approximates FIFO.

Property,
    plant, and equipment

Property, plant, and equipment is stated at historical cost. We
    compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the
    following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or
    extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for
    repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When
    property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
    and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group,
    an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between
    estimated fair value and carrying value. Impairment losses on
    long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar
    manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to
    dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us
    to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived
    assets.

Goodwill
    and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment, and is
    tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The
    impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the
    first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including
    goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit, an indication that goodwill
    impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order
    to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any, that
    should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is
    recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of
    that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
    by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner
    similar to a purchase price allocation. The fair value of each
    reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow
    analysis. Projecting discounted future cash flows requires is to
    make significant estimates regarding future revenues and
    expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working
    capital and the appropriate discount rate. The projections also
    take into account several factors including current and
    estimated economic trends and outlook, costs of raw materials,
    consideration of our market capitalization in comparison to the
    estimated fair values of our reporting units determined using
    discounted cash flow analyses and other factors which are beyond
    our control.

At December 31, 2008 our goodwill and intangible assets
    were approximately $2,617.4 million, and represented
    approximately 64.6% of our total assets. Declines in projected
    future cash flows could result in



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

future goodwill and intangible impairments. Because of the
    significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future
    impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect
    on our financial statements.

We completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment
    evaluation during the fourth quarter with each reporting
    unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value.
    Accordingly, step two of the impairment analysis was not
    required.

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, brand names, patents, non-compete agreements,
    proprietary technology, and customer relationships. Under the
    provisions of SFAS No. 142,

Goodwill and Other
    Intangible Assets,

identifiable intangibles with finite
    lives are amortized and those identifiable intangibles with
    indefinite lives are not amortized. Identifiable intangible
    assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for
    impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
    that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Identifiable
    intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for
    impairment annually or more frequently if events warrant. The
    impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of
    the intangible asset with its carrying amount. During the fourth
    quarter of 2008, we completed our annual impairment test for
    those identifiable assets not subject to amortization and
    recorded an impairment charge of $1.0 million. The charge
    was recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in
    our Consolidated Statements of Income.

Cost
    and equity method investments

We have investments that are accounted for at historical cost
    or, if we have significant influence over the investee, using
    the equity method. Our proportionate share of income or losses
    from investments accounted for under the equity method is
    recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We write down
    or write off an investment and recognize a loss when events or
    circumstances indicate there is impairment in the investment
    that is

other-than-temporary.

This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the
    investees’ financial condition and in certain cases the
    possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the
    investees’ historical and projected results of operations
    and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are
    significantly different from projections, we may incur future
    charges for the impairment of these investments.

Income
    taxes

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48,

Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes,

the Company
    recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those
    positions are more likely than not of being sustained.
    Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest
    amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized.
    Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the
    period in which the change in judgment occurs.

We use the asset and liability approach to account for income
    taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
    the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are
    reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
    management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in
    valuation allowances from period to period are included in our
    tax provision in the period of change.

Environmental

In accordance with

SOP 96-1,

Environmental Remediation Liabilities,

we recognize
    environmental

clean-up

liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not
    subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental

clean-up

is
    estimated by engineering, financial, and legal specialists based
    on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the
    likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible
    parties (“PRPs”) will be able to fulfill their
    commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and
    severally liable. The process of estimating environmental

clean-up

liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and
    extent of historical information and physical data relating to a
    contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty
    as to what remedy and technology will be required, and the
    outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs
    at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or
    regulations, advances in

clean-up

technologies, and additional information about the ultimate

clean-up

remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.
    Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in

Other
    current liabilities

and

Other non-current liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance
    subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation, and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, reserves
    for policy claims were $59.2 million ($10.0 million
    included in

Accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $49.2 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

) and $61.4 million ($10.0 million
    included in

Accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $51.4 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

), respectively.

Stock-based
    compensation

We account for the fair value recognition provisions of
    SFAS No. 123R (revised 2004),

Share Based
    Payment,

(“SFAS 123R”) which revised
    SFAS No. 123,

Accounting for Stock-Based
    Compensation

(“SFAS 123”) and supersedes
    Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25,

Accounting
    for Stock Issued to Employees

(“APB 25”)
    requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of
    our stock-based compensation awards.

In accordance with SFAS 123R, the estimated grant date fair
    value of each stock-based award is recognized in income on an
    accelerated basis over the requisite service period (generally
    the vesting period). The estimated fair value of each option is
    calculated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. From
    time to time, we have elected to modify the terms of the
    original grant. These modified grants are accounted for as a new
    award and measured using the fair value method under
    SFAS 123R, resulting in the inclusion of additional
    compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
    Non-vested share awards are recorded as compensation cost over
    the requisite service periods based on the market value on the
    date of grant.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
    by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
    including the dilutive effects of common stock equivalents. The
    dilutive effects of stock options and non-vested shares
    increased weighted average common shares outstanding by 1,181
    thousand, 1,443 thousand and 1,587 thousand in 2008, 2007 and
    2006, respectively.

Stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings
    per share because the exercise price was greater than the
    average market price of the common shares were 5,268 thousand,
    2,841 thousand, and 3,089 thousand in 2008, 2007 and 2006,
    respectively.

Derivative
    financial instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other
    contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative is designated as
    a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If
    the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow
    hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded
    in other



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are recognized in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income when the hedged item affects
    earnings. If the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist
    or if the hedge becomes ineffective, all changes in fair value
    of the related derivatives that have not been settled are
    recognized in current earnings. For a derivative that is not
    designated as or does not qualify as a hedge, changes in fair
    value are reported in earnings immediately.

We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
    interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of
    ongoing business operations. All hedging instruments are
    designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with the
    provisions of SFAS No. 133,

Accounting for
    Derivative Instruments and Hedge Activities,

as amended. We
    do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
    trading or speculative purposes. All other contracts that
    contain provisions meeting the definition of a derivative also
    meet the requirements of, and have been designated as, normal
    purchases or sales. Our policy is not to enter into contracts
    with terms that cannot be designated as normal purchases or
    sales.

Foreign
    currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the
    United States are measured using the local currency as the
    functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the
    balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at
    average monthly rates of exchange. The resultant translation
    adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive
    income, a separate component of shareholders’ equity.

New
    accounting standards

In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157,

Fair Value Measurements

(“SFAS 157”).
    SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for
    measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value
    measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value
    measurements, but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance
    found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157
    is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15,
    2007 (adopted by Pentair as of January 1, 2008), with the
    exception of the application of the statement to the
    determination of fair value of nonfinancial assets and
    liabilities that are recognized or disclosed on a nonrecurring
    basis, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2008.

SFAS 157 establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure
    of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value. This
    hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as
    follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in
    active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2
    inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
    active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or
    liability, either directly or indirectly through market
    corroboration, for substantially the full term of the financial
    instrument. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs based
    upon our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities
    at fair value. A financial asset or liability’s
    classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the
    lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159,

The
    Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial
    Liabilities

(“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159
    permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments
    and certain other items at fair value that are not currently
    required to be measured at fair value (“the Fair Value
    Option”). SFAS 159 is effective for fiscal years
    beginning after November 15, 2007. We have not chosen the
    Fair Value Option; therefore, the adoption of SFAS 159 did
    not have any impact on our consolidated results of operations
    and financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141
    (Revised 2007),

Business Combinations

(“SFAS 141R”). SFAS 141R replaces
    SFAS No. 141. SFAS 141R retains the purchase
    method of accounting for acquisitions, but requires a number of
    changes, including changes in the way assets and liabilities are
    recognized in the purchase accounting. SFAS 141R also
    changes the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities
    assumed



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

arising from contingencies, requires the capitalization of
    in-process research and development at fair value, and requires
    the expensing of acquisition-related costs as incurred.
    SFAS 141R is effective for business combinations for which
    the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first
    annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15,
    2008. We will apply SFAS 141R prospectively to business
    combinations completed on or after that date. We do not expect
    adoption to have a significant impact to our current
    consolidated results of operations and financial condition.

In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160,

Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial
    Statements, an amendment of ARB 51

(“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 changes the
    accounting and reporting for minority interests. Minority
    interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests
    and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the
    parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests
    that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for
    as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to
    the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net
    income on the face of the income statement and upon a loss of
    control, the interest sold, as well as any interest retained,
    will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized
    in earnings. SFAS 160 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008,
    and interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the
    presentation and disclosure requirements, which will apply
    retrospectively. Upon adoption, we will classify minority
    interest as a component of equity for all periods presented.

In March 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
    (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting
    Standards (“SFAS”) No. 161,

Disclosures about
    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of
    FASB statement No. 133

(“SFAS 161”).
    SFAS 161 expands the disclosure requirements in Statement
    133 about an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging
    activities. SFAS 161 is effective for financial statements
    issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after
    November 15, 2008. The adoption of SFAS 161 will not
    have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations
    and financial condition.

Acquisitions

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    Water & Process Technologies (a unit of General
    Electric Company) (“GE”) that was accounted for as an
    acquisition of an 80.1 percent ownership interest in
    GE’s global water softener and residential water filtration
    business in exchange for a 19.9 percent interest in our
    global water softener and residential water filtration business.
    The acquisition was effected through the formation of two new
    entities (collectively, “Pentair Residential
    Filtration” or “PRF”), a U.S. entity and an
    international entity, into which we and GE contributed certain
    assets, properties, liabilities and operations representing our
    respective global water softener and residential water
    filtration businesses. We are an 80.1 percent owner of PRF
    and GE is a 19.9 percent owner. The fair value of the
    acquisition was $229.2 million, which includes
    approximately $3.3 million of acquisition related costs.
    The acquisition and related sale of our 19.9 percent
    interest resulted in a gain of $109.6 million
    ($85.8 million after tax), representing the difference
    between the carrying amount and the fair value of the 19.9
    percent interest sold.

With the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration, we believe
    we will be better positioned to serve residential customers with
    industry-leading technical applications in the areas of water
    conditioning, whole-house filtration, point of use water
    management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate
    revenue growth by selling GE’s existing residential
    conditioning products through our sales channels.

The fair value of the 80.1% interest in the global water
    softener and residential water filtration business of
    GE Water and Process Technologies acquired was determined
    using both an income approach and a market approach. The income
    approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis based on
    certain key assumptions including a discount rate based on a
    computed weighted average cost of capital and expected long-term
    revenue and expense growth rates. The market approach indicates
    the fair value of a business based on a comparison of the
    business to guideline publicly traded companies and transactions
    in its industry.

The fair value of the business acquired was allocated to the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated
    fair values. The excess of the fair value acquired over the
    identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
    reflected as goodwill. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase
    price allocation was approximately $137.9 million, none of
    which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired
    as part of the acquisition were $66.5 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as customer relationships,
    proprietary technology and trade names with a weighted average
    amortization period of approximately 15 years. We continue
    to evaluate the purchase price allocation, including tangible
    and intangible assets, which primarily consist of trademarks,
    proprietary technology and customer relationships, contingent
    liabilities and liabilities associated with exit or disposal
    activities, and expect to revise the purchase price allocation
    in future periods as these estimates are finalized. The
    following table represents the preliminary purchase price
    allocation:

On May 7, 2007, we acquired as part of our Technical
    Products Group the assets of Calmark Corporation
    (“Calmark”), a privately held business, for
    $28.4 million, including a cash payment of
    $29.2 million and transaction costs of $0.2 million,
    less cash acquired of $1.0 million. Calmark’s results
    of operations have been included in our consolidated financial
    statements since the date of acquisition. Calmark’s product
    portfolio includes enclosures, guides, card locks, retainers,
    extractors, card pullers and other products for the aerospace,
    medical, telecommunications and military market segments, among
    others. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase price
    allocation was $11.7 million, all of which is tax
    deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of
    the acquisition were $14.0 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as non-compete agreements,
    customer relationships and proprietary technology of
    $10.5 million with a weighted average amortization period
    of approximately 8 years.

On April 30, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all of the capital interests in Porous Media Corporation and
    Porous Media, Ltd. (together, “Porous Media”), two
    privately held filtration and separation technologies
    businesses, for $224.9 million, including a cash payment of
    $225.0 million and transaction costs of $0.4 million,
    less cash acquired of $0.5 million. Porous Media’s
    results of operations have been included in our consolidated
    financial statements since the date of acquisition. Porous Media
    brings strong technical ability to our Water Group, including
    engineering, material science, media development and application
    capabilities. Porous Media’s product portfolio includes
    high-performance filter media, membranes and related filtration
    products and purification systems for liquids, gases and solids
    for the general industrial, petrochemical, refining and
    healthcare market segments, among others. Goodwill recorded as
    part of the purchase price allocation was $128.1 million,
    all of which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets
    acquired as part of the acquisition were $73.8 million,
    including definite-lived intangibles, such as proprietary
    technology and customer relationships of $60.6 million with
    a weighted average amortization period of approximately
    11 years.

On February 2, 2007, we acquired as part of our Water Group
    all the outstanding shares of capital stock of Jung Pumpen GmbH
    (“Jung Pump”) for $229.5 million, including a
    cash payment of $239.6 million and transaction costs of
    $1.3 million, less cash acquired of $11.4 million.
    Jung Pump’s results of operations have been included in our
    consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition.

strong application engineering expertise and a complementary
    product offering, including a new line of water re-use products,
    submersible wastewater and drainage pumps, wastewater disposal
    units and tanks. Jung Pump also brings to Pentair its
    well-established European presence, a

state-of-the-art

training facility in Germany and sales offices in Germany,
    Austria, France, Hungary, Poland and Slovakia. Goodwill recorded
    as part of the purchase price allocation was
    $123.4 million, of which approximately $53 million is
    tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part
    of the acquisition were $135.7 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, primarily customer relationships of
    $71.6 million with a weighted average amortization period
    of approximately 15 years.

Discontinued
    Operations/Divestitures

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa and Bath
    (“Spa/Bath”) business to Balboa Water Group in a cash
    transaction for $8.3 million including certain price
    adjustments based on working capital at closing. The results of
    Spa/Bath have been reported as discontinued operations for all
    periods presented. The assets and liabilities of Spa/Bath have
    been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods

    certain price adjustments. The results of NPT have been reported
    as discontinued operations for all periods presented. The assets
    and liabilities of NPT have been reclassified as discontinued

Restructuring

During 2008, we announced and initiated certain business
    restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed cost
    structure and rationalizing our manufacturing footprint. These
    initiatives included the announcement of the closure of certain
    manufacturing facilities as well as the reduction in hourly and
    salaried headcount of approximately 1,700 employees, 1,300 in
    the Water Group and 400 in the Technical Products Group. We
    expect these actions to generally be completed by the end of
    2009.

Cost
    method investments

As part of the sale of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, we received
    37,500 shares of 5% Series C Junior Convertible
    Redeemable Preferred Stock convertible into a 15% equity
    interest in the new organization — LN Holdings
    Corporation. During the second quarter of 2005 we sold our
    interest in the stock of LN Holdings Corporation for cash
    consideration of $23.6 million, resulting in a pre-tax gain
    of $5.2 million or an after-tax gain of $3.5 million.
    The terms of the sale agreement established two escrow accounts
    totaling $14 million. We received payments from an escrow
    of $0.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2005,
    increasing our gain. During 2006 we received $1.2 million
    from the escrow accounts which also increased our gain from the
    sale. Remaining escrow balances are to be distributed to former
    shareholders in accordance with their ownership percentages. Any
    funds received from settlement of escrows in future periods will
    be accounted for as additional gain on sale of this interest.

Equity
    method investments

We have a 50% investment in FARADYNE Motors LLC
    (“FARADYNE”), a joint venture with ITT Water
    Technologies, Inc. that began design, development, and
    manufacturing of submersible pump motors in 2005. We do not
    consolidate the investment in our financial statements as we do
    not have a controlling interest over the investment. There were
    no investments in or loans to FARADYNE in 2008. There were
    investments in and loans to FARADYNE of $5.0 million and
    $8.7 million at December 31, 2008 and
    December 31, 2007, respectively, which is net of our
    proportionate share of the results of their operations.

We have a multi-currency revolving Credit Facility (“Credit
    Facility”). The Credit Facility creates an unsecured,
    committed revolving credit facility of up to $800 million,
    with multi-currency sub facilities to support investments
    outside the U.S. The Credit Facility expires on June 4,
    2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest at
    the rate of LIBOR plus 0.50%. Interest rates and fees on the
    Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

Total availability under our existing Credit Facility was
    $585.6 million at December 31, 2008.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. Our
    use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the
    relative interest rates for our paper compared to the cost of
    borrowing under our Credit Facility. As of December 31,
    2008, we had $0.2 million of commercial paper outstanding
    that matures within 41 days.

All of the commercial paper and Senior Notes were classified as
    long-term as we have the intent and the ability to refinance
    such obligations on a long-term basis under the Credit Facility.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $25.0 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had no
    borrowings as of December 31, 2008.

Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the
    most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total
    consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated EBITDA,
    as defined) that may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. We were in
    compliance with all covenants in our debt agreements as of
    December 31, 2008.

On July 8, 2008, we commenced a cash tender offer for all
    of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal 7.85%
    Senior Notes due 2009 (the “Notes”). Upon expiration
    of the tender offer on August 4, 2008, we purchased
    $116.1 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. As
    a result of this transaction, we recognized a loss of
    $4.6 million on early extinguishment of debt. The loss
    included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized
    deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of
    $0.6 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash
    paid of $5.1 million related to the tender premium and
    other costs associated with the purchase.

10.  Derivative
    and Financial Instruments

Cash-flow hedges

In August 2007, we entered into a $105 million interest
    rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for a fixed
    rate obligation without the exchange of the underlying principal
    amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. The
    effective date of the swap was August 30, 2007. The swap
    agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.89% and expires in May
    2012. The fixed interest rate of 4.89% plus the .50% interest
    rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective fixed interest
    rate of 5.39%. The fair value of the swap was a liability of
    $10.7 million and $3.7 million at December 31,
    2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively, and was recorded
    in

Other non-current liabilities

.

In September 2005, we entered into a $100 million interest
    rate swap agreement with several major financial institutions to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for fixed
    rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying
    principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures.
    The effective date of the fixed rate swap was April 25,
    2006. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.68% and
    expires in July 2013. The fixed interest rate of 4.68% plus the
    .60% interest rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective
    fixed interest rate of 5.28%. The fair value of the swap was a
    liability of $11.6 million and $2.5 million at
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively,
    and was recorded in

Other non-current liabilities

.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as and
    are effective as cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps
    are recorded as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, with changes in their fair value included in

Accumulated other comprehensive income

(“OCI”).
    Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are reclassified
    into earnings at the time the related interest expense is
    recognized or the settlement of the related commitment occurs.

Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result
    in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement. In this
    case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable
    interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are
    at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for
    $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus .60% for
    $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all
    of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to
    continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if
    we continue to be in a net pay position.

At December 31, 2008, our interest rate swaps are carried
    at fair value measured on a recurring basis. Fair values are
    determined through the use of models that consider various
    assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as
    other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are
    classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined by
    SFAS 157.

The following methods were used to estimate the fair values of
    each class of financial instrument:

•

short-term financial instruments (cash and cash equivalents,
    accounts and notes receivable, accounts and notes payable, and
    variable rate debt) —  recorded amount approximates
    fair value because of the short maturity period;

•

long-term fixed rate debt, including current
    maturities — fair value is based on market quotes
    available for issuance of debt with similar terms, which are
    inputs that are classified as Level 2 in the valuation
    hierarchy defined by SFAS 157; and

•

interest rate swap agreements — fair values are
    determined through the use of models that consider various
    assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as
    other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are
    classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy defined by

Included in the $28.1 million of total gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 was $25.2 million
    of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective
    tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2008 may decrease by a
    range of $0 to $14.5 million during the next twelve months
    primarily as a result of the resolution of federal, state and
    foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of
    limitations.

The determination of annual income tax expense takes into
    consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for
    open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    has examined our U.S. federal income tax returns through 2003
    with no material adjustments. The IRS has also completed a
    survey of our 2004 U.S. federal income tax return with no
    material findings. In connection with the completion of the 2002
    to 2003 federal income tax audit and the 2004 survey, we
    recognized benefits of $8.0 million and $1.8 million
    in our second and third quarter 2006 income statements,
    respectively. The IRS is currently examining our

    (continued)

2005 and 2006 federal tax returns. No adjustments have been
    proposed; however, actual settlements may differ from amounts
    accrued.

We record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in

Provision for income taxes

and

Net
    interest expense,

respectively, which is consistent with our
    past practices. As of December 31, 2008, we had recorded
    approximately $0.6 million for the possible payment of
    penalties and $4.6 million related to the possible payment
    of interest.

United States income taxes have not been provided on
    undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our
    intention to reinvest these earnings permanently or to
    repatriate the earnings only when it is tax effective to do so.
    As of December 31, 2008, approximately $145.1 million
    of unremitted earnings attributable to international
    subsidiaries were considered to be indefinitely invested. It is
    not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be
    payable if such earnings were to be remitted.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of
    these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets”
    (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
    in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities”
    (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the
    tax impact has not yet been recorded in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income).

The tax effects of the major items recorded as deferred tax
    assets and liabilities are as follows:

Benefit
    Plans

Pension
    and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based
    principally on an employee’s years of service

and/or

compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also
    provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance
    benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life
    insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a
    December 31 measurement date each year.

In 2007, under the requirements of SFAS No. 88,

Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments
    of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination
    Benefits,

we recognized a pension curtailment gain of
    $5.5 million related to the announcement that we will be
    freezing certain pension plans as of December 31, 2017.
    Also, we recognized a curtailment gain of $4.1 million
    related to the termination of certain post-retirement health
    care benefits.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments
    from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our U.S. plans of
    6.50% in 2008, 6.50% in 2007 and 6.00% in 2006. The discount
    rates on our foreign plans ranged from 2.00% to 6.25% in 2008,
    2.00% to 5.25% in 2007 and 2.00% to 5.15% in 2006. There are no
    other known or anticipated changes in our discount rate
    assumption that will impact our pension expense in 2009.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets in 2008 equaled 8.5%,
    which remained unchanged from 2007 and 2006. The expected rate
    of return is designed to be a long-term assumption that may be
    subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices. In 2008, the pension plan assets
    yielded a loss of 28.8 %, compared to returns of 7.8% in 2007
    and 12.3% in 2006.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a

five-year

period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or
    losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected
    return calculated using the market-related value of assets and
    the actual return based on the market-related value of assets.
    Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or
    losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Unrecognized
    pension and post-retirement losses

As of our December 31, 2008 measurement date, our plans
    have $95.7 million of cumulative unrecognized losses. To
    the extent the unrecognized losses, when adjusted for the
    difference between market and market related values of assets,
    exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, it will be
    amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over
    the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active
    participants (currently approximating 12 years).

The assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31 are as
    follows:



Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year

The assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant

Objective

The primary objective of our investment strategy is to meet the
    pension obligation to our employees at a reasonable cost to the
    company. This is primarily accomplished through growth of
    capital and safety of the funds invested. The plans will
    therefore be actively invested to achieve real growth of capital
    over inflation through appreciation of securities held and
    through the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and
    interest income.

During 2008, as part of our regular practice of reviewing asset
    allocations and assessing target allocations, we increased the
    targeted fixed income allocation from 10% to 30% and reduced the
    equity securities allocation and alternative investment
    allocation by 10% each. The transition to these new target
    allocations will be conducted in an orderly manner. We plan to
    increase our allocation to long duration fixed income securities
    in future years as the funded status of our U.S. pension plans
    improve.

While the target allocations do not have a percentage allocated
    to cash, the plan assets will always include some cash due to
    cash flow.

Equity securities include Pentair common stock in the amount of
    $22.3 million and $32.8 million at December 31,
    2008 and 2007, respectively.

Contributions

Pension contributions totaled $12.8 million and
    $13.0 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our 2009
    pension contributions are expected to be in the range of
    $40 million to $45 million. The increase in the 2009
    expected contribution relates primarily to the enactment of the
    Pension Protection Act of 2006. The 2009 expected contributions
    will equal or exceed our minimum funding requirements.

Estimated

    plan

We have a 401(k) plan (“the plan”) with an employee
    stock ownership (“ESOP”) bonus component, which covers
    certain union and nearly all non-union U.S. employees who meet
    certain age requirements. Under the plan, eligible U.S.
    employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of their
    eligible compensation. The company matches contributions made by
    employees who meet certain eligibility and service requirements.
    Our matching contribution is 100% of eligible employee
    contributions for the first 1% of eligible compensation, and 50%
    of the next 5% of eligible compensation.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet
    certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP
    contribution equal to 1.5% of annual eligible compensation.

Our combined expense for the plan and ESOP was approximately
    $17.0 million, $11.9 million, and $12.3 million,
    in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively.

Other
    retirement compensation

Total other accrued retirement compensation was
    $13.6 million and $14.4 million in 2008 and 2007,
    respectively, and is included in the pension and other
    retirement compensation line of our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Authorized
    shares

We may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our
    Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those
    shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board
    of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock with
    authorization to issue up to 2.5 million shares,
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
    $0.10 per share. No shares of preferred stock were issued or
    outstanding as of December 31, 2008 or December 31,
    2007.

Purchase
    rights

On December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock.
    The dividend was payable upon the close of business on
    January 28, 2005 to the shareholders of record upon the
    close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right entitles
    the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share
    of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a
    price of $240.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless
    certain change in control events occur, such as a person
    acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership
    of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. The description

Omnibus
    stock incentive plans

In May 2008, the 2008 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended
    and Restated (the “2008 Plan”) was approved by
    shareholders. The 2008 Plan authorizes the issuance of
    additional shares of our common stock and extends through
    February 2018. The 2008 Plan allows for the granting of:

•

nonqualified stock options;

•

incentive stock options;

•

restricted shares;

•

restricted stock units;

•

dividend equivalent units;

•

stock appreciation rights;

•

performance shares;

•

performance units; and

•

other stock based awards.

The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee (the
    “Committee”), which is made up of independent members
    of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards
    under the Plans are managerial, administrative, or other key
    employees who are in a position to make a material contribution
    to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of
    Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the
    recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards,
    establish certain terms and conditions of award grants, and take
    certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan
    restricts the Committee’s authority to reprice awards or to
    cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

Non-qualified
    and incentive stock options

Under the Plan, we may grant stock options to any eligible
    employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally
    vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and
    expire ten years after the grant date. Prior to 2006, option
    grants typically had a reload feature when shares are retired to
    pay the exercise price, allowing individuals to receive
    additional options upon exercise equal to the number of shares
    retired. Option awards granted after 2005 under the 2004 Plan
    and under the 2008 Plan do not have a reload feature attached to
    the option. Annual expense for the value of stock options was
    $10.5 million in 2008, $13.6 million in 2007 and
    $14.3 million in 2006.

Restricted
    shares and restricted stock units

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded restricted shares
    or restricted stock units (awards) of our common stock. Share
    awards generally vest from two to five years after issuance,
    subject to continuous employment and certain other conditions.
    Restricted share awards are valued at market value on the date

of grant and are expensed over the vesting period. Annual
    expense for the value of restricted shares and restricted stock
    units was $10.1 million in 2008, $9.3 million in 2007,
    and $11.1 million in 2006.

Stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares, and performance
    units

Under the Plan, the Committee is permitted to issue these
    awards; however, there have been no issuances of these awards.

Outside
    directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options were granted to outside directors
    under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the
    “Directors Plan”) with an exercise price equal to the
    market value of the shares on the option grant dates. Options
    generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant
    date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors
    Plan expired in January 2008. Prior grants remain outstanding on
    the terms in effect at the time of grant.

Non-employee Directors are also eligible to receive awards under
    the 2008 Plan. Director awards are made by our Governance
    Committee, which is made up of independent members of our Board
    of Directors.

The Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders in
    2004 (the “2004 Plan”) expired upon approval of the
    2008 Plan by shareholders. Prior grants made under the 2004 Plan
    and earlier stock incentive plans remained outstanding on the
    terms in effect at the time of grant.

Business
    Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following
    business segments based primarily on types of products offered
    and markets served:

•

Water

— manufactures and markets
    essential products and systems used in the movement, storage,
    treatment, and enjoyment of water. Water segment products
    include water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification
    components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and
    pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Technical Products

— designs,
    manufactures, and markets standard, modified and custom
    enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and
    electrical components; thermal management products; and
    accessories. Applications served include industrial machinery,
    data communications, networking, telecommunications, test and
    measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense, and general
    electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures,
    cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes, and associated thermal
    management systems.

•

Other

— is primarily composed of
    unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance
    subsidiary, intermediate finance companies, divested operations,
    and intercompany eliminations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and
    operating income of the segments and use a variety of ratios to
    measure performance. These results are not necessarily
    indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred
    had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during
    the periods presented.

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple
    markets and customers for which we do not have the information
    systems to track revenues by primary product category. However,
    our net sales by segment are representative of our sales by
    major product category.

We sell our products through various distribution channels
    including wholesale and retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, and home centers. In our Water segment, one
    customer accounted for just over 10% of segment sales in 2008,
    one customer accounted for just over 11% of segment sales in
    2007 and one customer accounted for just over 10% of segment
    sales in 2006. In our Technical Products segment, no single
    customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in 2008,
    2007, or 2006.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001, and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relate to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2008
    and 2007, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $3.1 million and
    $3.5 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement, and employment matters.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

We comply with the requirements of SFAS No. 5,

Accounting for Contingencies,

and related guidance, and
    record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss contingency
    where the outcome of the matter is probable and can be
    reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel, and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims could change in the future.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald our captive
    insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these
    claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For
    all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on
    an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated based on existing information. The accruals are
    adjusted periodically as additional information becomes
    available. We have not experienced significant unfavorable
    trends in either the severity or frequency of product liability
    lawsuits or personal injury claims.

Horizon
    Litigation

The Horizon litigation against our subsidiary Essef Corporation
    and certain of its subsidiaries by Celebrity Cruise Lines, Inc.
    (“Celebrity”) was settled by payment of
    $35 million to Celebrity in August 2008, a portion of which
    was covered by insurance. As a result of the settlement, we
    recorded a charge of $20.4 million in 2008 which is shown
    on the line

Legal settlement

in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Warranties
    and guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product
    lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various
    potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as
    pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or
    other obligations. The subject matter, amounts, and duration of
    any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of
    liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to
    transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such
    indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the
    overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably
    estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments
    for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur
    a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a
    material effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

In accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 45
    (“FIN 45”),

Guarantor’s Accounting and
    Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
    Guarantees of Others,

we recognize, at the inception of a
    guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation
    undertaken in issuing the guarantee.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products.
    Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a

Stand-by

    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties
    under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, the
    outstanding value of these instruments totaled
    $64.5 million and $58.5 million, respectively.
