Customers

Our Water Group distributes its products through wholesale
    distributors, retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers, home centers and home and pool builders.
    Information regarding significant customers in our



Water Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment follows warm
    weather trends and is at seasonal highs from April to August.
    The magnitude of the sales increase is partially mitigated by
    employing some advance sale “early buy” programs
    (generally including extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Competition

Our Water Group faces numerous domestic and international
    competitors, some of which have substantially greater resources
    directed to the markets in which we compete. Consolidation and
    globalization are continuing trends in the water industry.
    Competition in commercial and residential flow technologies
    markets focuses on brand names, product performance (including
    energy-efficient offerings), quality and price. While home
    center and national retailers are important for residential
    lines of water and wastewater pumps, they are not important for
    commercial pumps. For municipal pumps, competition focuses on
    performance to meet required specifications, service and price.
    Competition in water treatment and filtration components focuses
    on product performance and design, quality, delivery and price.
    For pool equipment, competition focuses on brand names, product
    performance (including energy-efficient offerings), quality and
    price. We compete by offering a wide variety of innovative and
    high-quality products, which are competitively priced. We
    believe our distribution channels and reputation for quality
    also contribute to our continuing market penetration.

TECHNICAL
    PRODUCTS GROUP

Our Technical Products Group is a leader in the global
    enclosures and thermal management markets, designing and
    manufacturing standard, modified and custom enclosures that
    house and protect sensitive electronics and electrical
    components and protect the people that use them. Our Technical
    Products Group focuses its business portfolio on the following
    primary vertical markets: Industrial (35% of Group sales),
    Communications (25% of Group sales), General Electronics (10% of
    Group sales), Energy (10% of Group sales) and Commercial,
    Security and Defense, Infrastructure and Medical (these four
    vertical markets combined represent approximately 20% of Group
    sales). Products include metallic and composite enclosures,
    cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes and associated thermal
    management systems. Applications served include industrial
    machinery, data communications, networking, telecommunications,
    test and measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense and
    general electronics.

Customers

Our Technical Products Group distributes its products through
    electrical and data contractors, electrical and electronic
    components distributors and original equipment manufacturers.
    Information regarding significant customers in our Technical
    Products Group is contained in ITEM 8, Note 15 of the
    Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Seasonality

Our Technical Products Group is not significantly affected by
    seasonal demand fluctuations.

Competition

Competition in the technical products markets can be intense,
    particularly in the Communications market, where product design,
    prototyping, global supply, price competition and customer
    service are significant factors. Our Technical Products Group
    has continued to focus on cost control and improving
    profitability. Recent sales increases in the Technical Products
    Group are the result of market recovery following the global
    recession in 2009. The growth derived from the market recovery
    was complemented by growth from initiatives



focused on product development, continued channel penetration,
    growth in targeted market segments, geographic expansion and
    price increases. Consolidation, globalization and outsourcing
    are visible trends in the technical products marketplace and
    typically play to the strengths of a large and globally
    positioned supplier. We believe our Technical Products Group has
    the global manufacturing capability and broad product portfolio
    to support the globalization and outsourcing trends.

The $91.5 million decrease in Water Group backlog was
    primarily due to reduced backlog related to the Gulf
    Intracoastal Waterway project and other large municipal projects
    for the Engineered Flow global business unit at
    December 31, 2010. The $33.2 million increase in the
    Technical Products Group backlog reflected growth across our
    vertical markets served. Due to the relatively short
    manufacturing cycle and general industry practice for the
    majority of our businesses, backlog, which typically represents
    less than 60 days of shipments, is not deemed to be a
    significant item. A substantial portion of our revenues result
    from orders received and product sold in the same month. We
    expect that most of our backlog at December 31, 2010 will
    be filled in 2011.

Research
    and development

We conduct research and development activities in our own
    facilities, which consist primarily of the development of new
    products, product applications and manufacturing processes.
    Research and development expenditures during 2010, 2009 and 2008
    were $67.2 million, $57.9 million and
    $62.5 million, respectively.

Environmental

Environmental matters are discussed in ITEM 3, ITEM 7
    and in ITEM 8, Note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements, included in this

Form 10-K.

Raw
    materials

The principal materials used in the manufacturing of our
    products are electric motors, mild steel, stainless steel,
    electronic components, plastics (resins, fiberglass, epoxies),
    copper and paint (powder and liquid). In addition to the
    purchase of raw materials, we purchase some finished goods for
    distribution through our sales channels.

The materials used in the various manufacturing processes are
    purchased on the open market and the majority are available
    through multiple sources and are in adequate supply. We have not
    experienced any significant work stoppages to date due to
    shortages of materials. We have certain long-term commitments,
    principally price commitments, for the purchase of various
    component parts and raw materials and believe that it is
    unlikely that any of these agreements would be terminated
    prematurely. Alternate sources of supply at competitive prices
    are available for most materials for which long-term commitments
    exist and we believe that the termination of any of these
    commitments would not have a material adverse effect on
    operations.

Certain commodities, such as metals and resin, are subject to
    market and duty-driven price fluctuations. We manage these
    fluctuations through several mechanisms, including long-term
    agreements with price adjustment clauses for significant
    commodity market movements in certain circumstances. Prices for
    raw materials, such as metals and resins, may trend higher in
    the future.



Intellectual
    property

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names and brand names
    are important to our business. However, we do not regard our
    business as being materially dependent upon any single patent,
    non-compete agreement, proprietary technology, customer
    relationship, trade mark, trade name or brand name.

Patents, patent applications and license agreements will expire
    or terminate over time by operation of law, in accordance with
    their terms or otherwise. We do not expect the termination of
    patents, patent applications or license agreements to have a
    material adverse effect on our financial position, results of
    operations or cash flows.

Employees

As of December 31, 2010, we employed approximately
    14,300 people worldwide. Total employees in the United
    States were approximately 6,900, of whom approximately 475 are
    represented by four different trade unions having collective
    bargaining agreements. Generally, labor relations have been
    satisfactory.

Captive
    Insurance Subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. Accruals with respect to liabilities insured by
    third parties, such as liabilities arising from acquired
    businesses, pre-Penwald liabilities and those of certain foreign
    operations are established.

Matters pertaining to Penwald are discussed in ITEM 3 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Insurance Subsidiary, included in this

ITEM 1A.

RISK
    FACTORS

You should carefully consider the following risk factors and
    warnings before making an investment decision. You are cautioned
    not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements.
    You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or
    identify all such factors and should not consider the following
    list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and
    uncertainties. If any of the risks described below actually
    occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations
    or prospects could be materially adversely affected. In that
    case, the price of our securities could decline and you could
    lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to
    other information set forth in this document.

General
    economic conditions, including difficult credit and residential
    construction markets, affect demand for our
    products.

We compete around the world in various geographic regions and
    product markets. Among these, the most significant are global
    industrial markets (for both the Technical Products and Water
    Groups) and residential markets (for the Water Group). Important
    factors for our businesses include the overall strength of the
    economy and our customers’ confidence in the economy;
    industrial and governmental capital spending; the strength of
    the residential and commercial real estate markets; unemployment
    rates; availability of consumer and commercial financing for our
    customers and end-users; and interest rates. New construction
    for residential



housing and home improvement activity fell in 2007, 2008 and
    2009, which reduced revenue growth in the residential businesses
    within our Water Group. While we saw some stabilization in 2010,
    we believe that weakness in this market could negatively impact
    our revenues and margins in future periods. Further, while we
    attempt to minimize our exposure to economic or market
    fluctuations by serving a balanced mix of end markets and
    geographic regions, we cannot assure you that a significant or
    sustained downturn in a specific end market or geographic region
    would not have a material adverse effect on us.

Our
    inability to sustain organic growth could adversely affect our
    financial performance.

Over the past five years, our organic growth has been generated
    in part from expanding international sales, entering new
    distribution channels, introducing new products and price
    increases. To grow more rapidly than our end markets, we would
    have to continue to expand our geographic reach, further
    diversify our distribution channels, continue to introduce new
    products and increase sales of existing products to our customer
    base. Difficult economic and competitive factors materially and
    adversely impacted our financial performance in 2009. These
    conditions started to improve in many of our end markets in
    2010, but we cannot assure you that these markets will continue
    to improve nor that we will be able to increase revenues and
    profitability to match our earlier financial performance. We
    have chosen to focus our growth initiatives in specific end
    markets and geographies. We cannot assure you that these growth
    initiatives will be sufficient to offset revenue declines in
    other markets.

Our
    businesses operate in highly competitive markets, so we may be
    forced to cut prices or to incur additional costs.

Our businesses generally face substantial competition in each of
    their respective markets. Competition may force us to cut prices
    or to incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete
    on the basis of product design, quality, availability,
    performance, customer service and price. Present or future
    competitors may have greater financial, technical or other
    resources which could put us at a disadvantage in the affected
    business or businesses. We cannot assure you that these and
    other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our
    future results of operations.

Material
    cost and other inflation have adversely affected and could
    continue to affect our results of operations.

In the past, we have experienced material cost and other
    inflation in a number of our businesses. We strive for
    productivity improvements and implement increases in selling
    prices to help mitigate cost increases in raw materials
    (especially metals and resins), energy and other costs such as
    pension, health care and insurance. We continue to implement our
    excellence in operations initiatives in order to mitigate the
    impacts of this inflation and continuously reduce our costs. We
    cannot assure you, however, that these actions will be
    successful in managing our costs or increasing our productivity.
    Continued cost inflation or failure of our initiatives to
    generate cost savings or improve productivity would likely
    negatively impact our results of operations.

Seasonality
    of sales and weather conditions may adversely affect our
    financial results.

We experience seasonal demand in a number of markets within our
    Water Group. End-user demand for pool equipment in our primary
    markets follows warm weather trends and is at seasonal highs
    from April to August. The magnitude of the sales increase is
    partially mitigated by employing some advance sale or
    “early buy” programs (generally including extended
    payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts. We cannot assure you that
    seasonality and weather conditions will not have a material
    adverse effect on our results of operations.

Intellectual
    property challenges may hinder product development and
    marketing.

Patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary technologies,
    customer relationships, trade marks, trade names and brand names
    are important to our business. Intellectual property protection,
    however, may not preclude



competitors from developing products similar to ours or from
    challenging our names or products. Over the past few years, we
    have noticed an increasing tendency for participants in our
    markets to use conflicts over and challenges to intellectual
    property as a means to compete. Patent and trademark challenges
    increase our costs to develop, engineer and market our products.

Our
    results of operations may be negatively impacted by
    litigation.

Our businesses expose us to potential litigation, such as
    product liability claims relating to the design, manufacture and
    sale of our products. While we currently maintain what we
    believe to be suitable product liability insurance, we cannot
    assure you that we will be able to maintain this insurance on
    acceptable terms or that this insurance will provide adequate
    protection against potential liabilities. In addition, we
    self-insure a portion of product liability claims. A series of
    successful claims against us for significant amounts could
    materially and adversely affect our product reputation,
    financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.

We may
    not be able to expand through acquisitions and acquisitions we
    complete may adversely affect our financial
    performance.

We intend to continue to evaluate strategic acquisitions
    primarily in our current business segments, though we may
    consider acquisitions outside of these segments as well. Our
    ability to expand through acquisitions is subject to various
    risks, including the following:

•

Higher acquisition prices;

•

Lack of suitable acquisition candidates in targeted product or
    market areas;

•

Increased competition for acquisitions, especially in the water
    industry;

•

Inability to integrate acquired businesses effectively or
    profitably; and

•

Inability to achieve anticipated synergies or other benefits
    from acquisitions.

Acquisitions we may undertake could have a material adverse
    effect on our operating results, particularly in the fiscal
    quarters immediately following the acquisitions, while we
    attempt to integrate operations of the acquired businesses into
    our operations. Once integrated, acquired operations may not
    achieve the levels of financial performance originally
    anticipated.

The
    availability and cost of capital could have a negative impact on
    our financial performance.

Our plans to vigorously compete in our chosen markets will
    require additional capital for future acquisitions, capital
    expenditures, growth of working capital and continued
    international and regional expansion. In the past, we have
    financed growth of our businesses primarily through cash from
    operations and debt financing. While we refinanced our primary
    credit agreements in 2007 on what we believe to be favorable
    terms, future acquisitions or other uses of funds may require us
    to expand our debt financing resources or to issue equity
    securities. Our financial results may be adversely affected if
    new financing is not available on favorable terms or if interest
    costs under our debt financings are higher than the income
    generated by acquisitions or other internal growth. In addition,
    future share issuances could be dilutive to your equity
    investment if we sell shares into the market or issue additional
    stock as consideration in any acquisition. We cannot assure you
    that we will be able to issue equity securities or obtain future
    debt financing at favorable terms. Without sufficient financing,
    we will not be able to pursue our targeted growth strategy and
    our acquisition program, which may limit our revenue growth and
    future financial performance.

We are
    exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from
    operating a multinational business.

Sales outside of the United States, including export sales from
    our domestic businesses, accounted for approximately 34% of our
    net sales in both 2010 and 2009. Further, most of our businesses
    obtain some



products, components and raw materials from foreign suppliers.
    Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic
    and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous
    countries. These risks include:

•

changes in general economic and political conditions in
    countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets;

•

relatively more severe economic conditions in some international
    markets than in the United States;

•

the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting
    receivables through foreign legal systems;

•

trade protection measures and import or export licensing
    requirements;

•

the possibility of terrorist action against us or our operations;

•

the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other trade
    restrictions;

•

difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations in

non-U.S. labor

markets;

•

changes in tax laws or rulings could have an adverse impact on
    our effective tax rate;

•

the difficulty of protecting intellectual property in foreign
    countries; and

•

required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and
    regulations.

Our business success depends in part on our ability to
    anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We
    cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a
    material adverse effect on our international operations or on
    our business as a whole.

Our
    international operations are subject to foreign market and
    currency fluctuation risks.

We expect the percentage of our sales outside of the United
    States to increase in the future. Over the past few years, the
    economies of some of the foreign countries in which we do
    business have had slower growth than the U.S. economy. The
    European Union currently accounts for the majority of our
    foreign sales and income, in which our most significant European
    market is Germany. In addition, we have a significant and
    growing business in the Asia-Pacific region, but the economic
    conditions in countries in this region are subject to different
    growth expectations, market weaknesses and business practices.
    We cannot predict how changing market conditions in these
    regions will impact our financial results.

We are also exposed to the risk of fluctuation of foreign
    currency exchange rates which may affect our financial results
    as we manufacture and source certain products, components and
    raw materials throughout the world.

We
    have significant goodwill and intangible assets and future
    impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets could have a
    material negative impact on our financial results.

We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for
    impairment on an annual basis, by comparing the estimated fair
    value of each of our reporting units to their respective
    carrying values on their balance sheets. At December 31,
    2010 our goodwill and intangible assets were approximately
    $2,519.6 million and represented approximately 63.4% of our
    total assets. Long-term declines in projected future cash flows
    could result in future goodwill and intangible asset
    impairments. Because of the significance of our goodwill and
    intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

We are
    exposed to potential environmental and other laws, liabilities
    and litigation.

We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and
    regulations governing our environmental practices, public and
    worker health and safety and the indoor and outdoor environment.
    Compliance with these environmental, health and safety
    regulations could require us to satisfy environmental
    liabilities, increase the cost of manufacturing our products or
    otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition and
    results of operations. Any violations of these laws by us could
    cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities that could



harm our operating results and cause our business to suffer. We
    are also required to comply with various environmental laws and
    maintain permits, some of which are subject to discretionary
    renewal from time to time, for many of our businesses and we
    could suffer if we are unable to renew existing permits or to
    obtain any additional permits that we may require.

We have been named as defendants, targets or potentially
    responsible parties (“PRP”) in a number of
    environmental

clean-ups

relating to our current or former business units. We have
    disposed of a number of businesses in recent years and in
    certain cases, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from certain purchasers. We
    may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future for existing
    business units, as well as both divested and acquired businesses.

We cannot ensure you that environmental requirements will not
    change or become more stringent over time or that our eventual
    environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

We are
    exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to
    climate change.

Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide.
    Many scientists, legislators and others attribute global warming
    to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon
    dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory
    efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The
    U.S. Congress and federal and state regulatory agencies
    have been considering legislation and regulatory proposals that
    would regulate and limit greenhouse gas emissions. It is
    uncertain whether, when and in what form a federal mandatory
    carbon dioxide emissions reduction program may be adopted.
    Similarly, certain countries have adopted the Kyoto Protocol and
    this and other international initiatives under consideration
    could affect our international operations. These actions could
    increase costs associated with our operations, including costs
    for raw materials and transportation. Because it is uncertain
    what laws will be enacted, we cannot predict the potential
    impact of such laws on our future consolidated financial
    condition, results of operations or cash flows.

Provisions
    of our Restated Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Minnesota
    law could deter takeover attempts.

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under
    Minnesota law and in our shareholder rights plan could prevent
    or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.

Our Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws include
    provisions relating to the election, appointment and removal of
    directors, as well as shareholder notice and shareholder voting
    requirements which could delay, prevent or make more difficult a
    merger, tender offer, proxy contest or other change of control.
    In addition, our common share purchase rights could cause
    substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to
    acquire us, which could deter some acquirers from making
    takeover proposals or tender offers. Also, the Minnesota
    Business Corporations Act contains control share acquisition and
    business combination provisions which could delay, prevent or
    make more difficult a merger, tender offer, proxy contest or
    other change of control. Our shareholders might view any such
    transaction as being in their best interests since the
    transaction could result in a higher stock price than the
    current market price for our common stock.

ITEM 2.

PROPERTIES

Our principal executive office is in leased premises located in
    Golden Valley, Minnesota. We carry out our Water Group
    manufacturing operations at 26 plants located throughout the
    United States and at 14 plants located in 10 other countries. In
    addition, our Water Group has 19 distribution facilities and 35
    sales offices located in numerous countries throughout the
    world. We carry out our Technical Products Group manufacturing
    operations at 6 plants located throughout the United States and
    10 plants located in 8 other countries. In



addition, our Technical Products Group has 9 distribution
    facilities and 26 sales offices located in numerous countries
    throughout the world.

We believe that our production facilities are suitable for their
    purpose and are adequate to support our businesses.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL
    PROCEEDINGS

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement and employment matters.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims described in “Legal
    Proceedings” could change in the future.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in the past years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at
    the sites. We have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for remediation costs at these sites. We do not believe
    that projected response costs will result in a material
    liability. We have also made claims against third parties for
    indemnification against potential liabilities for environmental
    remediations or other obligations. We cannot assure you that we
    will be successful in obtaining indemnity or reimbursement for
    such costs.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States. As of December 31, 2010
    and 2009, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $1.3 million and
    $2.3 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. See discussion in ITEM 1 and
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements — Insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a
    liability for these claims based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. For all other claims, accruals covering the
    claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is
    probable that a liability



has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be
    reasonably estimated based on existing information. The accruals
    are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes
    available. In 2004, we disposed of the Tools Group and we
    retained responsibility for certain product claims. We have not
    experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the
    severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal
    injury claims.

Stock
    Performance Graph

The following information under the caption “Stock
    Performance Graph” in this ITEM 5 of this Annual
    Report on

Form 10-K

is not deemed to be “soliciting material” or to be
    “filed” with the SEC or subject to Regulation 14A
    or 14C under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or to the
    liabilities of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of
    1934 and will not be deemed to be incorporated by reference into
    any filing under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities
    Exchange Act of 1934, except to the extent we specifically
    incorporate it by reference into such a filing.

The following graph sets forth the cumulative total shareholder
    return on our common stock for the last five years, assuming the
    investment of $100 on December 31, 2005 and the
    reinvestment of all dividends since that date to
    December 31, 2010. The graph also contains for comparison
    purposes the S&P 500 Index and the S&P MidCap 400
    Index, assuming the same investment level and reinvestment of
    dividends.

By virtue of our market capitalization, we are a component of
    the S&P MidCap 400 Index. On the basis of our size and
    diversity of businesses, we have not found a readily
    identifiable peer group. We believe the S&P MidCap 400
    Index is an appropriate comparison. We have evaluated other
    published indices, but have determined that the results are
    skewed by significantly larger companies included in the
    indices. We believe such a comparison would not be meaningful.

In February and April 2007, we acquired the outstanding shares
    of capital stock of Jung Pump and all of the capital interests
    of Porous Media, respectively, as part of our Water Group. In
    May 2007, we acquired as part of our Technical Products Group
    the assets of Calmark. In June 2008, we entered into a
    transaction with GE that was accounted for as an acquisition of
    an 80.1 percent ownership interest in GE’s global

Overview

We are a focused diversified industrial manufacturing company
    comprised of two operating segments: Water and Technical
    Products. Our Water Group is a global leader in providing
    innovative products and systems used worldwide in the movement,
    storage, treatment and enjoyment of water. Our Technical
    Products Group is a leader in the global enclosures and thermal
    management markets, designing and manufacturing standard,
    modified and custom enclosures that house and protect sensitive
    electronics and electrical components and protect the people
    that use them. In 2010, our Water Group and Technical Products
    Group accounted for approximately 2/3 and 1/3 of total revenues,
    respectively.

Our Water Group has progressively become a more important part
    of our business portfolio with sales increasing from
    approximately $125 million in 1995 to approximately
    $2.0 billion in 2010. We believe the water industry is
    structurally attractive as a result of a growing demand for
    clean water and the large global market size. Our vision is to
    be a leading global provider of innovative products and systems
    used in the movement, storage, treatment and enjoyment of water.

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 80.1 percent
    ownership interest in GE’s global water softener and
    residential water filtration business in exchange for a
    19.9 percent interest in our global water softener and
    residential water filtration business. The acquisition was
    effected through the formation of two new entities,
    (collectively, “Pentair Residential Filtration” or
    “PRF”) a U.S. entity and an international entity,
    into which we and GE contributed certain assets, properties,
    liabilities and operations representing our respective global
    water softener and residential water filtration businesses. We
    are an 80.1 percent owner of the new entities and GE is a
    19.9 percent owner.

With the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration, we believe
    we are better positioned to serve residential customers with
    industry-leading technical applications in the areas of water
    conditioning, whole house and point of use filtration.

Our Technical Products Group operates in a large global market
    with significant potential for growth in industry segments such
    as data communications, industrial, infrastructure and energy.
    We believe we have the largest industrial and commercial
    distribution network in North America for enclosures and the
    highest brand recognition in the industry in North America.

Key
    Trends and Uncertainties

Our sales revenue for the full year of 2010 was approximately
    $3.0 billion, increasing 13% from sales in the prior year.
    Our Water Group sales increased 10% in the year to approximately
    $2.0 billion, compared to the same period in 2009. Our
    Technical Products Group sales increased 17% to approximately
    $1.0 billion as compared to the same period in 2009.



The following trends and uncertainties affected our financial
    performance in 2010 and will likely impact our results in the
    future:

•

Most markets we serve slowed dramatically in late 2008 and
    throughout 2009 as a result of the global recession. In 2010,
    most markets showed signs of improvement. Because our businesses
    are significantly affected by general economic trends, further
    deterioration in our most important markets addressed below
    would likely have an adverse impact on our results of operation
    for 2011 and beyond.

•

We have also identified specific market opportunities that we
    have been and are pursuing that we find attractive, both within
    and outside the United States. We are reinforcing our businesses
    to more effectively address these opportunities through research
    and development and additional sales and marketing resources.
    Unless we successfully penetrate these product and geographic
    markets, our organic growth will be limited.

•

After four years of new home building and new pool start
    contraction in the United States, these end markets stabilized
    in 2010. Overall, we believe approximately 40% of Pentair sales
    are used in global residential applications — for
    replacement and refurbishment, remodeling and repair and new
    construction. We expect this stabilization, along with new
    product introductions and expanded distribution and channel
    penetration, to result in volume increases in 2011. We believe
    that housing construction will modestly improve in 2011, which
    we expect will have a favorable impact on these businesses, but
    our participation in this trend historically has lagged
    approximately six months from inception.

•

Industrial, communications and commercial markets for all of our
    businesses, including commercial and industrial construction,
    also slowed significantly in 2009. Order rates and sales
    improved in our industrial and communications businesses in 2010
    as business spending returned, while non-residential
    construction markets still declined. We believe that the outlook
    for most of these markets is mixed and we currently expect that
    non-residential construction declines will moderate to
    approximately down 5% year over year in 2011, compared to a
    decline of approximately 10% in 2010.

•

Through 2010, we experienced material and other cost inflation.
    We strive for productivity improvements, and we implement
    increases in selling prices to mitigate this inflation. We
    expect the current economic environment will result in
    continuing price volatility for many of our raw materials. We
    believe that the impact of higher commodity prices will continue
    to impact us in 2011, but we are uncertain on the timing and
    impact of this cost inflation.

•

Despite higher interest expense and lower discount rates, our
    unfunded pension liabilities declined to approximately
    $201 million as of the end of 2010 due to investment
    performance and plan contributions. The contributions included
    accelerated contributions of $25 million in December 2009
    and 2010, respectively, to improve plan balances and reduce
    future contributions. We anticipate that our pension expense
    will increase over 2010 levels.

•

We have a long-term goal to consistently generate free cash flow
    that equals or exceeds 100 percent of our net income. We
    define free cash flow as cash flow from continuing operating
    activities less capital expenditures plus proceeds from sale of
    property and equipment. Free cash flow for the full year 2010
    was approximately $211 million, or 106% of our net income;
    which included an accelerated contribution to our pension plan
    of $25 million in December 2010. We continue to expect to
    generate free cash flow in excess of net income from continuing
    operations in 2011. We are continuing to target reductions in
    working capital and particularly inventory, as a percentage of
    sales. See our discussion of

Other financial measures

under the caption “Liquidity and Capital
    Resources” in this report for a reconciliation of our free
    cash flow.

In 2011, our operating objectives include the following:

•

Increasing our presence in fast growth regions and vertical
    market focus to grow in those markets in which we have
    competitive advantages;

•

Leveraging our technological capabilities to increasingly
    generate innovative new products;



•

Driving operating excellence through lean enterprise
    initiatives, with specific focus on sourcing and supply
    management, cash flow management and lean operations; and

•

Focusing on proactive talent development, particularly in
    international management and other key functional areas.

We may seek to meet our objectives of expanding our geographic
    reach internationally, expanding our presence in our various
    channels to market and acquiring technologies and products to
    broaden our businesses’ capabilities to serve additional
    markets though acquisitions. We may also consider the
    divestiture of discrete business units to further focus our
    businesses on their most attractive markets.

Consolidated
    net sales

The
    12.6 percentage point increase in consolidated net sales in
    2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by:

•

higher sales volume in the Technical Products Group;

•

higher sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the stabilization in the North American
    residential housing markets and other global markets following
    the global recession in 2009; and

•

increased sales resulting from the Gulf Intracoastal Waterway
    Project.

The 19.7 percentage point decrease in consolidated net
    sales in 2009 from 2008 was primarily the result of:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the downturn in the North American and
    Western European residential housing markets and other global
    markets;

•

lower Technical Products Group sales in both the Electrical and
    Electronics businesses; and

•

unfavorable foreign currency effects.

These decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases; and

•

an increase in sales volume related to the formation of PRF.

Water
    Group

The
    10.5 percentage point increase in Water Group net sales in
    2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by:

•

organic sales growth of approximately 10.3 percent in 2010
    (excluding foreign currency exchange) primarily due to higher
    sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products primarily
    related to the stabilization in the North American residential
    housing markets and other global markets following the global
    recession in 2009 primarily related to:

• increased sales resulting from the Gulf Intracoastal
    Waterway Project;

•

continued sales growth in India, China and in other emerging
    markets in the Asia-Pacific region as well as Latin
    America; and

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

price concessions in the form of growth rebates.

The
    16.2 percentage point decrease in Water Group sales in 2009
    from 2008 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales decline (excluding acquisitions and foreign
    currency exchange) of 16.1 percent primarily due to lower
    sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products primarily
    related to the downturn in the North American and Western
    European residential housing markets and other global
    markets; and

•

unfavorable foreign currency effects.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases; and

•

an increase in sales volume due to the formation of PRF.

Technical
    Products Group

The
    17.1 percentage point increase in Technical Products Group
    net sales in 2010 from 2009 was primarily driven by:

•

organic sales growth of approximately 17.7 percent in 2010
    (excluding foreign currency exchange) primarily related to:

•

an increase in sales in industrial, general electronics,
    communications, energy and infrastructure vertical
    markets; and

• selective increases in selling prices to mitigate
    inflationary cost increases.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

unfavorable foreign currency effects in 2010 primarily related
    to the euro.

The
    26.3 percentage point decrease in Technical Products Group
    sales in 2009 from 2008 was primarily the result of:

•

organic sales decline (excluding foreign currency exchange) of
    25.4 percent primarily related to:

•

a decrease in sales to electrical markets resulting from lower
    capital spending by customers in the industrial vertical market;

•

a decrease in sales to electronics markets that was largely
    attributable to reduced spending in the communications and
    general electronics vertical markets; and



•

unfavorable foreign currency effects.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

selective increases in selling prices to mitigate inflationary
    cost increases.

The
    1.5 percentage point increase in gross profit as a
    percentage of sales in 2010 from 2009 was primarily the result
    of:

•

higher sales volumes in our Water and Technical Products Groups
    and higher fixed cost absorption resulting from that volume;

•

cost savings from restructuring actions and other personnel
    reductions taken in response to the economic downturn and
    resulting volume decline in 2009; and

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives including lean and
    supply management practices across both the Water and Technical
    Products Groups.

These
    increases were partially offset by:

•

inflationary increases related to certain raw materials and
    labor and related costs.

The
    1.1 percentage point decrease in gross profit as a percent
    of sales in 2009 from 2008 was primarily the result
    of:

•

lower sales of certain pump, pool and filtration products
    primarily related to the downturn in the North American and
    Western European residential housing markets and other global
    market downturns;

•

lower sales volume in our Technical Products Group and lower
    fixed cost absorption resulting from that volume decline;

•

inflationary increases related to raw materials and labor
    costs; and

•

period restructuring costs and write-offs of inventory
    associated with the consolidation of facilities.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

cost savings from restructuring actions and other personnel
    reductions taken in response to the current economic downturn
    and resulting volume decline;

•

selective increases in selling prices in our Water and Technical
    Products Groups to mitigate inflationary cost increases;

•

savings generated from our PIMS initiatives, including lean and
    supply management practices; and

•

higher cost of goods sold in 2008 as a result of a fair market

The
    1.3 percentage point decrease in SG&A expense as a
    percentage of sales in 2010 from 2009 was primarily due
    to:

•

higher sales volume in both our Water and Technical Products
    Groups, which resulted in increased leverage on the fixed
    operating expenses;

•

reduced costs related to restructuring actions taken throughout
    2009 to consolidate facilities and streamline general and

•

impairment charge of $11.3 million in 2009 for selected
    trade names resulting from volume declines; and

•

insurance proceeds related to the Horizon litigation and other
    legal settlements received in 2010.

These
    decreases were partially offset by:

•

continued investments in future growth with emphasis on growth
    in international markets, including personnel and business
    infrastructure investments; and

•

certain increases for labor and related costs as well as
    reinstatement of certain employee benefits.

The
    0.1 percentage point increase in SG&A expense as a
    percent of sales in 2009 from 2008 was primarily the result
    of:

•

lower sales volume and the resultant loss of leverage on the
    SG&A expense spending;

•

expense associated with incremental restructuring actions in
    both our Water and Technical Products Groups in 2009;

•

impairment charge of $11.3 million for selected trade names
    resulting from significant volume declines;

•

higher costs associated with the integration of and intangible
    amortization related to the June 2008 formation of PRF; and

•

continued investments in future growth with emphasis on growth
    in international markets, including personnel and business
    infrastructure investments.

These
    increases were offset by:

•

2008 charges for the Horizon legal settlement, which were
    non-recurring in 2009; and

•

reduced costs related to productivity actions taken throughout
    2008 and 2009 to consolidate facilities and streamline general
    and administrative costs.

the favorable impact of lower debt levels in 2010 as compared to
    2009 in addition to the redemption on April 15, 2009 of our
    7.85% Senior Notes due 2009 (the “Notes”).



The
    30.8 percentage point decrease in interest expense in 2009
    from 2008 was primarily the result of:

•

favorable impact of lower variable interest rates and lower debt
    levels in part attributable to the redemption on April 15,
    2009 of the Notes.

Gain
    on sale of interest in subsidiaries

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    that was accounted for as an acquisition of an 80.1 percent
    ownership interest in GE’s global water softener and
    residential water filtration business in exchange for a
    19.9 percent interest in our global water softener and
    residential water filtration business. The acquisition was
    effected through the formation of two new entities, a
    U.S. entity and an international entity into which we and
    GE contributed certain assets, properties, liabilities and
    operations representing our respective global water softener and
    residential water filtration businesses. We are an
    80.1 percent owner of the new entities and GE is a
    19.9 percent owner. The acquisition and related sale of our
    19.9 percent interest resulted in a gain of
    $109.6 million representing the difference between the
    carrying amount and the fair value of the 19.9 percent
    interest sold.

Loss
    on early extinguishment of debt

On July 8, 2008, we commenced a cash tender offer for all
    of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal of the
    Notes. Upon expiration of the tender offer on August 4,
    2008, we purchased $116.1 million aggregate principal
    amount of the Notes. As a result of this transaction, we
    recognized a loss of $4.6 million on early extinguishment
    of debt in 2008. The loss included the write off of
    $0.1 million in unamortized deferred financing fees in
    addition to recognition of $0.6 million in previously
    unrecognized swap gains and cash paid of $5.1 million
    related to the tender premium and other costs associated with
    the purchase.

On March 16, 2009, we announced the redemption of all of
    our remaining outstanding $133.9 million aggregate
    principal of Notes. The Notes were redeemed on April 15,
    2009 at a redemption price of $1,035.88 per $1,000 of principal
    outstanding plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of this
    transaction, we recognized a loss of $4.8 million on early
    extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2009. The loss
    included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized
    deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of
    $0.3 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash
    paid of $5.0 million related to the redemption and other
    costs associated with the purchase.

The

•

the mix of global earnings.

The
    3.2 percentage point increase in the tax rate in 2009 from
    2008 was primarily the result of:

•

a portion of the gain on the formation of PRF in 2008 being
    taxed at a rate of 0%.

This
    increase was partially offset by:

•

favorable adjustments in 2009 related to prior years’ tax
    returns.

We expect our full year effective tax rate in 2011 to be between
    32% and 32.5%. We will continue to pursue tax rate reduction
    opportunities.



LIQUIDITY
    AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

We generally fund cash requirements for working capital, capital
    expenditures, equity investments, acquisitions, debt repayments,
    dividend payments and share repurchases from cash generated from
    operations, availability under existing committed revolving
    credit facilities and in certain instances, public and private
    debt and equity offerings. We have grown our businesses in
    significant part in the past through acquisitions financed by
    credit provided under our revolving credit facilities and from
    time to time, by private or public debt issuance. Our primary
    revolving credit facilities have generally been adequate for
    these purposes, although we have negotiated additional credit
    facilities as needed to allow us to complete acquisitions; these
    are temporary loans that have in the past been repaid within
    less than a year.

We are focusing on increasing our cash flow and repaying
    existing debt, while continuing to fund our research and
    development, marketing and capital investment initiatives. Our
    intent is to maintain investment grade ratings and a solid
    liquidity position.

Our current $800 million multi-currency revolving credit
    facility (the “Credit Facility”) expires on
    June 4, 2012. The agent banks under the Credit Facility are
    J.P. Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, U.S. Bank
    and Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi. We believe we have ample borrowing
    capacity for our currently projected operating needs. Our
    availability under the Credit Facility was $702.5 million
    at December 31, 2010, which was not limited by any of the
    credit agreement’s financial covenants as of that date.

We experience seasonal cash flows primarily due to seasonal
    demand in a number of markets within our Water Group. We
    generally borrow in the first quarter of our fiscal year for
    operational purposes, which usage reverses in the second quarter
    as the seasonality of our businesses peaks. End-user demand for
    pool and certain pumping equipment follows warm weather trends
    and is at seasonal highs from April to August. The magnitude of
    the sales spike is partially mitigated by employing some advance
    sale “early buy” programs (generally including
    extended payment terms

and/or

additional discounts). Demand for residential and agricultural
    water systems is also impacted by weather patterns, particularly
    by heavy flooding and droughts.

Operating
    activities

Cash provided by operating activities was $270.4 million in
    2010 or $12.0 million higher than in 2009. The increase in
    cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to
    higher income from continuing operations offset by increased
    working capital necessary to support revenue growth.

Cash provided by operating activities was $258.4 million in
    2009 or $54.2 million higher than in 2008. The increase in
    cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to a
    reduction in working capital, offset by an accelerated pension
    contribution of $25 million and lower income from
    continuing operations.

In December 2008, we sold approximately $44 million of a
    customer’s account receivable to a third-party financial
    institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk.
    Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of
    accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
    proceeds are included in the cash flows from operating
    activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2008
    we incurred a loss in the amount of $0.5 million related to
    the sale of accounts receivable which is included in the line
    item

Other

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
    We did not undertake a similar sale of customer receivables in
    2009 or 2010.

Investing
    activities

Capital expenditures in 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    $59.5 million, $54.1 million and $53.1 million,
    respectively. We anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal 2011
    to be approximately $60 to $65 million, primarily for
    capacity expansions in our low cost country manufacturing
    facilities, new product development and general maintenance
    capital.

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa and Bath
    (“Spa/Bath”) business to Balboa Water Group in a cash
    transaction for $9.2 million. The results of Spa/Bath have
    been reported as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented.



On February 28, 2008, we sold our National Pool Tile
    (“NPT”) business to Pool Corporation in a cash
    transaction for $29.8 million. The results of NPT have been
    reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.

Cash proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of
    $0.4 million in 2010 and $1.2 million in 2009 was
    primarily related to various asset dispositions. Cash proceeds
    from the sale of property and equipment of $4.7 million in
    2008 was primarily related to the sale of a facility in our
    Water Group.

Financing
    activities

Net cash used for financing activities was $190.6 in 2010,
    $209.1 million in 2009 and $217.2 in 2008. The decrease
    primarily relates to fluctuations in liquidity. Financing
    activities included draw downs and repayments on our revolving
    credit facilities to fund our operations in the normal course of
    business, payments of dividends, cash received/used for stock
    issued to employees, repurchase of common stock and tax benefits
    related to stock-based compensation.

The Credit Facility creates an unsecured, committed revolving
    credit facility of up to $800 million, with multi-currency
    sub facilities to support investments outside the
    U.S. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at
    the rate of LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest rates and fees on the
    Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings. We believe
    that internally generated funds and funds available under our
    Credit Facility will be sufficient to support our normal
    operations, dividend payments, stock repurchases and debt
    maturities over the life of the Credit Facility.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. Our
    use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the
    relative interest rates for our commercial paper compared to the
    cost of borrowing under our Credit Facility. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 we had no outstanding commercial
    paper.

Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the
    most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total
    consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated
    earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
    (“EBITDA”), as defined) that may not exceed 3.5 to
    1.0. We were in compliance with all covenants under our debt
    agreements as of December 31, 2010.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $40.0 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had
    $4.8 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2010.

Our current credit ratings are as follows:

Long-Term Debt

Current Rating

Rating Agency

Rating

Outlook

Standard & Poor’s

BBB-

Stable

Moody’s

Baa3

Stable

Our long-term debt rating is an investment grade rating.
    Investment grade is a credit rating of BBB- or higher by
    Standard & Poor’s or Baa3 or higher by
    Moody’s.

On March 28, 2010, Standard & Poor’s
    (“S&P”) affirmed our BBB- rating with a stable
    outlook. On April 6, 2010, Moody’s affirmed our Baa3
    rating and changed our current rating outlook from negative to
    stable.

A credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of
    an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation, a
    specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial
    program. The credit rating takes into consideration the
    creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of
    credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the
    currency in which the obligation is denominated. The ratings
    outlook also highlights the potential direction of a short or
    long-term rating. It focuses on identifiable events and
    short-term trends that cause ratings to be placed under
    observation by the respective rating agencies. A change in
    rating outlook does not mean a rating change is inevitable.
    Prior changes in our ratings outlook have had no immediate
    impact on our liquidity exposure or on our cost of debt. We
    believe the potential impact of a downgrade in our financial
    outlook is currently not material to our liquidity exposure or
    cost of debt.



We issue short-term commercial paper notes that are currently
    not rated by Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s.
    Even though our short-term commercial paper is unrated, we
    believe a downgrade in our long-term debt rating could have a
    negative impact on our ability to continue to issue unrated
    commercial paper.

We do not expect that a one rating downgrade of our long-term
    debt by either Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s
    would substantially affect our ability to access the long-term
    debt capital markets. However, depending upon market conditions,
    the amount, timing and pricing of new borrowings could be
    adversely affected. If both of our long-term debt ratings were
    downgraded to below BBB-/Baa3, our flexibility to access the
    term debt capital markets would be reduced.

We expect to continue to have cash requirements to support
    working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest
    and service debt and to pay dividends to shareholders annually.
    We have the ability and sufficient capacity to meet these cash
    requirements, by using available cash and internally generated
    funds and to borrow under our committed and uncommitted credit
    facilities.

We paid dividends in 2010 of $75.5 million, compared with
    $70.9 million in 2009 and $67.3 million in 2008. We
    recently announced an increase in our dividend rate for 2011
    from $0.76 per share in 2010 to $0.80 per share in 2011, which
    is the 35th consecutive year in which we have increased our
    dividend.

In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a
    maximum dollar limit of $50 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had purchased 1,549,893 shares
    for $50 million pursuant to this authorization. This
    authorization expired on December 31, 2008. No
    authorization for the repurchase of shares of our common stock
    was sought from or granted by our Board for 2009. On
    July 27, 2010 the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum dollar
    limit of $25 million. As of December 31, 2010 we had
    repurchased 734,603 shares for $25 million pursuant to
    this plan. In December 2010, the Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a maximum
    dollar limit of $25 million. The authorization expires
    December 2011.

In addition to the summary of significant contractual
    obligations, we will incur annual interest expense on
    outstanding variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2010,
    variable interest rate debt, including the effects of derivative
    financial instruments, was $102.4 million at a weighted
    average interest rate of 1.05%.

The estimated annual pension plan contribution amounts are
    intended to achieve fully funded status of our domestic
    qualified pension plan in accordance with the Pension Protection
    Act of 2006.

Pension and post retirement plan contributions are based on an
    assumed discount rate of 5.9% for all periods and an expected
    rate of return on plan assets ranging from 6.0% to 8.0%. In
    December 2010 and 2009 we made accelerated contributions of
    $25 million to our defined benefit pension plan.



The total gross liability for uncertain tax positions at
    December 31, 2010 is estimated to be approximately
    $24.3 million. We record penalties and interest related to
    unrecognized tax benefits in

Provision for income taxes

and

Interest expense

, respectively, which is
    consistent with our past practices. As of December 31,
    2010, we had recorded approximately $0.8 million for the
    possible payment of penalties and $4.8 million related to
    the possible payment of interest.

Other
    financial measures

In addition to measuring our cash flow generation or usage based
    upon operating, investing and financing classifications included
    in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we also measure
    our free cash flow. We have a long-term goal to consistently
    generate free cash flow that equals or exceeds 100% conversion
    of net income from continuing operations. Free cash flow is a
    non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles financial measure
    that we use to assess our cash flow performance. We believe free
    cash flow is an important measure of operating performance
    because they provide us and our investors a measurement of cash
    generated from operations that is available to pay dividends,
    make acquisitions, repay debt and repurchase shares. In
    addition, free cash flow is used as a criterion to measure and
    pay compensation-based incentives. Our measure of free cash flow
    may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by
    other companies. The following table is a reconciliation of free
    cash flow:

COMMITMENTS
    AND CONTINGENCIES

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets or PRP in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in recent years and in certain cases,
    such as the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation
    uncoated paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal
    Cartridge Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition
    of Lincoln Industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the Tools
    Group in 2004, we have retained responsibility and potential
    liability for certain environmental obligations. We have
    received claims for indemnification from purchasers of these
    businesses and have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for potential liabilities arising out of retained
    responsibilities. We settled some of the claims in prior years;
    to date our recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites relating to operations no longer carried out at
    the sites. We have established what we believe to be adequate
    accruals for remediation costs at these sites. We do not believe
    that projected response costs will result in a material
    liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles in the United States (“GAAP”). As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, our undiscounted reserves for
    such environmental liabilities were approximately
    $1.3 million and $2.3 million, respectively. We cannot
    ensure that environmental requirements will not change or become
    more stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.



Stand-by
    letters of credit and bonds

In the ordinary course of business, we are required to commit to
    bonds that require payments to our customers for any
    non-performance. The outstanding face value of the bonds
    fluctuates with the value of our projects in process and in our
    backlog. In addition, we issue financial stand-by letters of
    credit primarily to secure our performance to third parties
    under self-insurance programs and certain legal matters. As of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, the outstanding value of these
    instruments totaled $116.5 million and $51.2 million,
    respectively.

NEW
    ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

See ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for information pertaining to recently
    adopted accounting standards or accounting standards to be
    adopted in the future.

CRITICAL
    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

We have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the
    consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting
    principles generally accepted in the United States. Our
    significant accounting policies are more fully described in
    ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial
    Statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the
    application of significant judgment by management in selecting
    the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.
    By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent
    degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our
    historical experience, terms of existing contracts, our
    observance of trends in the industry and information available
    from other outside sources, as appropriate. We consider an
    accounting estimate to be critical if:

•

it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were
    uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and

•

changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could
    have selected would have had a material impact on our financial
    condition or results of operations.

Our critical accounting estimates include the following:

Impairment
    of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangibles

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is
    tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The
    impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the
    first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including
    goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit, an indication that goodwill
    impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order
    to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any, that
    should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is
    recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of
    that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
    by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner
    similar to a purchase price allocation.

The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a
    discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting
    discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant
    estimates regarding future revenues and expenses, projected
    capital expenditures, changes in working capital and the
    appropriate discount rate. Use of the market approach consists
    of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded companies that are
    similar in size and industry. Actual results may differ from
    those used in our valuations.

In developing our discounted cash flow analysis, assumptions
    about future revenues and expenses, capital expenditures and
    changes in working capital are based on our annual operating
    plan and long-term business plan for each of our reporting
    units. These plans take into consideration numerous factors
    including historical experience, anticipated future economic
    conditions, changes in raw material prices and growth
    expectations for the industries and end markets we participate
    in. These assumptions are determined over a five year long-term
    planning period. The five year growth rates for revenues and
    operating profits vary for each reporting unit



being evaluated. Revenues and operating profit beyond 2017 are
    projected to grow at a 3% perpetual growth rate for all
    reporting units.

Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into
    consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future
    cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our
    weighted-average cost of capital. We utilized a discount rate
    ranging from 13% to 15% in determining the discounted cash flows
    in our fair value analysis.

In estimating fair value using the market approach, we identify
    a group of comparable publicly-traded companies for each
    operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product
    offering. These groups of comparable companies are used to
    develop multiples based on total market-based invested capital
    as a multiple of EBITDA. We determine our estimated values by
    applying these comparable EBITDA multiples to the operating
    results of our reporting units. The ultimate fair value of each
    reporting unit is determined considering the results of both
    valuation methods.

We completed step one of our annual goodwill impairment
    evaluation during the fourth quarter with each reporting
    unit’s fair value exceeding its carrying value.
    Accordingly, step two of the impairment analysis was not
    required.

In connection with our annual impairment test, we determined
    that the fair value of one of our reporting units did not exceed
    its carrying value by a significant amount. Goodwill for this
    reporting unit was $436.6 million at December 31,
    2010. If cash flow projections decreased by 2.7% or if the
    discount rate increased by 50 basis points (the discount
    rate used in the impairment analysis was 13.5%), this reporting
    unit would have failed the step one test and a step two analysis
    would have been required.

Indefinite-Lived
    Intangibles

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary
    technology and customer relationships. Identifiable intangibles
    with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable
    intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized.
    Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization
    are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization are tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if events warrant. During the fourth quarter of 2010
    and 2009, we completed our annual impairment test for those
    identifiable assets not subject to amortization. There were no
    impairment charges recorded in 2010. We recorded impairment
    charges of $11.3 million in 2009. These charges were
    recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value
    of the trade name with its carrying value. Fair value is
    measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method
    assumes the trade name has value to the extent that the owner is
    relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits
    received from them. This method requires us to estimate the
    future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty
    rate and the weighted average cost of capital. The impairment
    charge recorded in 2009 was the result of significant declines
    in sales volume.

At December 31, 2010 our goodwill and intangible assets
    were approximately $2,519.6 million and represented
    approximately 63.4% of our total assets. If we experience
    further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet
    our operating forecasts, we may be subject to future
    impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the
    future performance of our businesses, increases in the discount
    rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our
    businesses or significant declines in our stock price or the
    market as a whole could result in additional impairment
    indicators. Because of the significance of our goodwill and
    intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Impairment
    of Long-lived Assets

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying



value of the asset or asset group from the expected future
    pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges)
    of the related operations. If these cash flows are less than the
    carrying value of such asset, an impairment loss is recognized
    for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying
    value. Impairment losses on long-lived assets held for sale are
    determined in a similar manner, except that fair values are
    reduced for the cost to dispose of the assets. The measurement
    of impairment requires us to estimate future cash flows and the
    fair value of long-lived assets.

Pension

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. The amounts recognized in our
    consolidated financial statements related to our defined-benefit
    pension and other post-retirement plans are determined from
    actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are
    assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount
    rates, rate of increase in future compensation levels and health
    care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually
    and are disclosed in ITEM 8, Note 12 to the Notes to
    Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes to these assumptions
    will affect pension expense, pension contributions and the
    funded status of our pension plans.

We recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined
    benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in
    our Consolidated Balance Sheets, with changes in the funded
    status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in
    which they occur.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments
    from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our
    U.S. plans of 5.90% in 2010, 6.00% in 2009 and 6.50% in
    2008. The discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 0.75%
    to 5.40% in 2010, 2.00% to 6.00% in 2009 and 2.00% to 6.25% in
    2008. There are no other known or anticipated changes in our
    discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in
    2011.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.5% for 2010,
    2009 and 2008. The expected rate of return is designed to be a
    long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices.

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which
    they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose are the
    difference between the expected return calculated using the
    market-related value of assets and the actual return based on
    the market-related value of assets. Since the market-related
    value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

See ITEM 8, Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements for further information regarding pension
    plans.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE
    AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

Market risk is the potential economic loss that may result from
    adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments. We
    are exposed to various market risks, including changes in
    interest rates and foreign currency rates. We use derivative
    financial instruments to manage or reduce the impact of changes
    in interest rates. Counterparties to all derivative contracts
    are major financial institutions. All instruments are entered
    into for other than trading purposes. The major accounting
    policies and utilization of these instruments is described more
    fully in ITEM 8, Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated
    Financial Statements.



Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result
    in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement. In this
    case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable
    interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are
    at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for
    $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus .60% for
    $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all
    of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to
    continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if
    we continue to be in a net pay position.

Interest
    rate risk

Our debt portfolio, excluding impact of swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2010, was comprised of debt predominantly
    denominated in U.S. dollars. This debt portfolio is
    comprised of 56% fixed-rate debt and 44% variable-rate debt, not
    considering the effects of our interest rate swaps. Taking into
    account the variable to fixed-rate swap agreements we entered
    into with an effective date of April 2006 and August 2007, our
    debt portfolio is comprised of 85% fixed-rate debt and 15%
    variable-rate debt. Changes in interest rates have different
    impacts on the fixed and variable-rate portions of our debt
    portfolio. A change in interest rates on the fixed portion of
    the debt portfolio impacts the fair value but has no impact on
    interest incurred or cash flows. A change in interest rates on
    the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest
    incurred and cash flows but does not impact the net financial
    instrument position.

Based on the fixed-rate debt included in our debt portfolio, as
    of December 31, 2010, a 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates would result in a $20.0 million
    increase or decrease in fair value.

Based on the variable-rate debt included in our debt portfolio,
    including the interest rate swap agreements, as of
    December 31, 2010, a 100 basis point increase or
    decrease in interest rates would result in a $1.0 million
    increase or decrease in interest incurred.

Foreign
    currency risk

We conduct business in various locations throughout the world
    and are subject to market risk due to changes in the value of
    foreign currencies in relation to our reporting currency, the
    U.S. dollar. We generally do not use derivative financial
    instruments to manage these risks. The functional currencies of
    our foreign operating locations are the local currency in the
    country of domicile. We manage these operating activities at the
    local level and revenues, costs, assets and liabilities are
    generally denominated in local currencies, thereby mitigating
    the risk associated with changes in foreign exchange. However,
    our results of operations and assets and liabilities are
    reported in U.S. dollars and thus will fluctuate with
    changes in exchange rates between such local currencies and the
    U.S. dollar. From time to time, we may enter in to short
    duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency
    risk on intercompany transactions.



ITEM 8.

FINANCIAL
    STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA

MANAGEMENT’S
    REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

Management of Pentair, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the
    “Company”) is responsible for establishing and
    maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting,
    as such term is defined in

Rules 13a-15(f)

and

15d-15(f)

of
    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal
    control over financial reporting is designed to provide
    reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial
    reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
    external purposes in accordance with generally accepted
    accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over
    financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
    (1) pertain to maintenance of records that, in reasonable
    detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
    dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide
    reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
    to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance
    with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts
    and expenditures of the Company are being made only in
    accordance with authorizations of management and directors of
    the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding
    prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use
    or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a
    material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over
    financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.
    Also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of
    internal control over financial reporting to future periods are
    subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate
    because of changes in conditions or that the degree of
    compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, management
    used the criteria for effective internal control over financial
    reporting described in

Internal Control-Integrated Framework

issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
    Treadway Commission. Based on this assessment, management
    believes that, as of December 31, 2010, the Company’s
    internal control over financial reporting was effective based on
    those criteria.

Our independent registered public accounting firm,
    Deloitte & Touche LLP, has issued an attestation
    report on the Company’s internal control over financial
    reporting as of year ended December 31, 2010. That
    attestation report is set forth immediately following this
    management report.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission. The Company’s management is responsible for
    maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting
    and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control
    over financial reporting, included in the accompanying
    Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial
    Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting based
    on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control
    over financial reporting was maintained in all material
    respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of
    internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
    that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the
    design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on
    the assessed risk and performing such other procedures as we
    considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our
    audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a
    process designed by, or under the supervision of, the
    company’s principal executive and principal financial
    officers, or persons performing similar functions and effected
    by the company’s board of directors, management and other
    personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the
    reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of
    financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
    generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s
    internal control over financial reporting includes those
    policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance
    of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
    reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the
    company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions
    are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
    statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
    principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
    being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
    and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable
    assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of
    unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
    company’s assets that could have a material effect on the
    financial statements.

Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over
    financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or
    improper management override of controls, material misstatements
    due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a
    timely basis. Also, projections of any evaluation of the
    effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting
    to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may
    become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the
    degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
    deteriorate.

In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material
    respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as
    of December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 as of and for the
    year ended December 31, 2010 of the Company and our report
    dated February 22, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion on
    those consolidated financial statements and financial statement
    schedule.

REPORT OF
    INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of

Pentair, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
    Pentair, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of
    December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated
    statements of income, changes in shareholders’ equity and
    cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
    December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial
    statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15. These
    financial statements and financial statement schedule are the
    responsibility of the Company’s management. Our
    responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial
    statements and financial statement schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those
    standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
    reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are
    free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
    test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
    the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the
    accounting principles used and significant estimates made by
    management, as well as evaluating the overall financial
    statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a
    reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present
    fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the
    Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 2010 and 2009 and
    the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of
    the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America. Also, in our opinion, such financial
    statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic
    consolidated financial statements taken as a whole, present
    fairly, in all material respects, the information set forth
    therein.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the
    Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the
    Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of
    December 31, 2010, based on the criteria established in

Internal Control — Integrated Framework

issued
    by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway
    Commission and our report dated February 22, 2011 expressed
    an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control
    over financial reporting.

Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements

1. Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies

Fiscal year

Our fiscal year ends on December 31.

We
    report our interim quarterly periods on a 13-week basis ending
    on a Saturday.

Principles
    of consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the
    accounts of Pentair and all subsidiaries, both U.S. and

non-U.S.,

that we control. Intercompany accounts and transactions have
    been eliminated. Investments in companies of which we own 20% to
    50% of the voting stock or have the ability to exercise
    significant influence over operating and financial policies of
    the investee are accounted for using the equity method of
    accounting and as a result, our share of the earnings or losses
    of such equity affiliates is included in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Use of
    estimates

The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in
    conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
    United States of America (“GAAP”) requires us to make
    estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in
    these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
    Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates,
    actual results reported in future periods may be based upon
    amounts that could differ from those estimates. The critical
    accounting policies that require our most significant estimates
    and judgments include:

•

the assessment of recoverability of long-lived assets, including
    goodwill and indefinite-life intangibles; and

•

accounting for pension benefits, because of the importance in
    making the estimates necessary to apply these policies.

Revenue
    recognition

We recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and has
    been earned. Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of
    an arrangement exists; shipment or delivery has occurred
    (depending on the terms of the sale); the seller’s price to
    the buyer is fixed or determinable; and collectability is
    reasonably assured.

Generally, there is no post-shipment obligation on product sold
    other than warranty obligations in the normal and ordinary
    course of business. In the event significant post-shipment
    obligations were to exist, revenue recognition would be deferred
    until substantially all obligations were satisfied.

Sales
    returns

The right of return may exist explicitly or implicitly with our
    customers. Our return policy allows for customer returns only
    upon our authorization. Goods returned must be product we
    continue to market and must be in salable condition. Returns of
    custom or modified goods are normally not allowed. At the time
    of sale, we reduce revenue for the estimated effect of returns.
    Estimated sales returns include consideration of historical
    sales levels, the timing and magnitude of historical sales
    return levels as a percent of sales, type of product, type of
    customer and a projection of this experience into the future.

Pricing
    and sales incentives

We record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs
    and incentive offerings including pricing arrangements,
    promotions and other volume-based incentives at the later of the
    date revenue is recognized or the incentive is offered. Sales
    incentives given to our customers are recorded as a reduction of
    revenue unless we (1) receive an identifiable benefit for
    the goods or services in exchange for the consideration and
    (2) we



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

can reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received.
    The following represents a description of our pricing
    arrangements, promotions and other volume-based incentives:

Pricing
    arrangements

Pricing is established up front with our customers and we record
    sales at the

agreed-upon

net selling price. However, one of our businesses allows
    customers to apply for a refund of a percentage of the original
    purchase price if they can demonstrate sales to a qualifying OEM
    customer. At the time of sale, we estimate the anticipated
    refund to be paid based on historical experience and reduce
    sales for the probable cost of the discount. The cost of these
    refunds is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Promotions

Our primary promotional activity is what we refer to as
    cooperative advertising. Under our cooperative advertising
    programs, we agree to pay the customer a fixed percentage of
    sales as an allowance that may be used to advertise and promote
    our products. The customer is generally not required to provide
    evidence of the advertisement or promotion. We recognize the
    cost of this cooperative advertising at the time of sale. The
    cost of this program is recorded as a reduction in gross sales.

Volume-based
    incentives

These incentives involve rebates that are negotiated up front
    with the customer and are redeemable only if the customer
    achieves a specified cumulative level of sales or sales
    increase. Under these incentive programs, at the time of sale,
    we reforecast the anticipated rebate to be paid based on
    forecasted sales levels. These forecasts are updated at least
    quarterly for each customer and sales are reduced for the
    anticipated cost of the rebate. If the forecasted sales for a
    customer changes, the accrual for rebates is adjusted to reflect
    the new amount of rebates expected to be earned by the customer.

Shipping
    and handling costs

Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are
    recorded in

Net sales

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs incurred by
    Pentair for the delivery of goods to customers are included in

Cost of goods sold

in the accompanying Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Research
    and development

We conduct research and development (“R&D”)
    activities in our own facilities, which consist primarily of the
    development of new products, product applications and
    manufacturing processes. We expense R&D costs as incurred.
    R&D expenditures during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were
    $67.2 million, $57.9 million and $62.5 million,
    respectively.

Cash
    equivalents

We consider highly liquid investments with original maturities
    of three months or less to be cash equivalents.

Trade
    receivables and concentration of credit risk

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts; reducing our
    receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from
    our customers. Estimates used in determining the allowance for
    doubtful accounts are based on historical collection experience,
    current trends, aging of accounts receivable and periodic credit
    evaluations of our customers’ financial condition. We
    generally do not require collateral. No customer receivable
    balances exceeded 10% of total net receivable balances as of
    December 31, 2010. One customer had a receivable balance of
    approximately 10% of the total net receivable balance as of
    December 31, 2009.

In December 2008 we sold approximately $44 million of one
    customer’s accounts receivable to a third-party financial
    institution to mitigate accounts receivable concentration risk.
    Sales of accounts receivable are reflected as a reduction of
    accounts receivable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and the
    proceeds are



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

included in the cash flows from operating activities in our
    Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. In 2008, a loss in the
    amount of $0.5 million related to the sale of accounts
    receivable is included in the line item

Other

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income. We did not undertake a
    similar sale of customer receivables in 2010 or 2009.

Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with
    substantially all costed using the

first-in,

first-out (“FIFO”) method and with an insignificant
    amount of inventories located outside the United States costed
    using a moving average method which approximates FIFO.

Property,
    plant and equipment

Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost. We
    compute depreciation by the straight-line method based on the
    following estimated useful lives:

Years

Land improvements

5 to 20

Buildings and leasehold improvements

5 to 50

Machinery and equipment

3 to 15

Significant improvements that add to productive capacity or
    extend the lives of properties are capitalized. Costs for
    repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When
    property is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and
    related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts
    and any related gains or losses are included in income.

We review the recoverability of long-lived assets to be held and
    used, such as property, plant and equipment, when events or
    changes in circumstances occur that indicate the carrying value
    of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable. The
    assessment of possible impairment is based on our ability to
    recover the carrying value of the asset or asset group from the
    expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without
    interest charges) of the related operations. If these cash flows
    are less than the carrying value of such asset or asset group,
    an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between
    estimated fair value and carrying value. Impairment losses on
    long-lived assets held for sale are determined in a similar
    manner, except that fair values are reduced for the cost to
    dispose of the assets. The measurement of impairment requires us
    to estimate future cash flows and the fair value of long-lived
    assets.

Goodwill
    and identifiable intangible assets

Goodwill

Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired
    businesses over the fair value of identifiable tangible net
    assets and identifiable intangible assets purchased.

Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and is
    tested for impairment more frequently if events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The
    impairment test is performed using a two-step process. In the
    first step, the fair value of each reporting unit is compared
    with the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including
    goodwill. If the estimated fair value is less than the carrying
    amount of the reporting unit, an indication that goodwill
    impairment exists and a second step must be completed in order
    to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment, if any, that
    should be recorded. In the second step, an impairment loss is
    recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the
    reporting unit’s goodwill over the implied fair value of
    that goodwill. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined
    by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner
    similar to a purchase price allocation.

The fair value of each reporting unit is determined using a
    discounted cash flow analysis and market approach. Projecting
    discounted future cash flows requires us to make significant
    estimates regarding future revenues and



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

expenses, projected capital expenditures, changes in working
    capital and the appropriate discount rate. Use of the market
    approach consists of comparisons to comparable publicly-traded
    companies that are similar in size and industry. Actual results
    may differ from those used in our valuations. This non-recurring
    fair value measurement is a “Level 3” measurement
    under the fair value hierarchy described below.

In developing our discounted cash flow analysis, assumptions
    about future revenues and expenses, capital expenditures and
    changes in working capital, are based on our annual operating
    plan and long-term business plan for each of our reporting
    units. These plans take into consideration numerous factors
    including historical experience, anticipated future economic
    conditions, changes in raw material prices and growth
    expectations for the industries and end markets we participate
    in. These assumptions are determined over a five year long-term
    planning period. The five year growth rates for revenues and
    operating profits vary for each reporting unit being evaluated.
    Revenues and operating profit beyond 2017 are projected to grow
    at a 3% perpetual growth rate for all reporting units.

Discount rate assumptions for each reporting unit take into
    consideration our assessment of risks inherent in the future
    cash flows of the respective reporting unit and our
    weighted-average cost of capital. We utilized discount rates
    ranging from 13% to 15% in determining the discounted cash flows
    in our fair value analysis.

In estimating fair value using the market approach, we identify
    a group of comparable publicly-traded companies for each
    operating segment that are similar in terms of size and product
    offering. These groups of comparable companies are used to
    develop multiples based on total market-based invested capital
    as a multiple of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation
    and amortization (EBITDA). We determine our estimated values by
    applying these comparable EBITDA multiples to the operating
    results of our reporting units. The ultimate fair value of each
    reporting unit is determined considering the results of both
    valuation methods.

Identifiable
    intangible assets

Our primary identifiable intangible assets include trade marks
    and trade names, patents, non-compete agreements, proprietary
    technology and customer relationships. Identifiable intangibles
    with finite lives are amortized and those identifiable
    intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized.
    Identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization
    are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in
    circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be
    recoverable. Identifiable intangible assets not subject to
    amortization are tested for impairment annually or more
    frequently if events warrant. During the fourth quarter of 2010
    and 2009, we completed our annual impairment test for those
    identifiable assets not subject to amortization and recorded
    impairment charges in 2009 of $11.3 million, related to
    trade names. These charges were recorded in

Selling, general
    and administrative

in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
    There was no impairment charge required in 2010.

The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value
    of the trade name with its carrying value. Fair value is
    measured using the relief-from-royalty method. This method
    assumes the trade name has value to the extent that their owner
    is relieved of the obligation to pay royalties for the benefits
    received from them. This method requires us to estimate the
    future revenue for the related brands, the appropriate royalty
    rate and the weighted average cost of capital. This
    non-recurring fair value measurement is a
    “Level 3” measurement under the fair value
    hierarchy described below. The impairment charge was the result
    of significant declines in sales volume. These charges were
    recorded in

Selling, general and administrative

in our
    Consolidated Statements of Income.

At December 31, 2010 our goodwill and intangible assets
    were approximately $2,519.6 million and represented
    approximately 63.4% of our total assets. If we experience
    further declines in sales and operating profit or do not meet
    our operating forecasts, we may be subject to future
    impairments. Additionally, changes in assumptions regarding the
    future performance of our businesses, increases in the discount
    rate used to determine the discounted cash flows of our
    businesses or significant declines in our stock price or the
    market as a whole could result in additional impairment
    indicators. Because of the significance of our goodwill and



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could
    have a material adverse effect on our financial results.

Equity
    method investments

We have investments that are accounted using the equity method.
    Our proportionate share of income or losses from investments
    accounted for under the equity method is recorded in the
    Consolidated Statements of Income. We write down or write off an
    investment and recognize a loss when events or circumstances
    indicate there is impairment in the investment that is

other-than-temporary.

This requires significant judgment, including assessment of the
    investees’ financial condition and in certain cases the
    possibility of subsequent rounds of financing, as well as the
    investees’ historical and projected results of operations
    and cash flows. If the actual outcomes for the investees are
    significantly different from projections, we may incur future
    charges for the impairment of these investments.

We have a 50% investment in FARADYNE Motors LLC
    (“FARADYNE”), a joint venture with ITT Water
    Technologies, Inc. that began design, development and
    manufacturing of submersible pump motors in 2005. We do not
    consolidate the investment in our consolidated financial
    statements as we do not have a controlling interest over the
    investment. There were investments in and loans to FARADYNE of
    $6.1 million and $4.5 million at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively, which is net of
    our proportionate share of the results of their operations.

Income
    taxes

We use the asset and liability approach to account for income
    taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
    are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of
    differences between the carrying amounts of assets and
    liabilities and their respective tax basis using enacted tax
    rates in effect for the year in which the differences are
    expected to reverse. The effect on deferred tax assets and
    liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in
    the period when the change is enacted. Deferred tax assets are
    reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of
    management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all
    of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Changes in
    valuation allowances from period to period are included in our
    tax provision in the period of change. We recognize the effect
    of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely
    than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are
    measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely
    of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are
    reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.

Environmental

We recognize environmental

clean-up

liabilities on an undiscounted basis when a loss is probable and
    can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities generally are not
    subject to insurance coverage. The cost of each environmental

clean-up

is
    estimated by engineering, financial and legal specialists based
    on current law. Such estimates are based primarily upon the
    estimated cost of investigation and remediation required and the
    likelihood that, where applicable, other potentially responsible
    parties (“PRPs”) will be able to fulfill their
    commitments at the sites where Pentair may be jointly and
    severally liable. The process of estimating environmental

clean-up

liabilities is complex and dependent primarily on the nature and
    extent of historical information and physical data relating to a
    contaminated site, the complexity of the site, the uncertainty
    as to what remedy and technology will be required and the
    outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other PRPs
    at multi-party sites. In future periods, new laws or
    regulations, advances in

clean-up

technologies and additional information about the ultimate

clean-up

remedy that is used could significantly change our estimates.
    Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in

Other
    current liabilities

and

Other non-current liabilities

in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Insurance
    subsidiary

We insure certain general and product liability, property,
    workers’ compensation and automobile liability risks
    through our regulated wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary,
    Penwald Insurance Company (“Penwald”). Reserves for
    policy claims are established based on actuarial projections of
    ultimate losses. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, reserves
    for policy claims were $49.0 million ($12.0 million
    included in

Accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $37.0 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

) and $56.3 million ($10.0 million
    included in

Accrued product claims and warranties

and
    $46.3 million included in

Other non-current
    liabilities

), respectively.

Stock-based
    compensation

We account for stock-based compensation awards on a fair value
    basis. The estimated grant date fair value of each option award
    is recognized in income on an accelerated basis over the
    requisite service period (generally the vesting period). The
    estimated fair value of each option award is calculated using
    the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. From time to time, we
    have elected to modify the terms of the original grant. These
    modified grants are accounted for as a new award and measured
    using the fair value method, resulting in the inclusion of
    additional compensation expense in our Consolidated Statements
    of Income. Restricted share awards and units are recorded as
    compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite
    service periods based on the market value on the date of grant.

Earnings
    per common share

Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by
    the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding.
    Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income
    by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
    including the dilutive effects of common stock equivalents. The
    dilutive effects of stock options and restricted stock awards
    and units increased weighted average common shares outstanding
    by 1,257 thousand, 1,107 thousand and 1,181 thousand in 2010,
    2009 and 2008, respectively.

Stock options excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings
    per share because the exercise price was greater than the
    average market price of the common shares were 3,711 thousand,
    5,283 thousand and 5,268 thousand in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
    respectively.

Derivative
    financial instruments

We recognize all derivatives, including those embedded in other
    contracts, as either assets or liabilities at fair value in our
    Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the derivative is designated as
    a fair-value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the
    derivative and the hedged item are recognized in earnings. If
    the derivative is designated and is effective as a cash-flow
    hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded
    in other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and are
    recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the
    hedged item affects earnings. If the underlying hedged
    transaction ceases to exist or if the hedge becomes ineffective,
    all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have
    not been settled are recognized in current earnings. For a
    derivative that is not designated as or does not qualify as a
    hedge, changes in fair value are reported in earnings
    immediately.

We use derivative instruments for the purpose of hedging
    interest rate and currency exposures, which exist as part of
    ongoing business operations. We do not hold or issue derivative
    financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. All
    other contracts that contain provisions meeting the definition
    of a derivative also meet the requirements of and have been
    designated as, normal purchases or sales. Our policy is not to
    enter into contracts with terms that cannot be designated as
    normal purchases or sales. From time to time, we may enter in to
    short duration foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign
    currency risks on intercompany transactions.

Fair
    value measurements

Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to
    sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
    transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
    Assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified
    using the following hierarchy, which is based upon the
    transparency of inputs to the valuation as of the measurement
    date:

Level 1:

Valuation is based on observable
    inputs such as quoted market prices (unadjusted) for identical
    assets or liabilities in active markets.

Level 2:

Valuation is based on inputs
    such as quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities
    in active markets or other inputs that are observable for the
    asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for
    substantially the full term of the financial instrument.

Level 3:

Valuation is based upon other
    unobservable inputs that are significant to the fair value
    measurement.

In making fair value measurements, observable market data must
    be used when available. When inputs used to measure fair value
    fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within
    which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the
    lowest level input that is significant to the fair value
    measurement.

Foreign
    currency translation

The financial statements of subsidiaries located outside of the
    U.S. are measured using the local currency as the
    functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these
    subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the
    balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at
    average monthly rates of exchange. The resultant translation
    adjustments are included in

Accumulated other comprehensive
    income (loss)

(“AOCI”), a separate component of
    shareholders’ equity.

New
    accounting standards

On January 1, 2009, we adopted new accounting guidance that
    changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests.
    Minority interests have been recharacterized as noncontrolling
    interests and are reported as a component of equity separate
    from the parent’s equity. Purchases or sales of equity
    interests that do not result in a change in control will be
    accounted for as equity transactions. In addition, net income
    attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in
    consolidated net income on the face of the Consolidated Income
    Statements and upon a loss of control, the interest sold, as
    well as any interest retained, will be recorded at fair value
    with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. We have classified
    noncontrolling interest (previously minority interest) as a
    component of equity for all periods presented.

In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an
    amendment to the accounting and disclosure requirements for the
    consolidation of variable interest entities. The guidance
    affects the overall consolidation analysis and requires enhanced
    disclosures on involvement with variable interest entities. The
    guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
    November 15, 2009. We adopted the new guidance as of
    January 1, 2010, which did not have any effect on our
    consolidated financial statements.

Subsequent
    events

In connection with preparing the audited consolidated financial
    statements for the year ended December 31, 2010, we have
    evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and
    disclosure through the date of this filing.

2. Acquisitions

On June 28, 2008, we entered into a transaction with GE
    Water & Process Technologies (a unit of General
    Electric Company) (“GE”) that was accounted for as an
    acquisition of an 80.1 percent ownership interest in
    GE’s global water softener and residential water filtration
    business in exchange for a 19.9 percent interest in



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

our global water softener and residential water filtration
    business. The acquisition was effected through the formation of
    two new entities (collectively, “Pentair Residential
    Filtration” or “PRF”), a U.S. entity and an
    international entity, into which we and GE contributed certain
    assets, properties, liabilities and operations representing our
    respective global water softener and residential water
    filtration businesses. We are an 80.1 percent owner of PRF
    and GE is a 19.9 percent owner. The fair value of the
    acquisition was $229.2 million, which includes
    approximately $3.3 million of acquisition related costs.
    The acquisition and related sale of our 19.9 percent
    interest resulted in a gain of $109.6 million
    ($85.8 million after tax), representing the difference
    between the carrying amount and the fair value of the
    19.9 percent interest sold.

With the formation of Pentair Residential Filtration, we believe
    we are better positioned to serve residential customers with
    industry-leading technical applications in the areas of water
    conditioning, whole-house filtration, point of use water
    management and water sustainability and expect to accelerate
    revenue growth by selling GE’s existing residential
    conditioning products through our sales channels.

The fair value of the 80.1 percent interest in the global
    water softener and residential water filtration business of GE
    acquired was determined using both an income approach and a
    market approach. The income approach utilizes a discounted cash
    flow analysis based on certain key assumptions including a
    discount rate based on a computed weighted average cost of
    capital and expected long-term revenue and expense growth rates.
    The market approach indicates the fair value of a business based
    on a comparison of the business to guideline publicly traded
    companies and transactions in its industry.

The fair value of the business acquired was allocated to the
    assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated
    fair values. The excess of the fair value acquired over the
    identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed is
    reflected as goodwill. Goodwill recorded as part of the purchase
    price allocation was approximately $137.9 million, none of
    which is tax deductible. Identifiable intangible assets acquired
    as part of the acquisition were $66.5 million, including
    definite-lived intangibles, such as customer relationships,
    proprietary technology and trade names with a weighted average
    amortization period of approximately 15 years.

The following pro forma consolidated condensed financial results
    of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008 is
    presented as if the acquisition had been completed at the
    beginning of the period presented:

3. Discontinued
    Operations

In 2010 we were notified of a product recall required by our
    former Tools Group (which was sold to Black and Decker
    Corporation in 2004 and treated as a discontinued operation).
    Under the terms of the sale agreement we are liable for a
    portion of the product recall costs for products sold prior to
    the date of sale of the Tools Group. We recorded a liability of
    $3.2 million ($2.0 million net of tax) in 2010
    representing our estimate of the potential cost associated with
    this recall. In addition, we received the remaining escrow
    balances from our sale of Lincoln Industrial of approximately
    $0.5 million, and we reversed tax reserves of approximately
    $1.0 million due to the expiration of various statues of
    limitations.

On December 15, 2008, we sold our Spa and Bath
    (“Spa/Bath”) business to Balboa Water Group in a cash
    transaction for $9.2 million. The results of Spa/Bath have
    been reported as discontinued operations for all periods
    presented. Goodwill of $5.6 million was included in the
    assets of Spa/Bath.

On February 28, 2008, we sold our National Pool Tile
    (“NPT”) business to Pool Corporation in a cash
    transaction for $29.8 million. The results of NPT have been
    reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.
    Goodwill of $16.8 million was included in the assets of NPT.

Restructuring

During 2009 and 2008, we announced and initiated certain
    business restructuring initiatives aimed at reducing our fixed
    cost structure and rationalizing our manufacturing footprint.
    These initiatives included the announcement of the closure of
    certain manufacturing facilities as well as the reduction in
    hourly and salaried headcount of approximately 800 and
    1700 employees in 2009 and 2008, respectively, which
    included 350 and 1,300 in the Water Group and 450 and 400 in the
    Technical Products Group. These actions were generally completed
    by the end of 2009.

Restructuring related costs included in

Selling, general and
    administrative

expenses on the Consolidated Statements of
    Income include costs for severance and related benefits, asset
    impairment charges and other restructuring costs as follows:

    and a decrease of deferred tax liabilities of $28.5 million
    ($27.5 million in the Water Group and $1.0 million in
    the Technical Products Group).

We have a multi-currency revolving Credit Facility (“Credit
    Facility”). The Credit Facility creates an unsecured,
    committed revolving credit facility of up to $800 million,
    with multi-currency sub facilities to support investments
    outside the U.S. The Credit Facility expires on
    June 4, 2012. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear
    interest at the rate of LIBOR plus 0.625%. Interest rates and
    fees on the Credit Facility vary based on our credit ratings.

We are authorized to sell short-term commercial paper notes to
    the extent availability exists under the Credit Facility. We use
    the Credit Facility as

back-up

liquidity to support 100% of commercial paper outstanding. Our
    use of commercial paper as a funding vehicle depends upon the
    relative interest rates for our paper compared to the cost of
    borrowing under our Credit Facility. As of December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009 we had no outstanding commercial
    paper.

    $702.5 million as of December 31, 2010, which was not
    limited by any of the credit agreement’s financial
    covenants as of that date.

In addition to the Credit Facility, we have $40.0 million
    of uncommitted credit facilities, under which we had
    $4.8 million of borrowings as of December 31, 2010.

Our debt agreements contain certain financial covenants, the
    most restrictive of which is a leverage ratio (total
    consolidated indebtedness, as defined, over consolidated EBITDA,
    as defined) that may not exceed 3.5 to 1.0. We were in
    compliance with all financial covenants in our debt agreements
    as of December 31, 2010.

On July 8, 2008, we commenced a cash tender offer for all
    of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal of
    7.85% Senior Notes due 2009 (the “Notes”). Upon
    expiration of the tender offer on August 4, 2008, we
    purchased $116.1 million aggregate principal amount of the
    Notes. As a result of this transaction, we recognized a loss of
    $4.6 million on early extinguishment of debt in 2008. The
    loss included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized
    deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of
    $0.6 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash
    paid of $5.1 million related to the tender premium and
    other costs associated with the purchase.

On March 16, 2009, we announced the redemption of all of
    our remaining outstanding $133.9 million aggregate
    principal of Notes. The Notes were redeemed on April 15,
    2009 at a redemption price of $1,035.88 per $1,000 of principal
    outstanding plus accrued interest thereon. As a result of this
    transaction, we recognized a loss of $4.8 million on early
    extinguishment of debt in the second quarter of 2009. The loss
    included the write off of $0.1 million in unamortized
    deferred financing fees in addition to recognition of
    $0.3 million in previously unrecognized swap gains and cash
    paid of $5.0 million related to the redemption and other
    costs associated with the purchase.

In August 2007, we entered into a $105 million interest
    rate swap agreement with a major financial institution to
    exchange variable rate interest payment obligations for a fixed
    rate obligation without the exchange of the underlying principal
    amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures. The
    effective date of the swap was August 30, 2007. The swap
    agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.89% and expires in May
    2012. The fixed interest rate of 4.89% plus the .50% interest
    rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective fixed interest
    rate of 5.39%. The fair value of the swap was a liability of
    $6.4 million and $8.1 million at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively and was recorded
    in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

In September 2005, we entered into a $100 million interest
    rate swap agreement with several major financial institutions to
    exchange variable-rate interest payment obligations for
    fixed-rate obligations without the exchange of the underlying
    principal amounts in order to manage interest rate exposures.
    The effective date of the fixed-rate swap was April 25,
    2006. The swap agreement has a fixed interest rate of 4.68% and
    expires in July 2013. The fixed interest rate of 4.68% plus the
    .60% interest rate spread over LIBOR results in an effective
    fixed interest rate of 5.28%. The fair value of the swap was a
    liability of $9.4 million and $8.3 million at
    December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively
    and was recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as
    cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps are recorded as
    assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
    Unrealized income/expense is included in



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

AOCI and realized income/expense and amounts due to/from swap
    counterparties, are included in earnings. We realized
    incremental interest expense resulting from the swaps of
    $9.2 million and $7.9 million at December 31,
    2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively.

The variable to fixed interest rate swaps are designated as and
    are effective as cash-flow hedges. The fair value of these swaps
    are recorded as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated
    Balance Sheets, with changes in their fair value included in
    OCI. Derivative gains and losses included in OCI are
    reclassified into earnings at the time the related interest
    expense is recognized or the settlement of the related
    commitment occurs.

Failure of one or more of our swap counterparties would result
    in the loss of any benefit to us of the swap agreement. In this
    case, we would continue to be obligated to pay the variable
    interest payments per the underlying debt agreements which are
    at variable interest rates of 3 month LIBOR plus .50% for
    $105 million of debt and 3 month LIBOR plus .60% for
    $100 million of debt. Additionally, failure of one or all
    of our swap counterparties would not eliminate our obligation to
    continue to make payments under our existing swap agreements if
    we continue to be in a net pay position.

At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our interest rate swaps are
    carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis. Fair values
    are determined through the use of models that consider various
    assumptions, including time value, yield curves, as well as
    other relevant economic measures, which are inputs that are
    classified as Level 2 in the valuation hierarchy.

Foreign
    currency hedges

At December 31, 2010 we had a euro to U.S. dollar
    contract that expired on January 7, 2011 with a notional
    amount of $132.5 million. The fair value of the contract
    was an asset of $1.2 million.

Included in the $24.3 million of total gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 was $22.4 million
    of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective
    tax rate. It is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized
    tax benefits as of December 31, 2010 may decrease by a
    range of $0 to $17.5 million during the next twelve months
    primarily as a result of the resolution of federal, state and
    foreign examinations and the expiration of various statutes of
    limitations.

The determination of annual income tax expense takes into
    consideration amounts which may be needed to cover exposures for
    open tax years. The Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”)
    has examined our U.S. federal income tax returns through
    2003 with no material adjustments. The IRS has also completed a
    survey of our 2004 U.S. federal income tax return with no
    material findings. The IRS is currently examining our federal
    tax returns for years 2005 through 2009. No material adjustments
    have been proposed, however, actual settlements may differ from
    amounts accrued.

We record penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax
    benefits in

Provision for income taxes

and

Interest
    expense

, respectively, which is consistent with our past
    practices. As of December 31, 2010, we had recorded
    approximately $0.8 million for the possible payment of
    penalties and $4.8 million related to the possible payment
    of interest expense.

U.S. income taxes have not been provided on undistributed
    earnings of international subsidiaries. It is our intention to
    reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the
    earnings only when it is tax effective to do so. As of
    December 31, 2010, approximately $223.7 million of
    unremitted earnings attributable to international subsidiaries
    were considered to be indefinitely invested. It is not
    practicable to estimate the amount of tax that might be payable
    if such earnings were to be remitted.

Deferred taxes arise because of different treatment between
    financial statement accounting and tax accounting, known as
    “temporary differences.” We record the tax effect of
    these temporary differences as “deferred tax assets”
    (generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit
    in future periods) and “deferred tax liabilities”
    (generally items for which we received a tax deduction but the
    tax impact has not yet been recorded in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income).

    foreign tax credit carryover from the tax period ended
    December 31, 2006 and related to state net operating
    losses. The foreign tax credit is eligible for carryforward
    until the tax period ending December 31, 2016.

Non-U.S. tax

losses of $49.6 million and $49.1 million were
    available for carryforward at December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively. A valuation allowance reflected above in Other,
    net of $9.4 million and $7.5 million exists for
    deferred income tax benefits related to the

non-U.S. loss

carryforwards available as of December 31, 2010 and 2009,
    respectively that may not be realized. We believe that
    sufficient taxable income will be generated in the respective
    countries to allow us to fully recover the remainder of the tax
    losses. The

non-U.S. operating

losses are subject to varying expiration periods and will begin
    to expire in 2011. State tax losses of $69.3 million and
    $73.0 million were available for carryforward at
    December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A valuation
    allowance reflected above in Other, net of $2.4 million and
    $2.6 million exists for deferred income tax benefits
    related to the carryforwards available at December 31, 2010

    2011, while others are subject to carryforward periods of up to
    twenty years.

Benefit
    Plans

Pension
    and post-retirement benefits

We sponsor domestic and foreign defined-benefit pension and
    other post-retirement plans. Pension benefits are based
    principally on an employee’s years of service

and/or

compensation levels near retirement. In addition, we also
    provide certain post-retirement health care and life insurance
    benefits. Generally, the post-retirement health care and life
    insurance plans require contributions from retirees. We use a
    December 31 measurement date each year. In December 2007, we
    announced that we will be freezing certain pension plans as of
    December 31, 2017.

Discount
    rate

The discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension
    liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year
    based on our December 31 measurement date. The discount rate was
    determined by matching our expected benefit payments to payments
    from a stream of AA or higher bonds available in the
    marketplace, adjusted to eliminate the effects of call
    provisions. This produced a discount rate for our
    U.S. plans of 5.90% in 2010, 6.00% in 2009 and 6.50% in
    2008. The discount rates on our foreign plans ranged from 0.75%
    to 5.40% in 2010, 2.00% to 6.00% in 2009 and 2.00% to 6.25% in
    2008. There are no other known or anticipated changes in our
    discount rate assumption that will impact our pension expense in
    2011.

Expected
    rate of return

Our expected rate of return on plan assets was 8.5% for 2010,
    2009 and 2008. The expected rate of return is designed to be a
    long-term assumption that may be subject to considerable

year-to-year

variance from actual returns. In developing the expected
    long-term rate of return, we considered our historical returns,
    with consideration given to forecasted economic conditions, our
    asset allocations, input from external consultants and broader
    longer-term market indices. In 2010, the pension plan assets
    yielded returns of 11.2% and returns of 19.5% in 2009 and a loss
    of 28.8% in 2008. Our expected rate of return on plan assets
    assumption is 8.0% for 2011.

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

We base our determination of pension expense or income on a
    market-related valuation of assets which reduces

year-to-year

volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment
    gains or losses over a

five-year

period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or
    losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected
    return calculated using the market-related value of assets and
    the actual return based on the market-related value of assets.
    Since the market-related value of assets recognizes gains or
    losses over a

five-year-period,

the future value of assets will be impacted as previously
    deferred gains or losses are recorded.

Unrecognized
    pension and post-retirement losses

As of our December 31, 2010 measurement date, our plans
    have $117.8 million of cumulative unrecognized losses. To
    the extent the unrecognized losses, when adjusted for the
    difference between market and market related values of assets,
    exceeds 10% of the projected benefit obligation, it will be
    amortized into expense each year on a straight-line basis over
    the remaining expected future-working lifetime of active
    participants (currently approximating 12 years).

The assumed health care cost trend rates at December 31 are as
    follows:



Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year

The assumed health care cost trend rates can have a significant

Objective

The primary objective of our investment strategy is to meet the
    pension obligation to our employees at a reasonable cost to us.
    This is primarily accomplished through growth of capital and
    safety of the funds invested. The plans will therefore be
    actively invested to achieve real growth of capital over
    inflation through appreciation of securities held and through
    the accumulation and reinvestment of dividend and interest
    income.

Asset
    allocation

Our actual overall asset allocation for the plans as compared to
    our investment policy goals is as follows:

While the target allocations do not have a percentage allocated
    to cash, the plan assets will always include some cash due to
    cash flow requirements. In 2009, as a result of our year end
    decision to make a $25 million



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

accelerated pension plan contribution, a higher percentage of
    assets were held in cash equivalents. This contribution was
    directed to be invested in fixed income investments and was
    invested shortly after year end. After taking this into
    consideration, our fixed income investment percentage would have
    been 30% and our cash percentage would have been 3%.

As part of our strategy to reduce U.S. pension plan funded
    status volatility, we plan to increase the allocation to long
    duration fixed income securities in future years as the funded
    status of our U.S. pension plans improve. In 2010 we
    increased our fixed income investments from 30% to 40% and from
    10% to 30% in 2009.

•

Cash Equivalents:

Consist of
    investments in commingled funds valued based on observable
    market data. Such investments are classified as Level 2.

•

Fixed Income:

Investments in corporate
    bonds, government securities, mortgages and asset backed
    securities are value based upon quoted market prices for
    identical or similar securities and other observable market
    data. Investments in commingled funds are generally valued at
    the net asset value of units held at the end of the period based
    upon the value of the underlying investments as determined by
    quoted market prices or by a pricing service. Such investments
    are classified as Level 2. Certain investments in
    commingled funds are valued based on unobservable inputs due to
    liquidation restrictions. These investments are classified as
    Level 3.

•

Global Equity Securities:

Equity
    securities and Pentair common stock are valued based on the
    closing market price in an active market and are classified as
    Level 1. Investments in commingled funds are valued at the
    net asset value of units held at the end of the period based
    upon the value of the underlying investments as determined by
    quoted market prices or by a pricing service. Such investments
    are classified as Level 2.

•

Other Investments:

Other investments
    include investments in commingled funds with diversified
    investment strategies. Investments in commingled funds that are
    valued at the net asset value of units held at the end of the
    period based upon the value of the underlying investments as
    determined by quoted market prices or by a pricing service are
    classified as Level 2. Investments in commingled funds that
    are valued based on unobservable inputs due to liquidation
    restrictions are classified as Level 3.

Contributions

Pension contributions totaled $49.8 million and
    $49.0 million in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our 2011
    required pension contributions are expected to be in the range
    of $25 million to $30 million. The decrease in the
    2011 expected contribution is primarily a result of the December
    2010 accelerated contribution of $25 million to our defined
    benefit pension plan. The 2011 expected contributions will equal
    or exceed our minimum funding requirements.

Savings
    plan

We have a 401(k) plan (“the plan”) with an employee
    stock ownership (“ESOP”) bonus component, which covers
    certain union and nearly all non-union U.S. employees who
    meet certain age requirements. Under the plan, eligible
    U.S. employees may voluntarily contribute a percentage of
    their eligible compensation. We match contributions made by
    employees who meet certain eligibility and service requirements.
    Our matching contribution is 100% of eligible employee
    contributions for the first 1% of eligible compensation and 50%
    of the next 5% of eligible compensation. In June 2009, we
    temporarily suspended the company match of the plan and ESOP. We
    reinstated the company match in 2010.

In addition to the matching contribution, all employees who meet
    certain service requirements receive a discretionary ESOP
    contribution equal to 1.5% of annual eligible compensation.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

Our combined expense for the plan and ESOP was approximately
    $11.0 million, $6.7 million and $17.0 million, in
    2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.

Other
    retirement compensation

Total other accrued retirement compensation was
    $13.9 million and $17.3 million in 2010 and 2009,
    respectively and is included in the pension and other retirement
    compensation line of our Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Shareholders’
    Equity

Authorized
    shares

We may issue up to 250 million shares of common stock. Our
    Board of Directors may designate up to 15 million of those
    shares as preferred stock. On December 10, 2004, the Board
    of Directors designated a new series of preferred stock with
    authorization to issue up to 2.5 million shares,
    Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value
    $0.10 per share. No shares of preferred stock were issued or
    outstanding as of December 31, 2010 or December 31,
    2009.

Purchase
    rights

On December 10, 2004, our Board of Directors declared a
    dividend of one preferred share purchase right (a
    “Right”) for each outstanding share of common stock.
    The dividend was payable upon the close of business on
    January 28, 2005 to the shareholders of record upon the
    close of business on January 28, 2005. Each Right entitles
    the registered holder to purchase one one-hundredth of a share
    of Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock, at a
    price of $240.00 per one one-hundredth of a share, subject to
    adjustment. However, the Rights are not exercisable unless
    certain change in control events occur, such as a person
    acquiring or obtaining the right to acquire beneficial ownership
    of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock. The description
    and terms of the Rights are set forth in a Rights Agreement,
    dated December 10, 2004. The Rights will expire on
    January 28, 2015, unless the Rights are earlier redeemed or
    exchanged in accordance with the terms of the Rights Agreement.
    On January 28, 2005, the common share purchase rights
    issued pursuant to the Rights Agreement dated July 31, 1995
    were redeemed in their entirety for an amount equal to $0.0025
    per right.

Share
    repurchases

In December 2007, the Board of Directors authorized the
    repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2008 up to a
    maximum dollar limit of $50 million. As of
    December 31, 2008, we had purchased 1,549,893 shares
    for $50.0 million pursuant to this authorization. This
    authorization expired on December 31, 2008. There were no
    share repurchase authorizations for 2009. On July 27, 2010
    the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of shares of
    our common stock up to a maximum dollar limit of
    $25 million. As of December 31, 2010 we had
    repurchased 734,603 shares for $25 million pursuant to
    this plan. In December 2010, the Board of Directors authorized
    the repurchase of shares of our common stock during 2011 up to a
    maximum dollar limit of $25 million. The authorization
    expires December 2011.

Stock
    Plans

Total stock-based compensation expense in 2010, 2009 and 2008
    was $21.5 million, $17.3 million and
    $20.6 million, respectively.

Omnibus
    stock incentive plans

In May 2008, the 2008 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan as Amended
    and Restated (the “2008 Plan” or the “Plan”)
    was approved by shareholders. The 2008 Plan authorizes the
    issuance of additional shares of our common stock and extends
    through February 2018. The 2008 Plan allows for the granting of:

•

nonqualified stock options;

•

incentive stock options;

•

restricted shares;

•

restricted stock units;

•

dividend equivalent units;

•

stock appreciation rights;

•

performance shares;

•

performance units; and

•

other stock based awards.

The Plan is administered by our Compensation Committee (the
    “Committee”), which is made up of independent members
    of our Board of Directors. Employees eligible to receive awards
    under the Plan are managerial, administrative or other key
    employees who are in a position to make a material contribution
    to the continued profitable growth and long-term success of
    Pentair. The Committee has the authority to select the
    recipients of awards, determine the type and size of awards,
    establish certain terms and conditions of award grants and take
    certain other actions as permitted under the Plan. The Plan
    restricts the Committee’s authority to reprice awards or to
    cancel and reissue awards at lower prices.

The Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan approved by the shareholders in
    2004 (the “2004 Plan”) expired upon approval of the
    2008 Plan by shareholders. Prior grants made under the 2004 Plan
    and earlier stock incentive plans remained outstanding on the
    terms in effect at the time of grant.

Non-qualified
    and incentive stock options

Under the Plan, we may grant stock options to any eligible
    employee with an exercise price equal to the market value of the
    shares on the dates the options were granted. Options generally
    vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant date and
    expire ten years after the grant date. Prior to 2006, option
    grants typically had a reload feature when shares are retired to
    pay the exercise price, allowing individuals to receive
    additional options upon exercise equal to the number of shares
    retired. Option awards granted after 2005 under the 2004 Plan
    and under the 2008 Plan do not have a reload feature attached to
    the option. Annual expense for the fair value of stock options
    was $10.7 million in 2010, $7.1 million in 2009 and
    $10.5 million in 2008.

Restricted
    shares and restricted stock units

Under the Plan, eligible employees are awarded restricted shares
    or restricted stock units (awards) of our common stock. Share
    awards generally vest from two to five years after issuance,
    subject to continuous employment and certain other conditions.
    Restricted share awards are valued at market value on the date
    of grant and are expensed over the vesting period. Annual
    expense for the fair value of restricted shares and restricted
    stock units was $10.8 million in 2010, $10.2 million
    in 2009 and $10.1 million in 2008.

Stock
    appreciation rights, performance shares and performance
    units

Under the Plan, the Committee is permitted to issue these
    awards; however, there have been no issuances of these awards.

Outside
    directors nonqualified stock option plan

Nonqualified stock options were granted to outside directors
    under the Outside Directors Nonqualified Stock Option Plan (the
    “Directors Plan”) with an exercise price equal to the
    market value of the shares on the option grant dates. Options
    generally vest over a three-year period commencing on the grant
    date and expire ten years after the grant date. The Directors
    Plan expired in January 2008. Prior grants remain outstanding on
    the terms in effect at the time of grant.

Non-employee Directors are also eligible to receive awards under
    the 2008 Plan. Director awards are made by our Governance
    Committee, which is made up of independent members of our Board
    of Directors.

Business
    Segments

We classify our continuing operations into the following
    business segments based primarily on types of products offered
    and markets served:

•

Water

— manufactures and markets
    essential products and systems used in the movement, storage,
    treatment and enjoyment of water. Water segment products include
    water and wastewater pumps; filtration and purification
    components and systems; storage tanks and pressure vessels; and
    pool and spa equipment and accessories.

•

Technical Products

— designs,
    manufactures and markets standard, modified and custom
    enclosures that house and protect sensitive electronics and
    electrical components and protect the people that use them.
    Applications served include industrial machinery, data
    communications, networking, telecommunications, test and
    measurement, automotive, medical, security, defense and general
    electronics. Products include metallic and composite enclosures,
    cabinets, cases, subracks, backplanes and associated thermal
    management systems.

•

Other

— is primarily composed of
    unallocated corporate expenses, our captive insurance
    subsidiary, intermediate finance companies and divested
    operations.

The accounting policies of our operating segments are the same
    as those described in the summary of significant accounting
    policies. We evaluate performance based on the sales and
    operating income of the segments and use a variety of ratios to
    measure performance. These results are not necessarily
    indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred
    had each segment been an independent, stand-alone entity during
    the periods presented.

Net sales are based on the location in which the sale
    originated. Long-lived assets represent property, plant and
    equipment, net of related depreciation.

We offer a broad array of products and systems to multiple
    markets and customers for which we do not have the information
    systems to track revenues by primary product category. However,
    our net sales by segment are representative of our sales by
    major product category.

We sell our products through various distribution channels
    including wholesale and retail distributors, original equipment
    manufacturers and home centers. In our Water segment, one
    customer accounted for approximately 10% of segment sales in
    2010, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of segment
    sales in 2009 and one customer accounted for just over 10% of
    segment sales in 2008. In our Technical Products segment, no
    single customer accounted for more than 10% of segment sales in
    2010, 2009 or 2008.

Environmental

We have been named as defendants, targets, or PRPs in a small
    number of environmental

clean-ups,

in which our current or former business units have generally
    been given

de minimis

status. To date, none of these
    claims have resulted in

clean-up

costs, fines, penalties, or damages in an amount material to our
    financial position or results of operations. We have disposed of
    a number of businesses in the past and in certain cases, such as
    the disposition of the Cross Pointe Paper Corporation uncoated
    paper business in 1995, the disposition of the Federal Cartridge
    Company ammunition business in 1997, the disposition of Lincoln
    Industrial in 2001 and the disposition of the Tools Group in
    2004, we have retained responsibility and potential liability
    for certain environmental obligations. We have received claims
    for indemnification from purchasers of these businesses and have
    established what we believe to be adequate accruals for
    potential liabilities arising out of retained responsibilities.
    We settled some of the claims in prior years; to date our
    recorded accruals have been adequate.

In addition, there are ongoing environmental issues at a limited
    number of sites, including one site acquired in the acquisition
    of Essef Corporation in 1999, which relates to operations no
    longer carried out at the sites. We have established what we
    believe to be adequate accruals for remediation costs at these
    sites. We do not believe that projected response costs will
    result in a material liability.

We may be named as a PRP at other sites in the future, for both
    divested and acquired businesses. When the outcome of the matter
    is probable and it is possible to provide reasonable estimates
    of our liability with respect to environmental sites, provisions
    have been made in accordance with GAAP. As of December 31,
    2010 and 2009, our undiscounted reserves for such environmental
    liabilities were approximately $1.3 million and
    $2.3 million, respectively. We cannot ensure that
    environmental requirements will not change or become more
    stringent over time or that our eventual environmental

clean-up

costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of our current
    reserves.

Litigation

We have been made parties to a number of actions filed or have
    been given notice of potential claims relating to the conduct of
    our business, including those pertaining to commercial disputes,
    product liability, environmental, safety and health, patent
    infringement and employment matters.



Pentair,
    Inc. and Subsidiaries

Notes to
    consolidated financial statements —
    (continued)

We record liabilities for an estimated loss from a loss
    contingency where the outcome of the matter is probable and can
    be reasonably estimated. Factors that are considered when
    determining whether the conditions for accrual have been met
    include the (a) nature of the litigation, claim, or
    assessment, (b) progress of the case, including progress
    after the date of the financial statements but before the
    issuance date of the financial statements, (c) opinions of
    legal counsel and (d) management’s intended response
    to the litigation, claim, or assessment. Where the reasonable
    estimate of the probable loss is a range, we record the most
    likely estimate of the loss. When no amount within the range is
    a better estimate than any other amount, however, the minimum
    amount in the range is accrued. Gain contingencies are not
    recorded until realized.

While we believe that a material adverse impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash
    flows from any such future charges is unlikely, given the
    inherent uncertainty of litigation, a remote possibility exists
    that a future adverse ruling or unfavorable development could
    result in future charges that could have a material adverse
    impact. We do and will continue to periodically reexamine our
    estimates of probable liabilities and any associated expenses
    and receivables and make appropriate adjustments to such
    estimates based on experience and developments in litigation. As
    a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on our
    consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
    flows for the proceedings and claims could change in the future.

Product
    liability claims

We are subject to various product liability lawsuits and
    personal injury claims. A substantial number of these lawsuits
    and claims are insured and accrued for by Penwald, our captive
    insurance subsidiary. Penwald records a liability for these
    claims based on actuarial projections of ultimate losses. For
    all other claims, accruals covering the claims are recorded, on
    an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has
    been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably
    estimated based on existing information. The accruals are
    adjusted periodically as additional information becomes
    available. In 2004, we disposed of the Tools Group and we
    retained responsibility for certain product claims. We have not
    experienced significant unfavorable trends in either the
    severity or frequency of product liability lawsuits or personal
    injury claims.

Horizon
    Litigation

The Horizon litigation against our subsidiary Essef Corporation
    and certain of its subsidiaries by Celebrity Cruise Lines, Inc.
    (“Celebrity”) was settled by payment of
    $35 million to Celebrity in August 2008, a portion of which
    was covered by insurance. As a result of the settlement, we
    recorded a charge of $20.4 million in 2008 which is shown
    on the line

Legal settlement

in the Consolidated
    Statements of Income.

Warranties
    and guarantees

In connection with the disposition of our businesses or product
    lines, we may agree to indemnify purchasers for various
    potential liabilities relating to the sold business, such as
    pre-closing tax, product liability, warranty, environmental, or
    other obligations. The subject matter, amounts and duration of
    any such indemnification obligations vary for each type of
    liability indemnified and may vary widely from transaction to
    transaction. Generally, the maximum obligation under such
    indemnifications is not explicitly stated and as a result, the
    overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably
    estimated. Historically, we have not made significant payments
    for these indemnifications. We believe that if we were to incur
    a loss in any of these matters, the loss would not have a
    material effect on our financial condition or results of
    operations.

We recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for
    the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the
    guarantee.

We provide service and warranty policies on our products.
    Liability under service and warranty policies is based upon a
    review of historical warranty and service claim experience.
    Adjustments are made to accruals as claim data and historical
    experience warrant.
